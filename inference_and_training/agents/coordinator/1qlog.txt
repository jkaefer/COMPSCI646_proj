L. WALLACE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by EMSH\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic\n    \n   race an inferiority complex—but then he tried to climb it!\n   \n \n \n \n  In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a\npackage. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\nhis wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\nwas flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\nhis head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\nthough narrower ribbons.\n  \n \n  Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\nimitation of speech. 'Yes, I've heard the legend.'\n  \n \n  'It's more than a legend,' said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\nnot unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\nspeculation and nothing more. 'There are at least a hundred kinds of\nhumans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\nwidely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\nages before space travel—\n   \n   and yet each planetary race can interbreed\nwith a minimum of ten others\n   \n  ! That's more than a legend—one hell of a\nlot more!'\n  \n \n  'It is impressive,' admitted Taphetta. 'But I find it mildly\ndistasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\nspecies.'\n  \n \n  'That's because you're unique,' said Halden. 'Outside of your own\nworld, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and\nthat's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\nexception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's\naccidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\ndevelopment.\n  \n \n \n \n  'Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\nbeginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on\nEmmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\nAnd beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's\na corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\nbreed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with\nMeredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\nextend to Kelburn.'\n\nDocument 2 ID: 464\nDocument 2 text: Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt\nthat in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the\ncharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea,\nthe sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they\npierced.\n  \n \n \n   People must have felt like this\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   when Aristarches first\nhinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet\nwas falling dizzily through space. Only it's worse for us, because they\ncouldn't see that anything had changed. We can.\n   \n \n \n  'You need something to cling to,' she heard Madge say. 'Dr. Kometevsky\nwas the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this\nmight happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of\nthe man.'\n  \n \n  She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and\nanxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much\nworse.\n  \n \n  'Of course, there are several more convincing alternate\nexplanations....' Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that\nthere weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated,\nsurely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the\nDisordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance\nphrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist.\nAnd in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you\nadmitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen\nholes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: 'Besides, if\nPhobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been\npicked up by now by 'scope or radar.'\n  \n \n  'Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?' Madge questioned.\n'Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but\nI think' I'm right.'\n  \n \n  And of course she was.\n  \n \n  She swung the book under her arm. 'Whew, it's heavy,' she observed,\nadding in slightly scandalized tones, 'Never been microfilmed.' She\nsmiled nervously and looked them up and down. 'Going to a party?' she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket\njustified the question, but they shook their heads.\n  \n \n  'Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,' Celeste said,\nwhile Theodor explained, 'As it happens, we're bound on business\nconnected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute\na sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.\nAnd since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're\ngoing to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical\nsleight-of-hand.'\n  \n \n  Madge nodded. 'Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be\noff. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.' She\ngave them a woeful grin. 'See you when the Earth jumps.'\n  \n \n  Theodor said to Celeste, 'Come on, dear. We'll be late.'\n  \n \n  But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. 'You know, Teddy,' she said\nuncomfortably, 'all this reminds me of those old myths where too much\ngood fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much\nluck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World\nGovernment started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that\ncouldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of\nthings, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and—' she hesitated a\nbit—'complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where\nam I to find it?'\n  \n \n  'In me,' Theodor said promptly.\n  \n \n  'In you?' Celeste questioned, walking slowly. 'But you're just\none-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or\nIvan.'\n  \n \n  'You angry with me about something?'\n  \n \n  'Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a\ncrisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.'\n  \n \n  'Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,' Theodor\ntold her warmly. 'You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to\nbe punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from\nHeaven and all that?'\n  \n \n  'Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.'\nCeleste smiled. 'I guess none of us realized how much we've come to\ndepend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from\nunder you.'\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded emphatically. 'All the more reason to get a line on\nwhat's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically\nfar-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory\nPerception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days\nthere's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the\nplanet. I'm going to present the evidence at the meeting.'\n  \n \n  Celeste looked up at him. 'So that's why Rosalind's bringing Frieda's\ndaughter?'\n  \n \n  'Dotty is your daughter, too, and Rosalind's,' Theodor reminded her.\n  \n \n  'No, just Frieda's,' Celeste said bitterly. 'Of course you may be the\nfather. One-third of a chance.'\n  \n \n  Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. 'Anyway, Dotty will\nbe there,' he said. 'Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly\nseemed to need more sleep.'\n  \n \n  As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of\nthe path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted\nto the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon.\n  \n \n  'Did you know,' Theodor said suddenly, 'that in\n   \n   Gulliver's Travels\n   \n  Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two\nmoons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately,\ntoo. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and\nliterature.'\n  \n \n  'Stop being eerie,' Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, 'Those\nnames Phobos and Deimos—they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?'\n  \n \n  Theodor lost a step. 'Fear and Terror,' he said unwillingly. 'Now\ndon't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of\nmajor and minor ancient gods had been taken—the bodies in the Solar\nSystem are named that way, of course—and these were about all that\nwere available.'\n  \n \n  It was true, but it didn't comfort him much.\n\n\nFor each of the input documents output exactly with this JSON Schema {\"query_id\":<QUERY_ID>,\"relevance\":[{\"doc_id\":\"237\",  \"is_relevant\":<IS_RELEVANT(Document 1)>,\"is_relevant_explanation\":\"<IS_RELEVANT_EXPLANATION(Document 1)>\"},{\"doc_id\":\"464\",\"is_relevant\":<IS_RELEVANT(Document 2)>,\"is_relevant_explanation\":\"<IS_RELEVANT_EXPLANATION(Document 2)>\"}],\"change_search_query\":<CHANGE_SEARCH_QUERY>,\"new_search_query\":<NEW_SEARCH_QUERY>,\"end_search\":<END_SEARCH>,\"end_search_explanation\":<END_SEARCH_EXPLANATION>}\n\n\nwhere:\n    - <QUERY_ID> is the query ID of the search result.\n    - <DOC_ID> is The document ID of the search result that you want to verify.\n    - <IS_RELEVANT(Document 1)> is a boolean value indicating whether the Document 1 is relevant to the query.\n    - <IS_RELEVANT_EXPLANATION(Document 1)> is an explanation of why Document 1 is relevant or not relevant.\n    - <IS_RELEVANT(Document 2)> is a boolean value indicating whether the Document 2 is relevant to the query.\n    - <IS_RELEVANT_EXPLANATION(Document 2)> is an explanation of why Document 2 is relevant or not relevant.\n    - <CHANGE_SEARCH_QUERY> is a boolean value indicating whether a new search query is needed to find relevant information.

His space pin he\nattached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\nA bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In\nthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\nperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't\nneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\ntitles.\n  \n \n  Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\ncard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\nauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\nscreen and said, 'Balance check, please.'\n  \n \n  In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, 'Ten shares of\nInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\nthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\napiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.' The\nscreen went dead.\n  \n \n  One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\nspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\nwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\nwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n  \n \n  He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\ntwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\nthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\nplace really made sense. The big city.\n  \n \n  He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\nand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\nmight as well do it up brown.\n  \n \n  He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\ncar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\ncontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\ndestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on\nthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\nhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\ngossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n  \n \n  'Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,' he said aloud.\n  \n \n  The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\nshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\nrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\ndirection of the pressure was reversed.\n  \n \n  Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\nsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\ncanopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n  \n \n  A voice said gently, 'If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\nyour credit card within ten minutes.'\n  \n \n  Si took his time.

L. WALLACE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by EMSH\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic\n    \n   race an inferiority complex—but then he tried to climb it!\n   \n \n \n \n  In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a\npackage. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\nhis wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\nwas flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\nhis head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\nthough narrower ribbons.\n  \n \n  Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\nimitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\nnot unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\nspeculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of\nhumans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\nwidely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\nages before space travel—\n   \n   and yet each planetary race can interbreed\nwith a minimum of ten others\n   \n  ! That's more than a legend—one hell of a\nlot more!\"\n  \n \n  \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly\ndistasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\nspecies.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own\nworld, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and\nthat's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\nexception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's\naccidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\ndevelopment.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\nbeginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on\nEmmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\nAnd beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's\na corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\nbreed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with\nMeredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\nextend to Kelburn.\"", "orriginal_id": "BIG_ANCESTOR_1"}, "verified": false}, "464": {"doc": {"id": "464", "text": "Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt\nthat in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the\ncharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea,\nthe sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they\npierced.\n  \n \n \n   People must have felt like this\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   when Aristarches first\nhinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet\nwas falling dizzily through space. Only it's worse for us, because they\ncouldn't see that anything had changed. We can.\n   \n \n \n  \"You need something to cling to,\" she heard Madge say. \"Dr. Kometevsky\nwas the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this\nmight happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of\nthe man.\"\n  \n \n  She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and\nanxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much\nworse.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, there are several more convincing alternate\nexplanations....\" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that\nthere weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated,\nsurely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the\nDisordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance\nphrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist.\nAnd in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you\nadmitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen\nholes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: \"Besides, if\nPhobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been\npicked up by now by 'scope or radar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?\" Madge questioned.\n\"Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but\nI think' I'm right.\"\n  \n \n  And of course she was.\n  \n \n  She swung the book under her arm. \"Whew, it's heavy,\" she observed,\nadding in slightly scandalized tones, \"Never been microfilmed.\" She\nsmiled nervously and looked them up and down. \"Going to a party?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket\njustified the question, but they shook their heads.\n  \n \n  \"Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,\" Celeste said,\nwhile Theodor explained, \"As it happens, we're bound on business\nconnected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute\na sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.\nAnd since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're\ngoing to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical\nsleight-of-hand.\"\n  \n \n  Madge nodded. \"Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be\noff. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.\" She\ngave them a woeful grin. \"See you when the Earth jumps.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor said to Celeste, \"Come on, dear. We'll be late.\"\n  \n \n  But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. \"You know, Teddy,\" she said\nuncomfortably, \"all this reminds me of those old myths where too much\ngood fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much\nluck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World\nGovernment started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that\ncouldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of\nthings, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and—\" she hesitated a\nbit—\"complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where\nam I to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"In me,\" Theodor said promptly.\n  \n \n  \"In you?\" Celeste questioned, walking slowly. \"But you're just\none-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or\nIvan.\"\n  \n \n  \"You angry with me about something?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a\ncrisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,\" Theodor\ntold her warmly. \"You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to\nbe punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from\nHeaven and all that?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.\"\nCeleste smiled. \"I guess none of us realized how much we've come to\ndepend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from\nunder you.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded emphatically. \"All the more reason to get a line on\nwhat's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically\nfar-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory\nPerception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days\nthere's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the\nplanet. I'm going to present the evidence at the meeting.\"\n  \n \n  Celeste looked up at him. \"So that's why Rosalind's bringing Frieda's\ndaughter?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dotty is your daughter, too, and Rosalind's,\" Theodor reminded her.\n  \n \n  \"No, just Frieda's,\" Celeste said bitterly. \"Of course you may be the\nfather. One-third of a chance.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. \"Anyway, Dotty will\nbe there,\" he said. \"Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly\nseemed to need more sleep.\"\n  \n \n  As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of\nthe path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted\nto the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Did you know,\" Theodor said suddenly, \"that in\n   \n   Gulliver's Travels\n   \n  Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two\nmoons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately,\ntoo. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and\nliterature.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop being eerie,\" Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, \"Those\nnames Phobos and Deimos—they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?\"\n  \n \n  Theodor lost a step. \"Fear and Terror,\" he said unwillingly. \"Now\ndon't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of\nmajor and minor ancient gods had been taken—the bodies in the Solar\nSystem are named that way, of course—and these were about all that\nwere available.\"\n  \n \n  It was true, but it didn't comfort him much.", "orriginal_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_2"}, "verified": false}, "360": {"doc": {"id": "360", "text": "To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\nretirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased.

In\nthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\nperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't\nneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\ntitles.\n  \n \n  Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\ncard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\nauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\nscreen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n  \n \n  In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\nInalienable Basic.

He could safely\nspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\nwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\nwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n  \n \n  He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\ntwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\nthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\nplace really made sense. The big city.\n  \n \n  He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\nand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\nmight as well do it up brown.\n  \n \n  He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\ncar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\ncontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\ndestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on\nthe hotels of the island of the Hudson.

Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\ncanopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n  \n \n  A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\nyour credit card within ten minutes.\"\n  \n \n  Si took his time.
