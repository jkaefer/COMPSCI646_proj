{"chunk_id": "A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_2#0", "contents": "Herbert Hyrel settled himself more comfortably in his easy chair, extended his short legs further toward the fireplace, and let his eyes travel cautiously in the general direction of his wife. She was in her chair as usual, her long legs curled up beneath her, the upper half of her face hidden in the bulk of her personalized, three-dimensional telovis. The telovis, of a stereoscopic nature, seemingly brought the performers with all their tinsel and color directly into the room of the watcher. Hyrel had no way of seeing into the plastic affair she wore, but he guessed from the expression on the lower half of her face that she was watching one of the newer black-market sex-operas. In any event, there would be no sound, movement, or sign of life from her for the next three hours. To break the thread of the play for even a moment would ruin all the previous emotional build-up. There had been a time when he hated her for those long and silent evenings, lonely hours during which he was completely ignored. It was different now, however, for those hours furnished him with time for an escape of his own. His lips curled into a tight smile and his right hand fondled the unobtrusive switch beneath his trouser leg. He did not press the switch. He would wait a few minutes longer. But it was comforting to know that it was there, exhilarating to know that he could escape for a few hours by a mere flick of his finger. He let his eyes stray to the dim light of the artificial flames in the fireplace. His hate for her was not bounded merely by those lonely hours she had forced upon him. No, it was far more encompassing. He hated her with a deep, burning savagery that was deadly in its passion. He hated her for her money, the money she kept securely from him. He hated her for the paltry allowance she doled out to him, as if he were an irresponsible child. It was as if she were constantly reminding him in every glance and gesture, \"I made a bad bargain when I married you. You wanted me, my money, everything, and had nothing to give in return except your own doltish self. You set a trap for me, baited with lies and a false front. Now you are caught in your own trap and will remain there like a mouse to eat from my hand whatever crumbs I stoop to give you.\" But some day his hate would be appeased. Yes, some day soon he would kill her! He shot a sideways glance at her, wondering if by chance she suspected.... She hadn't moved. Her lips were pouted into a half smile; the sex-opera had probably reached one of its more pleasurable moments. Hyrel let his eyes shift back to the fireplace again. Yes, he would kill her. Then he would claim a rightful share of her money, be rid of her debasing dominance."}

{"chunk_id": "A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_3#0", "contents": "He let the thought run around through his head, savoring it with mental taste buds. He would not kill her tonight. No, nor the next night. He would wait, wait until he had sucked the last measure of pleasure from the thought. It was like having a bottle of rare old wine on a shelf where it could be viewed daily. It was like being able to pause again and again before the bottle, hold it up to the light, and say to it, \"Some day, when my desire for you has reached the ultimate, I shall unstopper you quietly and sip you slowly to the last soul-satisfying drop.\" As long as the bottle remained there upon the shelf it was symbolic of that pleasurable moment.... He snapped out of his reverie and realized he had been wasting precious moments. There would be time enough tomorrow for gloating. Tonight, there were other things to do. Pleasurable things. He remembered the girl he had met the night before, and smiled smugly. Perhaps she would be awaiting him even now. If not, there would be another one.... He settled himself deeper into the chair, glanced once more at his wife, then let his head lean comfortably back against the chair's headrest. His hand upon his thigh felt the thin mesh that cloaked his body beneath his clothing like a sheer stocking. His fingers went again to the tiny switch. Again he hesitated. Herbert Hyrel knew no more about the telporter suit he wore than he did about the radio in the corner, the TV set against the wall, or the personalized telovis his wife was wearing. You pressed one of the buttons on the radio; music came out. You pressed a button and clicked a dial on the TV; music and pictures came out. You pressed a button and made an adjustment on the telovis; three-dimensional, emotion-colored pictures leaped into the room. You pressed a tiny switch on the telporter suit; you were whisked away to a receiving set you had previously set up in secret. He knew that the music and the images of the performers on the TV and telovis were brought to his room by some form of electrical impulse or wave while the actual musicians and performers remained in the studio. He knew that when he pressed the switch on his thigh something within him—his ectoplasm, higher self, the thing spirits use for materialization, whatever its real name—streamed out of him along an invisible channel, leaving his body behind in the chair in a conscious but dream-like state. His other self materialized in a small cabin in a hidden nook between a highway and a river where he had installed the receiving set a month ago. He thought once more of the girl who might be waiting for him, smiled, and pressed the switch."}

{"chunk_id": "A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_4#0", "contents": "The dank air of the cabin was chill to Herbert Hyrel's naked flesh. He fumbled through the darkness for the clothing he kept there, found his shorts and trousers, got hurriedly into them, then flicked on a pocket lighter and ignited a stub of candle upon the table. By the wavering light, he finished dressing in the black satin clothing, the white shirt, the flowing necktie and tam. He invoiced the contents of his billfold. Not much. And his monthly pittance was still two weeks away.... He had skimped for six months to salvage enough money from his allowance to make a down payment on the telporter suit. Since then, his expenses—monthly payments for the suit, cabin rent, costly liquor—had forced him to place his nights of escape on strict ration. He could not go on this way, he realized. Not now. Not since he had met the girl. He had to have more money. Perhaps he could not afford the luxury of leaving the wine bottle longer upon the shelf.... Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived by bus and a hundred yards of walking, was exclusive. It catered to a clientele that had but three things in common: money, a desire for utter self-abandonment, and a sales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit. The club was of necessity expensive, for self-telportation was strictly illegal, and police protection came high. Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white, silken mask carefully at the door and shoved his sales slip through a small aperture where it was thoroughly scanned by unseen eyes. A buzzer sounded an instant later, the lock on the door clicked, and Hyrel pushed through into the exhilarating warmth of music and laughter. The main room was large. Hidden lights along the walls sent slow beams of red, blue, vermillion, green, yellow and pink trailing across the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous pattern. The colored beams mingled, diffused, spread, were caught up by mirrors of various tints which diffused and mingled the lights once more until the whole effect was an ever-changing panorama of softly-melting shades. The gay and bizarre costumes of the masked revelers on the dance floor and at the tables, unearthly in themselves, were made even more so by the altering light. Music flooded the room from unseen sources. Laughter—hysterical, drunken, filled with utter abandonment—came from the dance floor, the tables, and the private booths and rooms hidden cleverly within the walls. Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied table, sat down and ordered a bottle of cheap whiskey. He would have preferred champagne, but his depleted finances forbade the more discriminate taste. When his order arrived, he poured a glass tumbler half full and consumed it eagerly while his eyes scanned the room in search of the girl. He couldn't see her in the dim swirl of color. Had she arrived? Perhaps she was wearing a different costume than she had the night before. If so, recognition might prove difficult.

Had she arrived? Perhaps she was wearing a different costume than she had the night before. If so, recognition might prove difficult. He poured himself another drink, promising himself he would go in search of her when the liquor began to take effect. A woman clad in the revealing garb of a Persian dancer threw an arm about him from behind and kissed him on the cheek through the veil which covered the lower part of her face. \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his ear. \"Havin' a time?\" He reached for the white arm to pull her to him, but she eluded his grasp and reeled away into the waiting arms of a tall toreador. Hyrel gulped his whiskey and watched her nestle into the arms of her partner and begin with him a sinuous, suggestive dance. The whiskey had begun its warming effect, and he laughed. This was the land of the lotus eaters, the sanctuary of the escapists, the haven of all who wished to cast off their shell of inhibition and become the thing they dreamed themselves to be. Here one could be among his own kind, an actor upon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly metamorphosed from the slug, a knight of old. The Persian dancing girl was probably the wife of a boorish oaf whose idea of romance was spending an evening telling his wife how he came to be a successful bank president. But she had found her means of escape. Perhaps she had pleaded a sick headache and had retired to her room. And there upon the bed now reposed her shell of reality while her inner self, the shadowy one, completely materialized, became an exotic thing from the East in this never-never land. The man, the toreador, had probably closeted himself within his library with a set of account books and had left strict orders not to be disturbed until he had finished with them. Both would have terrific hangovers in the morning. But that, of course, would be fully compensated for by the memories of the evening. Hyrel chuckled. The situation struck him as being funny: the shadowy self got drunk and had a good time, and the outer husk suffered the hangover in the morning. Strange. Strange how a device such as the telporter suit could cause the shadow of each bodily cell to leave the body, materialize, and become a reality in its own right. And yet ..."}

{"chunk_id": "A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5#0", "contents": "He looked at the heel of his left hand. There was a long, irregular scar there. It was the result of a cut he had received nearly three weeks ago when he had fallen over this very table and had rammed his hand into a sliver of broken champagne glass. Later that evening, upon re-telporting back home, the pain of the cut had remained in his hand, but there was no sign of the cut itself on the hand of his outer self. The scar was peculiar to the shadowy body only. There was something about the shadowy body that carried the hurts to the outer body, but not the scars.... Sudden laughter broke out near him, and he turned quickly in that direction. A group of gaily costumed revelers was standing in a semi-circle about a small mound of clothing upon the floor. It was the costume of the toreador. Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened many times before—a costume suddenly left empty as its owner, due to a threat of discovery at home, had had to press the switch in haste to bring his shadowy self—and complete consciousness—back to his outer self in a hurry. A waiter picked up the clothing. He would put it safely away so that the owner could claim it upon his next visit to the club. Another waiter placed a fresh bottle of whiskey on the table before Hyrel, and Hyrel paid him for it. The whiskey, reaching his head now in surges of warm cheerfulness, was filling him with abandonment, courage, and a desire for merriment. He pushed himself up from the table, joined the merry throng, threw his arm about the Persian dancer, drew her close. They began dancing slowly to the throbbing rhythm, dancing and holding on to each other tightly. Hyrel could feel her hot breath through her veil upon his neck, adding to the headiness of the liquor. His feeling of depression and inferiority flowed suddenly from him. Once again he was the all-conquering male. His arm trembled as it drew her still closer to him and he began dancing directly and purposefully toward the shadows of a clump of artificial palms near one corner of the room. There was an exit to the garden behind the palms. Half way there they passed a secluded booth from which protruded a long leg clad in black mesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he recognized that part of the costume. It was she! The girl! The one he had met so briefly the night before! His arm slid away from the Persian dancer, took hold of the mesh-clad leg, and pulled. A female form followed the leg from the booth and fell into his arms. He held her tightly, kissed her white neck, let her perfume send his thoughts reeling. \"Been looking for me, honey?\" she whispered, her voice deep and throaty. \"You know it!\" He began whisking her away toward the palms. The Persian girl was pulled into the booth. Yes, she was wearing the same costume she had worn the night"}

The Persian girl was pulled into the booth. Yes, she was wearing the same costume she had worn the night before, that of a can-can dancer of the 90's. The mesh hose that encased her shapely legs were held up by flowered supporters in such a manner as to leave four inches of white leg exposed between hose top and lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled to suggest innumerable petticoats, fell away at each hip, leaving the front open to expose the full length of legs. She wore a wig of platinum hair encrusted with jewels that sparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded mask was as white as her hair and covered the upper half of her face, except for the large almond slits for her eyes. A white purse, jewel crusted, dangled from one arm. He stopped once before reaching the palms, drew her closer, kissed her long and ardently. Then he began pulling her on again. She drew back when they reached the shelter of the fronds. \"Champagne, first,\" she whispered huskily into his ear. His heart sank. He had very little money left. Well, it might buy a cheap brand...."}
{"chunk_id": "A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_6#0", "contents": "She sipped her champagne slowly and provocatively across the table from him. Her eyes sparkled behind the almond slits of her mask, caught the color changes and cast them back. She was wearing contact lenses of a garish green. He wished she would hurry with her drink. He had horrible visions of his wife at home taking off her telovis and coming to his chair. He would then have to press the switch that would jerk his shadowy self back along its invisible connecting cord, jerk him back and leave but a small mound of clothes upon the chair at the table. Deep depression laid hold of him. He would not be able to see her after tonight until he received his monthly dole two weeks hence. She wouldn't wait that long. Someone else would have her. Unless ... Yes, he knew now that he was going to kill his wife as soon as the opportunity presented itself. It would be a simple matter. With the aid of the telporter suit, he could establish an iron-clad alibi. He took a long drink of whiskey and looked at the dancers about him. Sight of their gay costumes heightened his depression. He was wearing a cheap suit of satin, all he could afford. But some day soon he would show them! Some time soon he would be dressed as gaily.... \"Something troubling you, honey?\" His gaze shot back to her and she blurred slightly before his eyes. \"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned a sickly smile and clutched her hand in his. \"Come on. Let's dance.\" He drew her from the chair and into his arms. She melted toward him as if desiring to become a part of him. A tremor of excitement surged through him and threatened to turn his knees into quivering jelly. He could not make his feet conform to the flooding rhythm of the music. He half stumbled, half pushed her along past the booths. In the shelter of the palms he drew her savagely to him. \"Let's—let's go outside.\" His voice was little more than a croak. \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself away, her low voice maddening him. \"Don't you have a private room? A girl doesn't like to be taken outside....\" Her words bit into his brain like the blade of a hot knife. No, he didn't have a private room at the club like the others. A private room for his telporter receiver, a private room where he could take a willing guest. No! He couldn't afford it! No! No! NO! His lot was a cheap suit of satin! Cheap whiskey! Cheap champagne! A cheap shack by the river.... An inarticulate cry escaped his twisted lips. He clutched her roughly to him and dragged her through the door and into the moonlight, whiskey and anger lending him brutal strength. He pulled her through the deserted garden. All the others had private rooms! He pulled her to the far end, behind a clump of squatty firs. His hands clawed at her. He tried to smother her mouth with"}

If you can't afford one of the private rooms—if you can't afford to show me a good time—if you can't come here real often ...\" The whiskey pounded and throbbed at his brain like blows from an unseen club. His ego curled and twisted within him like a headless serpent. \"I'll have money!\" he shouted, struggling to hold her. \"I'll have plenty of money! After tonight!\" \"Then we'll wait,\" she said. \"We'll wait until tomorrow night.\" \"No!\" he screamed. \"You don't believe me! You're like the others! You think I'm no good! But I'll show you! I'll show all of you!\""}

Then I'll be back!\" \"Silly boy!\" Her low laughter rang hollowly in his ears. \"And just who is it you are going to kill?\" \"My wife!\" he cried. \"My wife! I'll ...\" A sudden sobering thought struck him. He was talking too much. And he wasn't making sense. He shouldn't be telling her this. Anyway, he couldn't get the money tonight even if he did kill his wife. \"And so you are going to kill your wife....\" He blinked the tears from his eyes. His chest was heaving, his heart pounding. He looked at her shimmering form. \"Y-yes,\" he whispered. Her eyes glinted strangely in the light of the moon. Her handbag glinted as she opened it, and something she took from it glittered coldly in her hand. \"Fool!\" The first shot tore squarely through his heart.

She uncoiled her long legs from beneath her, walked to her husband's chair, and stood for a long moment looking down at him, her lips drawn back in contempt. Then she bent over him and reached down his thigh until her fingers contacted the small switch. Seconds later, a slight tremor shook Hyrel's body. His eyes snapped open, air escaped his lungs, his lower jaw sagged inanely, and his head lolled to one side. She stood a moment longer, watching his eyes become glazed and sightless. Then she walked to the telephone. \"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs. Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible has happened to my husband. Please come over immediately. Bring a doctor.\" She hung up, went to her bathroom, stripped off her clothing, and slid carefully out of her telporter suit. This she folded neatly and tucked away into the false back of the medicine cabinet. She found a fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas and got into them. She was just arriving back into the living room, tying the cord of her dressing gown about her slim waist, when she heard the sound of the police siren out front.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city was sacred, but not to its gods. Michaelson was a god—but far from sacred! Crouched in the ancient doorway like an animal peering out from his burrow, Mr. Michaelson saw the native. At first he was startled, thinking it might be someone else from the Earth settlement who had discovered the old city before him. Then he saw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed. He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man was doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were known about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually natives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of the system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent, though uneducated. He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the ancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of time to wonder about him. He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings before him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge with tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square buildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges connected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind after half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony surfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets and filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller buildings. Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins happily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact, marveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to catch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled over the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation of ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog, under a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun. Then he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs."}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_2#0", "contents": "The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving his arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where you are trespassing!\" The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short, even for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up and down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet dragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man. \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said, chidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it beautiful?\" \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\" \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a child. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\" \"You must go.\" \"Why? Who are you?\" \"I am keeper of the city.\" \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was, said, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\" \"The spirits may return.\" Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his trousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say, some alloy impervious to rust and wear.\" \"The spirits are angry.\" \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons, and rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\" \"Leave!\" The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in anger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly serious. \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know that? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half covered with sand and dirt.\" He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The sun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He glanced backward. The webfoot was following. \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped. \"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy the home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of change and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now, or be killed.\""}

Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide, hands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond a huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of the intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him that. Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity. He entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed floors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items, making a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched by the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest detail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books still standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without tools. Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street. He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell of age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered through clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness, dead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in the sun. There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although this was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ... although home was a very great distance away. There was no one back there to worry about him. His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His friends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at least. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a thing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly, without effort save a flicker of thought. \"You did not leave, as I asked you.\" Michaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he relaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\" \"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill you, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat. \"The spirits are angry.\" \"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer than I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like a clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\" \"What rooms?\" \"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were bedrooms.\" \"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was sixty or seventy years old, at least. \"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be educated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some sort. What is it? What does it measure?\" \"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand. \"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the native, trying to feel the life of the city as"}

I'm not a god, and you know it.\" The old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names you mention, are they the names of gods?\" He chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\" \"Maota.\" \"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build a museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just outside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may decipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago and think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and evacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\" Michaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like a waving palm frond and stamped his feet. \"You will leave now.\" \"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They must be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\" \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come here? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who lived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged and preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their foul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\" \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar. Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his body. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his heel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city. The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages rustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while Michaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient street."}

The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short hammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new determination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool wanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command, across five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he remembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked blood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back. The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought a coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind sighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the sand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up. It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over the binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted at the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the writing was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the writing. Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands. \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed. He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the length of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not Maota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he stooped and picked up the book again. \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had touched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring in his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time. A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall, fragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring God-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already destroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the artistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand. I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They say these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's see, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand lifetimes. And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those years! He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery of the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger against the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered the building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\" off the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along the wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His"}

He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\" off the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along the wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over its smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an exclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine. The clock was warm. He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there were people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not be. Half a million years—and here was warmth! He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No mistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He stood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling. Fear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason. He forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled through the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street until he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for air, feeling the pain throb in his head. Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could be accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss of blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail of important discoveries he had no common sense. He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment."}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_6#0", "contents": "When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east. Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in the sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair, familiar to Michaelson. Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\" \"No.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" \"How do you feel?\" \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\" \"Sorry,\" Maota said. \"For what?\" \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\" Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try to break my skull, then you apologize.\" \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\" He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon. It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked like a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its appearance. It was a deadly weapon. \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held it up for Maota to see. \"What about the book?\" \"What kind of book is it?\" \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what kind of book? You have seen it. It is like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it talks.\" \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\" \"Poetry.\" \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history? Why not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a subject worthy of a book.\" Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how they made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must kill you now, so I can get some rest.\" The old man raised the gun."}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_7#0", "contents": "\"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon.\" He pointed to the spot behind his ear where the cylinder was buried. \"I can move faster than you can fire the gun.\" Maota nodded. \"I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will kill you anyway.\" \"I suggest we negotiate.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" Maota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand and wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile, brown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent. \"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated. \"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back. \"Negotiate.\" \"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not twenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far away on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes. \"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just disintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\" Michaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer toward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun. \"Wait!\" \"Now what?\" \"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\" The gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said. Michaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book. \"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\" \"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items around.\" \"It won't break. Throw it.\" Michaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand against his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed through it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for a suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle softly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but his desire to hear the book was strong."}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_8#0", "contents": "Old Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the syntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been a professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley, Browning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations. The old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in sight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages. \"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers, these people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how gentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\" Michaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\" \"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want to close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no slightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is, for spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\" The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly in line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved. Michaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped behind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of existence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun him around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an archeologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man. He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to pick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers, hung on and was pulled to his feet. They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking sand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth, over Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw impersonal shadows down where they fought. Then quite suddenly a finger or hand—neither knew whose finger or hand—touched the firing stud. There was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the total destruction they might have caused. \"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said. A black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and—they could not see how deep—stared at them. Maota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book is gone!\" \"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_9#0", "contents": "Both men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically for the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or care. Finally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area around the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been. \"We killed it,\" the old man moaned. \"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\" \"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It talked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I used to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\" \"There are other books. We'll get another.\" Maota shook his head. \"There are no more.\" \"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\" \"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with songs.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \" You killed it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying forgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too weak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage. When he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've disgraced myself.\" \"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some reasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\" \"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night when I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take them we lose forever.\" \"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never heard of negotiation?\" \"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One either loves them, or kills them.\" \"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\" \"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step from star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\" \"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that. Just an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would ever guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit me and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day I'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than that.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_10#0", "contents": "Maota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\" \"No.\" \"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\" \"It would not work for you.\" \"Why?\" \"Each machine is tailored for each person.\" The old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred hole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking half-heartedly again for the book. \"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human. Why not have a try at negotiating our differences?\" He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's face. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we could think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We have finished, you and I.\" He turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly. Michaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\" \"No.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant. \"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the city?\" \"There are many directions. You would not understand.\" \"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\" \"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\" Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of the city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed against larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading to a particular building. Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\" \"Yes.\" Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around. The room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is this old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing a life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above the bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his fright—thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be. Maota pointed to it. \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid his hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_11#0", "contents": "Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight, then sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he forced a short laugh. \"Maota, you are complex. Why not stop all this mystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\" \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you suppose happened to this race?\" \"You tell me.\" \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know how the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not die out, as a species becomes extinct.\" Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth dimension?\" \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death. I have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people who conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science, who devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the face of the instrument? Press the button, and....\" \"And what?\" \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the streets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now I will do so.\" Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched whine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it then rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly. The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay still. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more carefully. No question about it. The old man was dead."}
{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_12#0", "contents": "Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside the city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and gleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's body on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the knoll. Here he buried him. But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that the old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense more complete than death. In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came to the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building with the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination. Then he searched the books for information about the instrument. Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all evidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He had to know if the machine would work for him. And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows over the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old man's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but determined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the button. The high-pitched whine started. Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes; nothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only like the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left or right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere. \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no direction. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\" Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking through a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body. Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win after all.\" \"Neither did you.\" \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be anywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\" Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the old, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life force—he didn't stop to define it—in his body. Why was his dead body different from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread stretching from the reality of his body to his present state? \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried. I have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication with you. No one can go back.\" Michaelson decided he try."}

{"chunk_id": "A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_13#0", "contents": "\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger. Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and gathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and gave his most violent command. At first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then it struck him. He was standing up! The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference between himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where he went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind, leading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the \"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place. To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result as before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence. \"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger, irrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable. \"I said you were a god. I said you were a god. I said you were a god...! \""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] With never a moment to rest, the pursuit through space felt like a game of hounds and hares ... or was it follow the leader? Ben Curtis eased his pale, gaunt body through the open doorway of the Blast Inn, the dead man following silently behind him. His fear-borne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian gin mill. The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose ingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets. Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco smoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and there, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen, Martians or Venusians. Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it was the dead man's hand. \" Coma esta, senor? \" a small voice piped. \" Speken die Deutsch? Desirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet? \" Ben looked down. The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like a red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn skivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees. \"I'm American,\" Ben muttered. \"Ah, buena ! I speak English tres fine, senor . I have Martian friend, she tres pretty and tres fat. She weigh almost eighty pounds, monsieur . I take you to her, si ?\" Ben shook his head."}

But if you had a drug that'd bring a dead man to life, I'd buy and pay with my soul. \"It is deal, monsieur ? Five dollars or twenty keelis for visit Martian friend. Maybe you like House of Dreams. For House of Dreams—\" \"I'm not buying.\" The dirty-faced kid shrugged. \"Then I show you to good table,— tres bien . I do not charge you, senor .\" The boy grabbed his hand. Because Ben could think of no reason for resisting, he followed. They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and through the drone of alcohol-cracked voices. They passed the bar with its line of lean-featured, slit-eyed Earthmen—merchant spacemen. They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian marble that jutted up into the semi-darkness like fog-blanketed tombstones. Several times, Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CO 2 -breathing Venusians, the first he'd ever seen. They were smoky gray, scaly, naked giants, toads in human shape. They stood solitary and motionless, aloof, their green-lidded eyes unblinking. They certainly didn't look like telepaths, as Ben had heard they were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine. Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City's Security Police. The man was striding down an aisle, idly tapping his neuro-club against the stone booths. Keep walking , Ben told himself. You look the same as anyone else here. Keep walking. Look straight ahead. The officer passed. Ben breathed easier. \"Here we are, monsieur ,\" piped the Martian boy. \"A tres fine table. Close in the shadows.\" Ben winced. How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows? Frowning, he sat down—he and the dead man. He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra. The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for their spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of their cirillas or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider legs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still seemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and forgotten grandeur. For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead man. He thought, What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in a smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world? Couldn't they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me, felt the challenge of new worlds? He sobered. It didn't matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese waiter. He wet his lips but did not drink. His gaze wandered over the faces of the Inn's other occupants. You've got to find him , he thought. You've got to find the man with the red beard. It's the only way you can escape the dead man."}

His body was buried now—probably in the silent gray wastes outside Luna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a part of Ben as sight in his eyes. Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips spitting whiskey-slurred curses. Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist thudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the whiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle from a corner of the gaping mouth. You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or ignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a memory that has burned into your mind. It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had been successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate. He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him. \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you see's spacemen.\" He was a neatly dressed civilian. Ben smiled. \"If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.\" \"The name's Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey suits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a little tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey. Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white, crimson-braided uniform of the Odyssey's junior astrogation officer. He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining uniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe. He'd sought long for that key."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_4#0", "contents": "At the age of five—perhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents' death in a recent strato-jet crash—he'd spent hours watching the night sky for streaking flame-tails of Moon rockets. At ten, he'd ground his first telescope. At fourteen, he'd converted an abandoned shed on the government boarding-school grounds to a retreat which housed his collection of astronomy and rocketry books. At sixteen, he'd spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys Town No. 5 in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. There, among the grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol, he'd found friends who understood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the U. S. Academy for the Conquest of Space. And a month ago, he'd signed aboard the Odyssey —the first ship, it was rumored, equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps beyond. Cobb was persistent: \"Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth. What the hell good is it, jumpin' from planet to planet?\" The guy's drunk , Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three stools down the bar. Cobb followed. \"You don't like the truth, eh, kid? You don't like people to call you a sucker.\" Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and held him there. \"Thas what you are—a sucker. You're young now. Wait ten years. You'll be dyin' of radiation rot or a meteor'll get you. Wait and see, sucker!\" Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger. Now, suddenly and without warning, it welled up into savage fury. His fist struck the man on the chin. Cobb's eyes gaped in shocked horror. He spun backward. His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of the bar. The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of life. He sank to the floor, eyes glassy, blood tricking down his jaw. Ben knew that he was dead. Then, for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror—just as, a moment before, he'd been overwhelmed with anger. He ran."}

At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw that he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the city. He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette. A thousand stars—a thousand motionless balls of silver fire—shone above him through Luna City's transparent dome. He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run. Escaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision. You can do two things , he thought. You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do. That would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary manslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in prison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free. But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new men over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class jet-men on beat-up freighters—they don't want convicted killers. You'd get the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by peeking through electric fences of spaceports. Or— There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who operated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't outlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth. And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the souped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their headquarters was Venus. Their leader—a subject of popular and fantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines—was rumored to be a red-bearded giant. So , Ben reflected, you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously. You can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your name. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your duty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from Earth. After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant second, to destroy a man's life and his dream?"}

But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead voice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways obscure the dead face? So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant, and hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once. \"You look for someone, senor ?\" He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\" \" Oui. \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I keep you company on your first night in Hoover City, n'est-ce-pas ?\" \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\" \"You are spacemen?\" Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will you?\" Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \" Ich danke, senor. You know why city is called Hoover City?\" Ben didn't answer. \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a thousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner, monsieur ?\" Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy. \" Ai-yee , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\" The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness. Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of faces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him—reddish balloon faces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and occasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a face with a red beard. A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of a dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this. He needed help. But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A reward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The Martian kid, perhaps? Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of white. He tensed. Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought. His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness. And then he saw another and another and another. Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a wheel with Ben as their focal point. You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!"}

Ben, half blinded, realized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been turned on. The light washed away the room's strangeness and its air of brooding wickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor. Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and a chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like tatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away. Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward, falling. The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised. A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with feline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained undisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in Ben's direction. \"Curtis!\" one of the policemen yelled. \"You're covered! Hold it!\" Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into which the musicians had disappeared. A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air escaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall ahead of him crumbled. He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the mildly stunning neuro-clubs. Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit. Another second , his brain screamed. Just another second— Or would the exits be guarded? He heard the hiss. It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a slight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_8#0", "contents": "He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be growing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of his body. He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have fifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and body overpowered him. In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice yell, \"Turn on the damn lights!\" Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that someone had seized it. A soft feminine voice spoke to him. \"You're wounded? They hit you?\" \"Yes.\" His thick lips wouldn't let go of the word. \"You want to escape—even now?\" \"Yes.\" \"You may die if you don't give yourself up.\" \"No, no.\" He tried to stumble toward the exit. \"All right then. Not that way. Here, this way.\" Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight flicked on. Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A door closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his vision—if he still had vision. \"You're sure?\" the voice persisted. \"I'm sure,\" Ben managed to say. \"I have no antidote. You may die.\" His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection, massage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain within half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to heart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective weapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender at once. \"Anti ... anti ...\" The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced from his throat. \"No ... I'm sure ... sure.\" He didn't hear the answer or anything else."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_9#0", "contents": "Ben Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening. Return to consciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black nothingness to a dream-like state of awareness. He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders, hands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and sensitivity. He knew they were strong hands. Their strength seemed to transfer itself to his own body. For a long time, he tried to open his eyes. His lids felt welded shut. But after a while, they opened. His world of darkness gave way to a translucent cloak of mist. A round, featureless shape hovered constantly above him—a face, he supposed. He tried to talk. Although his lips moved slightly, the only sound was a deep, staccato grunting. But he heard someone say, \"Don't try to talk.\" It was the same gentle voice he'd heard in the Blast Inn. \"Don't talk. Just lie still and rest. Everything'll be all right.\" Everything all right , he thought dimly. There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing. There were periods of light and of darkness. Gradually he grew aware of things. He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman's oxygen mask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets swathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and he would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach. Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring mist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears: \"Swallow this now. That's it. You must have food.\" Or, \"Close your eyes. Don't strain. It won't be long. You're getting better.\" Better , he'd think. Getting better.... At last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The mist brightened, then dissolved. He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless walls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his aluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket. Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side. \"You are better?\" the kind voice asked."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_10#0", "contents": "The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five and thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking pallor, as if she hadn't used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the same time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her straight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and drawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck. \"I—I am better,\" he murmured. His words were still slow and thick. \"I am going to live?\" \"You will live.\" He thought for a moment. \"How long have I been here?\" \"Nine days.\" \"You took care of me?\" He noted the deep, dark circles beneath her sleep-robbed eyes. She nodded. \"You're the one who carried me when I was shot?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" Suddenly he began to cough. Breath came hard. She held the oxygen mask in readiness. He shook his head, not wanting it. \"Why?\" he asked again. \"It would be a long story. Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.\" A new thought, cloaked in sudden fear, entered his murky consciousness. \"Tell me, will—will I be well again? Will I be able to walk?\" He lay back then, panting, exhausted. \"You have nothing to worry about,\" the girl said softly. Her cool hand touched his hot forehead. \"Rest. We'll talk later.\" His eyes closed and breath came easier. He slept. When he next awoke, his gaze turned first to the window. There was light outside, but he had no way of knowing if this was morning, noon or afternoon—or on what planet. He saw no white-domed buildings of Hoover City, no formal lines of green-treed parks, no streams of buzzing gyro-cars. There was only a translucent and infinite whiteness. It was as if the window were set on the edge of the Universe overlooking a solemn, silent and matterless void. The girl entered the room. \"Hi,\" she said, smiling. The dark half-moons under her eyes were less prominent. Her face was relaxed. She increased the pressure in his rubberex pillows and helped him rise to a sitting position. \"Where are we?\" he asked. \"Venus.\" \"We're not in Hoover City?\" \"No.\" He looked at her, wondering. \"You won't tell me?\" \"Not yet. Later, perhaps.\" \"Then how did you get me here? How did we escape from the Inn?\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_11#0", "contents": "She shrugged. \"We have friends who can be bribed. A hiding place in the city, the use of a small desert-taxi, a pass to leave the city—these can be had for a price.\" \"You'll tell me your name?\" \"Maggie.\" \"Why did you save me?\" Her eyes twinkled mischievously. \"Because you're a good astrogator.\" His own eyes widened. \"How did you know that?\" She sat on a plain chair beside his bed. \"I know everything about you, Lieutenant Curtis.\" \"How did you learn my name? I destroyed all my papers—\" \"I know that you're twenty-four. Born July 10, 1971. Orphaned at four, you attended Boys Town in the Catskills till you were 19. You graduated from the Academy at White Sands last June with a major in Astrogation. Your rating for the five-year period was 3.8—the second highest in a class of fifty-seven. Your only low mark in the five years was a 3.2 in History of Martian Civilization. Want me to go on?\" Fascinated, Ben nodded. \"You were accepted as junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey . You did well on your flight from Roswell to Luna City. In a barroom fight in Luna City, you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb, a pre-fab salesman. You've been charged with second degree murder and escape. A reward of 5,000 credits has been offered for your capture. You came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of spacemen who operate beyond Mars. You were looking for them in the Blast Inn.\" He gaped incredulously, struggling to rise from his pillows. \"I—don't get it.\" \"There are ways of finding out what we want to know. As I told you, we have many friends.\" He fell back into his pillows, breathing hard. She rose quickly. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have told you yet. I felt so happy because you're alive. Rest now. We'll talk again soon.\" \"Maggie, you—you said I'd live. You didn't say I'd be able to walk again.\" She lowered her gaze. \"I hope you'll be able to.\" \"But you don't think I will, do you?\" \"I don't know. We'll try walking tomorrow. Don't think about it now. Rest.\" He tried to relax, but his mind was a vortex of conjecture. \"Just one more question,\" he almost whispered. \"Yes?\" \"The man I killed—did he have a wife?\" She hesitated. He thought, Damn it, of all the questions, why did I ask that? Finally she said, \"He had a wife.\" \"Children?\" \"Two. I don't know their ages.\" She left the room."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_12#0", "contents": "He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side, his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room. He sat straight up, his chest heaving. The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a merchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly trimmed red beard ! Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into restless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his brain. The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes accused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night. And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached down and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and knees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a chilling wail in his ears. His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice screamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed, the giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping relentlessly toward him. He awoke still screaming.... A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a question already formed in his mind. She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\" She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You were looking for him, weren't you?\" \"Who is he?\" She sat on the chair beside him. \"My husband,\" she said softly. He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's why you saved me?\" \"We need all the good men we can get.\" \"Where is he?\" She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and Pluto. He's building a new base for us—and a home for me. When his ship returns, I'll be going to him.\" \"Why aren't you with him now?\" \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been studying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of Investigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how we operate?\" He told her the tales he'd heard."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Coffin_for_Jacob_13#0", "contents": "She nodded. \"There are quite a few of us now—about a thousand—and a dozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole. The dome we're in now was designed and built by us a few years ago after we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction, but with almost every advance in space, someone dies.\" \"Venus is getting too civilized. We're moving out and this dome is only a temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base—I might as well tell you it's going to be an asteroid. I won't say which one.\" \"Don't get the idea that we're outlaws. Sure, about half our group is wanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We're just people like yourself and Jacob.\" \"Jacob? Your husband?\" She laughed. \"Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn't it? Jacob's anything but that. And just plain 'Jake' reminds one of a grizzled old uranium prospector and he isn't like that, either.\" She lit a cigarette. \"Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond the frontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth—not even to Hoover City—except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejects who couldn't get clearance if they went back to Earth. They know nothing but rocketing and won't give up. They bring in our ships to frontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.\" \"Don't the authorities object?\" \"Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to search the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carry cargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that's scarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether it comes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives mining it, that's our business.\" She pursed her lips. \"But if they guessed how strong we are or that we have friends planted in the I. B. I.—well, things might be different. There probably would be a crackdown.\" Ben scowled. \"What happens if there is a crackdown? And what will you do when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can't ignore you then.\" \"Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll be pushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suited boys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It could be us, you know—if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. You can't follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make up your own.\""}

What would happen to me? Would you let me go?\" Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion—alarm, then bewilderment, then fear. \"I don't know. That would be up to Jacob.\" He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched his hand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion that had coursed through her. \"The only thing that matters, really,\" she murmured, \"is your walking again. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?\" \"Okay,\" he said. When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo. He was like two people, he thought. Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one single starry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal. He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she was alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions: \"A Space Officer Is Honest\" \"A Space Officer Is Loyal.\" \"A Space Officer Is Dutiful.\" Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts, mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it prisoner for half a million years. Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead, would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The weatherman was always right: Temperature, 59; humidity, 47%; occasional light showers—but of what? The pockets of Mr. Humphrey Fownes were being picked outrageously. It was a splendid day. The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the humidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in a cloudless blue sky. His pockets were picked eleven times. It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a masterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey Fownes' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He was strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses, one after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions. But he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to begin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so deeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many people were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome Conditions (a crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%) when a bogus postman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the confusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman rifled Fownes's handkerchief and inside jacket pockets."}
{"chunk_id": "A_FALL_OF_GLASS_2#0", "contents": "He was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl happened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his right and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence. The sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time. He should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a heated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his rear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the handkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put and take—the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he was playing. There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass. It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist, hitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of a celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light fragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome weevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the huge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing. Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still intrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity that was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this rather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight surveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting his fingerprints off the postman's bag, and which photographed, X-rayed and chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning them. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a five-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of Paris. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and handedness behind. By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete with photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an orange patrol car parked down the street."}
{"chunk_id": "A_FALL_OF_GLASS_3#0", "contents": "Lanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job. Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes approach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an odd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar to that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and particularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope. Lanfierre's job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn't be tolerated within the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social force; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it, Lanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that genuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own small efforts, rarer. Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable. Lanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes. \"Sometimes his house shakes ,\" Lanfierre said. \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he stopped and frowned. He reread what he'd just written. \"You heard right. The house shakes ,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it. MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of the windshield. \"Like from ... side to side ?\" he asked in a somewhat patronizing tone of voice. \"And up and down.\" MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange uniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed the dossier carelessly on the back seat. Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride couldn't really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride was a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He had even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly absurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was only with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes to MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had seen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly resounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke in an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably trite. Then a fine robust freak came along and the others—the echoes—refused to believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a vacation. \"Why don't you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested. \"It's like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A zephyr?\" \"I've heard some.\" \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong winds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can't imagine. And if there was a house sitting on such a mountain and if winds did blow, it would shake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the whole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down the avenue.\""}

You'll be watching and all of a sudden every single window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned back in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think there's a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal—as if they all had something important to say but had to close the windows first so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city? And then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into conversation—and that's why the house shakes.\" MacBride whistled. \"No, I don't need a vacation.\" A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the windshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel. \"No, you don't need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You're starting to see flying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You've got winds in your brain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality—\" At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed shut. The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound. MacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the ghostly babble of voices to commence. The house began to shake. It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and dipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The house could have been preparing to take off and sail down the.... MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then they both looked back at the dancing house. \"And the water ,\" Lanfierre said. \"The water he uses! He could be the thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole family of thirsty and clean kids, and he still wouldn't need all that water.\" The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages now in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did you see what he carries in his pockets?\" \"And compasses won't work on this street.\" The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed. He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It expressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got neurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There was something implacable about his sighs. \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door with a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at the widow's next door and then the library.\" MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he said. \"Is he in with that bunch?\" Lanfierre nodded. \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly. \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured, watching the house with a consuming interest.

He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation of his was also responsible for the dancing house—he simply hadn't noticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He had a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the high-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the house. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watch from outside. He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room left in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a draw-pull. Every window slammed shut. \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the closet at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that right? No, snug as a hug in a rug . He went on, thinking: The old devils. The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of wheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw that went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had a curious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from grandfather's clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful circles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there was one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He watched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for seven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year. Outside, the domed city vanished. It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear, the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more satisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion. Looking through the window he saw only a garden. Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun setting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left the smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a huge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a garden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses. Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory. And cocktails for two. Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched as the moon played, Oh, You Beautiful Doll and the neon roses flashed slowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on the scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated rose as the moon shifted to People Will Say We're In Love ."}

He had no idea how a rose really smelled—or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. But then, neither did the widow. He'd have to be confident, assertive. Insist on it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic romantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy fingers marching up and down your spine? His own spine didn't seem to be affected. But then he hadn't read that book on ancient mores and courtship customs. How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly long and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount of falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\" meant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the circumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later on this evening. He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker, thinking roguishly: Thou shalt not inundate. The risks he was taking! A shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant Singing in the Rain . Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red sun continued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over and demolished several of the neon roses. The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steering wheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; he gingerly turned it. Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle of winds came to him. He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This was important; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents. The neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose and the moon shook a trifle as it whispered Cuddle Up a Little Closer . He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start. My dear Mrs. Deshazaway. Too formal. They'd be looking out at the romantic garden; time to be a bit forward. My very dear Mrs. Deshazaway. No. Contrived. How about a simple, Dear Mrs. Deshazaway . That might be it. I was wondering, seeing as how it's so late, if you wouldn't rather stay over instead of going home.... Preoccupied, he hadn't noticed the winds building up, didn't hear the shaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected to wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made one gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as high-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the Studebaker valve wider and wider.... The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sun shot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moon fell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning When the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day . The shaking"}

He scrambled upstairs to the Studebaker wheel and shut it off. At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn't the first time the winds got out of line. Why didn't she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all down and went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months, about stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April. Its days were thirty and it followed September. And all the rest have thirty-one. What a strange people, the ancients! He still didn't see the orange car parked down the street."}

All my husbands die.\" \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said. She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don't look at me that way,\" she said. \"I'm not going to marry you and if you want reasons I'll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\" The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything passionately—talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately red. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry tinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had never known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\" she said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for her to be, to explain why she couldn't marry him. \"Do you have any idea what people are saying? They're all saying I'm a cannibal! I rob my husbands of their life force and when they're empty I carry their bodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\" \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there'll be talk.\" \"But it's the air! Why don't they talk about that? The air is stale, I'm positive. It's not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse couldn't stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so healthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily worse for him.\" \"I don't seem to mind the air.\" She threw up her hands. \"You'd be the worst of the lot!\" She left the table, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try some of the asparagus. Five. That's what they'd say. That woman did it again. And the plain fact is I don't want you on my record.\" \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\" He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his shoulders. \"And what about those very elaborate plans you've been making to seduce me?\" Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork. \"Don't you think they'll find out? I found out and you can bet they will. It's my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don't always tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it wasn't the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can't have another man die on me, it's bad for my self-esteem. And now you've gone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\""}

No, no heroics, please! When they ask a man a question he always answers and you will too. You'll tell them I wanted to be courted and when they hear that they'll be around to ask me a few questions. You see, we're both a bit queer.\" \"I hadn't thought of that,\" Fownes said quietly. \"Oh, it doesn't really matter. I'll join Andrew, Curt, Norman—\" \"That won't be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all due respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state here and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\" \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We're lost, you and I.\" \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly. \"That's impossible! How?\" In no hurry, now that he had the widow's complete attention, Fownes leaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway? Space? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has no control whatever? Where the wind blows across prairies ; or is it the other way around? No matter. How would you like that , Mrs. Deshazaway?\" Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her two hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said. \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway. And June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is supposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond the dome.\" \"I see.\" \" And ,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say that somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight, the sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's vernal and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers no longer scintillate.\" \" My. \" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came back to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us outside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays warm long enough for his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ... you may call me Agnes.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_FALL_OF_GLASS_9#0", "contents": "When Humphrey Fownes stepped out of the widow's house, there was a look of such intense abstraction on his features that Lanfierre felt a wistful desire to get out of the car and walk along with the man. It would be such a deliciously insane experience. (\"April has thirty days,\" Fownes mumbled, passing them, \"because thirty is the largest number such that all smaller numbers not having a common divisor with it are primes .\" MacBride frowned and added it to the dossier. Lanfierre sighed.) Pinning his hopes on the Movement, Fownes went straight to the library several blocks away, a shattered depressing place given over to government publications and censored old books with holes in them. It was used so infrequently that the Movement was able to meet there undisturbed. The librarian was a yellowed, dog-eared woman of eighty. She spent her days reading ancient library cards and, like the books around her, had been rendered by time's own censor into near unintelligibility. \"Here's one,\" she said to him as he entered. \" Gulliver's Travels. Loaned to John Wesley Davidson on March 14, 1979 for five days. What do you make of it?\" In the litter of books and cards and dried out ink pads that surrounded the librarian, Fownes noticed a torn dust jacket with a curious illustration. \"What's that?\" he said. \"A twister,\" she replied quickly. \"Now listen to this . Seven years later on March 21, 1986, Ella Marshall Davidson took out the same book. What do you make of that ?\" \"I'd say,\" Humphrey Fownes said, \"that he ... that he recommended it to her, that one day they met in the street and he told her about this book and then they ... they went to the library together and she borrowed it and eventually, why eventually they got married.\" \"Hah! They were brother and sister!\" the librarian shouted in her parched voice, her old buckram eyes laughing with cunning. Fownes smiled weakly and looked again at the dust jacket. The twister was unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like a malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying a Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn't help wondering if twisters did anything to feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit night, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket in his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling after him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though reading inscriptions on a tombstone."}

The members sat around at the miniature tables looking oddly like giants fled from their fairy tales, protesting. \"Where did the old society fail?\" the leader was demanding of them. He stood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. He glanced around at the group almost complacently, and waited as Humphrey Fownes squeezed into an empty chair. \"We live in a dome,\" the leader said, \"for lack of something. An invention! What is the one thing that the great technological societies before ours could not invent, notwithstanding their various giant brains, electronic and otherwise?\" Fownes was the kind of man who never answered a rhetorical question. He waited, uncomfortable in the tight chair, while the others struggled with this problem in revolutionary dialectics. \" A sound foreign policy ,\" the leader said, aware that no one else had obtained the insight. \"If a sound foreign policy can't be created the only alternative is not to have any foreign policy at all. Thus the movement into domes began— by common consent of the governments . This is known as self-containment.\" Dialectically out in left field, Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull in the ensuing discussion and then politely inquired how it might be arranged for him to get out. \"Out?\" the leader said, frowning. \"Out? Out where?\" \"Outside the dome.\" \"Oh. All in good time, my friend. One day we shall all pick up and leave.\" \"And that day I'll await impatiently,\" Fownes replied with marvelous tact, \"because it will be lonely out there for the two of us. My future wife and I have to leave now .\" \"Nonsense. Ridiculous! You have to be prepared for the Open Country. You can't just up and leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. And dialectically very poor.\" \"Then you have discussed preparations, the practical necessities of life in the Open Country. Food, clothing, a weapon perhaps? What else? Have I left anything out?\" The leader sighed. \"The gentleman wants to know if he's left anything out,\" he said to the group. Fownes looked around at them, at some dozen pained expressions. \"Tell the man what he's forgotten,\" the leader said, walking to the far window and turning his back quite pointedly on them. Everyone spoke at the same moment. \" A sound foreign policy ,\" they all said, it being almost too obvious for words."}

Humphrey Fownes' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was one block away from his house. It was then that he realized something unusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police was parked at his front door. And something else was happening too. His house was dancing. It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one's residence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight that for the moment he didn't give a thought to what might be causing it. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its own independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense curiosity. The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch. From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as his favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of cold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A wild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs, suits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa cushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an old, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his ancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room. He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying with his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his cheeks. He got hit by a shoe. As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over his face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room. \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called. Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his dripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the distance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly. \" Winds ,\" he said in a whisper. \"What's happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa. \" March winds,\" he said. \"What?!\" \"April showers!\" The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride's lost voice emerged from the blackness of the living room. \"These are not Optimum Dome Conditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is not 59 degrees. The humidity is not 47%!\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_FALL_OF_GLASS_12#0", "contents": "Fownes held his face up to let the rain fall on it. \"Moonlight!\" he shouted. \"Roses! My soul for a cocktail for two!\" He grasped the doorway to keep from being blown out of the house. \"Are you going to make it stop or aren't you!\" MacBride yelled. \"You'll have to tell me what you did first!\" \"I told him not to touch that wheel! Lanfierre. He's in the upstairs bedroom!\" When he heard this Fownes plunged into the house and fought his way up the stairs. He found Lanfierre standing outside the bedroom with a wheel in his hand. \"What have I done?\" Lanfierre asked in the monotone of shock. Fownes took the wheel. It was off a 1995 Studebaker. \"I'm not sure what's going to come of this,\" he said to Lanfierre with an astonishing amount of objectivity, \"but the entire dome air supply is now coming through my bedroom.\" The wind screamed. \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked. \"Not any more there isn't.\" They started down the stairs carefully, but the wind caught them and they quickly reached the bottom in a wet heap. Recruiting Lieutenant MacBride from behind his sofa, the men carefully edged out of the house and forced the front door shut. The wind died. The fog dispersed. They stood dripping in the Optimum Dome Conditions of the bright avenue. \"I never figured on this ,\" Lanfierre said, shaking his head. With the front door closed the wind quickly built up inside the house. They could see the furnishing whirl past the windows. The house did a wild, elated jig. \"What kind of a place is this?\" MacBride said, his courage beginning to return. He took out his notebook but it was a soggy mess. He tossed it away. \"Sure, he was different ,\" Lanfierre murmured. \"I knew that much.\" When the roof blew off they weren't really surprised. With a certain amount of equanimity they watched it lift off almost gracefully, standing on end for a moment before toppling to the ground. It was strangely slow motion, as was the black twirling cloud that now rose out of the master bedroom, spewing shorts and socks and cases every which way. \" Now what?\" MacBride said, thoroughly exasperated, as this strange black cloud began to accelerate, whirling about like some malevolent top...."}

Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them. \"Fownes!\" MacBride shouted. \"This is a direct order! Make it go back!\" But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging mountainous puffs of glass as he went. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\" he shouted. \"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!\" The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the precipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then, emptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly emptied and then rushed about empty-handed. \"Yoo-hoo!\" he yelled, running. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister. Optimum temperature collapsed. \"Mrs. Deshazaway! Agnes , will you marry me? Yoo-hoo!\" Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited, dazed. There was quite a large fall of glass."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Except for transportation, it was absolutely free ... but how much would the freight cost? \"It is an outrage,\" said Koltan of the House of Masur, \"that the Earthmen land among the Thorabians!\" Zotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, he was in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur. At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his dotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the Pottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and he knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers—Koltan, eldest and Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their treasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in the rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design. \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are these Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength and our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the fame and fortune of the House of Masur.\" \"It is a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's philosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in Lor.\" \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran rather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\" By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen, which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_2#0", "contents": "Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough for him. He would report when the time was ripe. \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his elders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means of transport.\" Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it. The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan. \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime, remember your position in the family.\" Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment. \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of the clay.\" Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they did. Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of his brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_3#0", "contents": "By and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange metal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the city, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of tile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the people to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much too quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to be desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident. The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of Zur. It required but the cooperation—an excellent word, that—of all Zurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in effect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered, for it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a whaling for it. There was also some talk going around about agreements made between the Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one thing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a newspaper, was unknown on Zur. Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously, none had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had tried. The anti-Earthmen Faction—in any culture complex, there is always an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor—crowed happily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too. Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships arrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was practically acrawl with Earthmen. Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called \"corporations\"—Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The object of the visit was trade. In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian city of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took some time for the news to spread. The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the pottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an aluminum pot at him. \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously. \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\" \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my substance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I say!\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_4#0", "contents": "The pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no wonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen are selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay pots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when dropped.\" \"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat, being so light?\" \"The Earthmen don't cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is a paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have to design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\" \"Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do you need a whole new stove for one little pot?\" \"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan will have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are buying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman said so.\" \"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go back to cooking with your old ones.\" \"The Earthman took them in trade—one reason why the new ones are so cheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you will have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use them.\" After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul stamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would accommodate the terrestrial pots very well. And Koltan put the model into production. \"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It was wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to do well by us.\" The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every land."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_5#0", "contents": "In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth. One was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever dreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of the Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from it in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its scanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by the novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book—a primer in the Lorian language—and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the brothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance. Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire—more than enough in value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur—and set up telegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent. Within five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major city on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed the instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business of the House of Masur continued to look up. \"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan, \"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and especially for the House of Masur.\" \"You didn't think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately sorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his unthinkable impertinence. It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their production of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per cent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves greatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but their business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from Earth. About this time, plastic utensils—dishes, cups, knives, forks—made their appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the newfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for everything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade. What they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was. The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of Masur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_6#0", "contents": "Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan called an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his senile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man might still have a little wit left that could be helpful. \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine our business,\" and he read off the figures. \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before, and will result in something even better for us.\" Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly subsided. \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior terrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their eyes, we can be ruined.\" The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while Father Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got nowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up. \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom of your trouble, but the things of Earth. Think of the telegraph and the newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth. The merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these newspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are intrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to buy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you might also have advertisements of your own.\" Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising from the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the advertisements of the Earthmen. In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several things had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal rest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered in the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil regions to every major and minor city on Zur."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_7#0", "contents": "By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the brothers Masur. The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an energetic protest to the governor of Lor. At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that much new building was taking place and wondered what it was. \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan blackly. In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other radio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising—radio programs—with commercials. Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay. \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not paused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be modern—keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they are even bringing autos to Zur!\" The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these hitherto unheard-of vehicles. \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the Earthmen are taking care of that.\" At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made yet."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_8#0", "contents": "Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways were constructed. The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants and began to manufacture Portland cement. You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff made far better road surfacing. The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom. The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising Council.\" \"What is that?\" asked Koltan. \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as yours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain in the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\" The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to Zotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling him in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview. All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the purpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they had to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help. Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated on their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not surprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to make room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved with something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering new automobiles. An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now that they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached with desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and they were the envied ones of Zur. Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands jovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for an indefinite sense of alienness about him. \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping Zotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you straightened out in no time.\""}

{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_9#0", "contents": "All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner. Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur. \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in the world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab Masur—Divinity protect him—departed this life to collect his greater reward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and bones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone is the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and all because of new things coming from Earth.\" Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come to me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has, we're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth—always to do right by the customer.\" \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for damages.\" Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do you own an automobile?\" \"No.\" \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\" Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes the music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\" Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed. \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these luxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off with a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered and installed in your home.\" \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\" \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to you absolutely free—a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is that you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to make profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the Galaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out the full program takes time.\" He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our extremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise, but sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the motto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\""}

{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_10#0", "contents": "The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it was no more than fair to pay transportation. He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\" Broderick told him. \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is sixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the merchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering the cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\" \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together have so much money any more.\" \"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you credit!\" \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically. \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the rich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the involutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that might have had a discouraging effect. On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting. Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do to get credit?\" \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our Easy Payment Plan.\" Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for myself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\" \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each of your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is all there is to it.\" It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul wrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won. \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will have the figures.\" The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul pointed this out politely. \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all, you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be paid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight. This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\" \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our plant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\" \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You will start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain parts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local manufacture to help bring prices down.\" \"We haven't the equipment.\" \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only a quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial company.\""}

{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_11#0", "contents": "Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman, won over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter interest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth. These, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears. The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the Earthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry. For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the new concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a terrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from the crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit. The food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges, served up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the winter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though they had gas-fired central heating. About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric generators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of electrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason, batteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to buy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age? The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan. They had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could possibly sell them. \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but meantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\" But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option. The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because it was so much more efficient—and to lower prices, which was Earth's unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded. Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do. The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth, but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes. The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush business."}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_12#0", "contents": "For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade and a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this backward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was slow, but it was extremely sure. The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less money and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television kept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the pangs of impoverishment. The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul designed and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons were a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold them for less. The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any more, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully. \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with fists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some contracts to continue operating.\" Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr. Broderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him. Would he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would. Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint of toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance. \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He looked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of making it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\" \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul. \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything attached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are attached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that—yet. We will only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your pottery to us.\" The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of beating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was somewhat comforted. \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the governor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of Masur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is time for the government to do something for us.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_13#0", "contents": "The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men covetous and Zurian women envious. \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting you.\" \"Me?\" marveled Zotul. She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a friendly smile. \"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\" Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick, the Earthman. \"I—I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion. Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\" \"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are about to lose our plant.\" \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and richest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have bought you out.\" \"Our government....\" \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took them over, just as we are taking you over.\" \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything on Zur?\" \"Even your armies.\" \"But why ?\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_Gift_From_Earth_14#0", "contents": "Broderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared down moodily into the street. \"You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street like this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible on Earth.\" \"But it's mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\" \"And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has made us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only habitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least populous worlds and—well, buy them out and move in.\" \"And after that?\" Broderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\" Zotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could have been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an idea that didn't occur to you?\" \"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with memory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method causes more distress than we like to inflict, but it's better—and more sure—than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is finished, we can repair the dislocations.\" \"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\" \"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the shoulder. \"Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always, but you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur are equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had to break down your caste system.\" Zotul's eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when I failed!\" \"Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and your brothers to sign?\" \"Yes,\" said Zotul. \"I am ready.\""}

Dear Editor: My 14 year old boy, Ronnie, is typing this letter for me because he can do it neater and use better grammar. I had to get in touch with somebody about this because if there is something to it, then somebody, everybody, is going to point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, \"Why didn't you warn us?\" I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to me because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums. Also they might think I was on booze, too, or maybe the hops, and get my license revoked. I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests might be down on their luck now and then. What really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of two of my guests. They both took a powder last Wednesday morning. Now get this. In one room, that of Joe Binkle, which maybe is an alias, I find nothing but a suit of clothes, some butts and the letters I include here in same package. Binkle had only one suit. That I know. And this was it laying right in the middle of the room. Inside the coat was the vest, inside the vest the shirt, inside the shirt the underwear. The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also the underwear. All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of it and dripped through a crack in the floor. In a bureau drawer were the letters I told you about. Now. In the room right under Binkle's lived another stew bum that checked in Thursday ... name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. This guy was a real case. He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame. Airloom, he says. He pays a week in advance, staggers up the stairs to his room with the mirror and that's the last I see of him. In Smith's room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes, the same suit he wore when he came in. In the coat the vest, in the vest the shirt, in the shirt the underwear. Also in the pants. Also all in the middle of the floor. Against the far wall stands the frame of the mirror. Only the frame! What a spot to be in! Now it might have been a gag. Sometimes these guys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff. But then I read the letters. This knocks me for a loop. They are all in different handwritings. All from different places.

Hold firm in your wretched projection, for tomorrow you will not be alone in the not-world. In two days I, Glmpauszn, will be born. Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirror gateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such tremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus within the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am static and for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe with fear and trepidation. As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got no response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate wave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and returning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing and surrounded with an impregnable chimera. Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the not-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what the not-world calls \"mail\" till we meet. For this purpose I must utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you. Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time. I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary reports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in your task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we return again. The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of Bombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it. Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact location, for the not-people might have access to the information. I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it is alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational likeness. I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among them. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway lies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in order that I might destroy the not-people completely. All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too fast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision. Gezsltrysk, what a task! Farewell till later. Glmpauszn"}

No. When I communicate with you, I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are no terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in not-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my birth. Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited equipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor came in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation reigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What difference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me. As they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally, since I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother (Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up their hands and left. I learned the following day that the opposite component of my not-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance during my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a bender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born. When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I made a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36 not-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was standing by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind. He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of speech. Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I produced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world. \"Poppa,\" I said. This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that are now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded low-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have jarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the room. They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something about my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at the doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth, she fell down heavily. She made a distinct thump on the floor. This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window and retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched, but I eluded them. What unpredictable beings! I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the cleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply from Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise indeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats. But you know old Blgftury.

My process—original with myself, by the way—is to send out feeler vibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I establish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his knowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my letter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he has done. My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an individual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but I fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell you about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have accomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent. In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of sleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out. Anyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here. As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ... my brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard time classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire the stuff needed for the destruction of these people. Sunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the impressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning for me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient mechanism I inhabit. I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions. It was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried immediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up and all about me at the beauty. Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I simply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was to realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not let yourself believe they do. This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here. Her hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She wore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was diverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped. The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from nearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with an attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told myself. But they were. I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you unfortunately do not have—invisibility. I lay there and listened. \"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.

Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now where is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.\" That was it—I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this oversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions that assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty, pain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I must feel each, become accustomed to it. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I have been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe. What will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write you with more enlightenment. Glmpauszn"}

No. Do you express joy, hope, pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five bucks! It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with the correct variant of the slang term \"buck.\" Is it possible that you are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in this inferior world? A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in a struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions of this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world ripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual fluctuations make up our sentient population. Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized by these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets as you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the greatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides are joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational plane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world of higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples. While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer, more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world. They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves into ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily, causing them much agony and fright. The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call mediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one of them at the first opportunity to see for myself. Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked them up while examining the \"slang\" portion of my information catalog which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate cause—in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace of our world—shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short, get hep.

Systematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in our catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed bending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent indeed. Ah! You'll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known quaintly in this tongue as a \"hooker of red-eye.\" Ha! I've mastered even the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me again. I feel much better now. You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that constantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to react exactly as our information catalog instructed me to. Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle, I experience a tickle. This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me again. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely enough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world came most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing here, both among those who haven't got it and those who have. I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and carried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money to a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best hotel here in—no, sorry—and stared at it for hours. Nothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the other about it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for the love of it. Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or fifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare rooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I have failed. This alcohol is taking effect now. Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports! I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've been studying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of these people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these people as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there do homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry. Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.

You never mentioned it in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across to this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a quart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel wonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body. There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this body and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now I can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today outlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must finally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments yet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of the inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his vibrations. I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a blonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was attracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is perfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal. I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember distinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I had dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration. We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you believe it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the money in her bare feet! Then we kissed. Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve ends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the adrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love. I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself quickly. Now in all the motion pictures—true representations of life and love in this world—the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl and tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses. This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn, wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would have a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear? I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I had not found love. I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell asleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin and didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.

I received your revealing letter the morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance things. Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got to the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and continued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again because she said yes immediately. The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the most frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these people really are to our world. The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong psychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I was too busy with the redhead to notice. Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal grandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He concentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in the room. The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white, shapeless cascade of light. Mrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, \"Grandma Lucy!\" Then I really took notice. Grandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury partially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in the fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku was open and his btgrimms were down. Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable pattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the redhead. Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a result of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these not-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality of not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now. The day is only half over and I have consumed a quart and a half. And it is dulling all my powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can't even become invisible any more.

I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I realized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction that inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not aware of the nature of my activities. I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager I was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best customer. \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively. I was baffled. What could I tell him? \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\" \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're—they're—\" \"They're what?\" he wanted to know. \"They're not safe.\" \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\" At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol. \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe.

Perhaps there was method in Colonel Walsh's madness—murder-madness—when he ordered Major Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since we went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor. For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus. He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as I liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At least, that's what he told me. I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were somewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in Space II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of it, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and then. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get by with gravy. \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over his fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral. \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\" I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on the job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his fingers. \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then added, \"For a native, that is.\" I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the way he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there. Which brought to mind an important point. \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I thought our activities were confined to Mars.\" He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk as if he were waiting for me to cut. \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so happens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just what's happening on Mars.\" I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very far. \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If anyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\" If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give them to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called it \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at least a thousand men from Space II. Revolt. \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked"}

Revolt. \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never been to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It was just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place. \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\" At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported him for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium that could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night. He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by reporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in any military organization, he outranked me. \"And the man's name, sir?\" \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face. \"Joe what?\" I asked. \"Just Joe.\" \"Just Joe?\" \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than first names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\" \"I don't know, sir.\" \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said. \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance? Personal habits? Anything?\" Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like any of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He does have a peculiar habit, though.\" \"What's that?\" \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\" I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\" \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\""}
{"chunk_id": "A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_2#0", "contents": "The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on that trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought about Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that revolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started pushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if the whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took over. Swell guy, Walsh. Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic I was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like a mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere I looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd never seen before, and some as bare as cactus. I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me about. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about him was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have been stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to normal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me. I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called. He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance between us in seconds. \"Call me Joe,\" he said. I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this was going to be a simple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said. \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered. \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told him. \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at his use of Terran idiom. \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\" \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a pocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\" \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began wondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking for. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately upon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him anyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a drink first. \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian. \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\" \"Can you take me there?\" I asked. \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a heavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when he dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\" The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that protected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable but I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped the native thirty solars.

Had I tipped him too little? I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it looked as hot as hell. On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to curse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II. There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game and a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged. I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\" \"Call me Joe,\" he answered. He caught me off balance. \"What?\" \"Joe,\" he said again. A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull. \"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about Mars, would you?\" \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\" That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled.... But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like Joe. Among the natives, I mean. Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most contemptible.... \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again. \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\" \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\" I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at the bartender. \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\" \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied. I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a great gag. Very funny. Very.... \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked. \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh. \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's about ready to post you as overdue.\" \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\" \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar. \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender. \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back."}

He was wearing a tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did an officer. \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the desk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it was empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped open. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room. \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked. \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us some, please?\" \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the door behind him. Another Joe , I thought. Another damned Joe. \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly. \"Steal what?\" I asked. \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things they like about Terran culture.\" So Walsh had taken care of that angle too. He does have a peculiar habit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. Cigarettes was the tip I should have given; not solars. \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\" Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked. \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but I think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\" Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it was so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and waited for his explanation. \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said. \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked. \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you know. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\" \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly. \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture. Lots of enlisted men, you know.\" I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful ancestry more keenly. \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\" Bransten was saying. I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh sitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth. \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked. \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain wasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how they are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him Joe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you like to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\" \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly. \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives are a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them—the Joe business, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it.

Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\" Just a case of extended idiot , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose chase a hell of a long way from home. \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\" Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding me that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first Venusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered. I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton stuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical tunic. I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort of thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I twinkled my little gold leaf under his nose. Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat pussy cat. \"What is it, Major?\" he asked. \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\" Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any difficulties, are you?\" \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him a lot sooner if....\" \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\" \"I thought....\" \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you otherwise.\" Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\" \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said. I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those big white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the surprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles away. He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on him. \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\" I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen on my end went blank, too. He's somewhere in the jungle, you know. I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my quarters. As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow. One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping the next ship back to Earth. It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.

It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the Service altogether. Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that jungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a trader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of course, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might really find a guy who was trader Joe. I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and besides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his life. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there was I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though. I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed. A tall Venusian stepped into the room. \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure. \"Who else, boss?\" he answered. \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me into the jungle. Can you get me one?\" \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said. \"How much?\" \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\" \"Who's the guide?\" I asked. \"How's the price sound?\" \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were almost a childish people! \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the planet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do. Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\" \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up around fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\" The Venusian started to leave. \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not overlooking your commission on the deal.\" His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said. When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd just have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on a planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the Captain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me."}
{"chunk_id": "A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_4#0", "contents": "I began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of me. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed like a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something that had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be back again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set for me. Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back. The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider it seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing at the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a few more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken place like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too. But what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in command. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I could understand how much that would appeal to Walsh. I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good points against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A guy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of uranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched, would deliberately do just about anything. Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may have been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a gag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in. The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall, elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far. \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said. \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him. \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\" \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\" \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\" I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled. \"When can we leave?\" \"Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of supplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear light clothing, boots, and a hat.\" \"Will I need a weapon?\" He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\" \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What's your name, by the way?\" He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was definitely surprised. \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn't you know?\""}

{"chunk_id": "A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_5#0", "contents": "When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the boots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it would have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the high boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head. Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be enjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret pleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't see three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes, his head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another. Then he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more impenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly to another village. Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their huts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took me a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide. Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of stinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had I any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low about the whole affair. Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each village he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped gossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye to all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again. His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing that would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He would talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle. \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\" \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked. \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good for Venus. And they are fun.\" \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species Leonard Walsh. \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ... well, you know.\" \"I suppose so,\" I admitted. Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more, that I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been just my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and employee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere began to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about the people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid tests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding sympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.

And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely friendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our grinding pace to find what we were looking for. Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted greenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife gleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled vines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing through them like strips of silk. \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked. \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied. I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\" \"There are more villages,\" he said. \"We'll never find him.\" \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again. \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\" \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply. I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a brilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same feeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my friends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my own house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe reminded me of that friend. \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large now, his eyes shining."}
{"chunk_id": "A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_6#0", "contents": "Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out to greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe. \"What's the story?\" I whispered. He shrugged knowingly and continued walking. And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of the sun like a great silver bullet. \"What...?\" I started. \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling. The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near the nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh standing near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand. \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look cheerful, though. It was pointed at my head. \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his joviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off. Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with happiness. \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said. I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he was getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game. I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\" \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel, Major .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless finality. I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd been. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh pointing the stun gun at my middle. \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\" \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure have.\" Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the smile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm going to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think it'll rain tomorrow.\" Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying this. Another of those funny Terran games. \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I should thank you, really.\" \"You're welcome,\" I said. \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\" \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing when you decided to cork off.\" Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely. \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said. \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have nudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again sometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\" Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely audible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this little spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small, unimportant drama. I could hear Joe breathing beside me. \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished,"}

Terrible.\" Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't understand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the game, the fun? \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was never any trouble before you took command.\" \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\" Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to say about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native. Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it. \"What about the natives?\" I asked. \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while. \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with savages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe. The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the colonel in puzzlement."}

{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_2#0", "contents": "Jon Karyl was bolting in a new baffle plate on the stationary rocket engine. It was a tedious job and took all his concentration. So he wasn't paying too much attention to what was going on in other parts of the little asteroid. He didn't see the peculiar blue space ship, its rockets throttled down, as it drifted to land only a few hundred yards away from his plastic igloo. Nor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue creatures slide out of the peculiar vessel's airlock. It was only as he crawled out of the depths of the rocket power plant that he realized something was wrong. By then it was almost too late. The six blue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching him at a lope. Jon Karyl took one look and went bounding over the asteroid's rocky slopes in fifty-foot bounds. When you're a Lone Watcher, and strangers catch you unawares, you don't stand still. You move fast. It's the Watcher's first rule. Stay alive. An Earthship may depend upon your life. As he fled, Jon Karyl cursed softly under his breath. The automatic alarm should have shrilled out a warning. Then he saved as much of his breath as he could as some sort of power wave tore up the rocky sward to his left. He twisted and zig-zagged in his flight, trying to get out of sight of the strangers. Once hidden from their eyes, he could cut back and head for the underground entrance to the service station. He glanced back finally. Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting after him, and rapidly closing the distance. Jon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol at his side, turned the oxygen dial up for greater exertion, increased the gravity pull in his space-suit boots as he neared the ravine he'd been racing for. The oxygen was just taking hold when he hit the lip of the ravine and began sprinting through its man-high bush-strewn course. The power ray from behind ripped out great gobs of the sheltering bushes. But running naturally, bent close to the bottom of the ravine, Jon Karyl dodged the bare spots. The oxygen made the tremendous exertion easy for his lungs as he sped down the dim trail, hidden from the two steel-blue stalkers. He'd eluded them, temporarily at least, Jon Karyl decided when he finally edged off the dim trail and watched for movement along the route behind him. He stood up, finally, pushed aside the leafy overhang of a bush and looked for landmarks along the edge of the ravine. He found one, a stubby bush, shaped like a Maltese cross, clinging to the lip of the ravine. The hidden entrance to the service station wasn't far off. His pistol held ready, he moved quietly on down the ravine until the old water course made an abrupt hairpin turn. Instead of following around the sharp bend, Jon Karyl moved straight ahead through the overhanging bushes until he came to a dense thicket.

{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_3#0", "contents": "There , just ahead of him, was the lock leading into the service station. Slipping a key out of a leg pouch on the space suit, he jabbed it into the center of the lock, opening the lever housing. He pulled strongly on the lever. With a hiss of escaping air, the lock swung open. Jon Karyl darted inside, the door closing softly behind. At the end of the long tunnel he stepped to the televisor which was fixed on the area surrounding the station. Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures. But he saw their ship. It squatted like a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut tight. He tuned the televisor to its widest range and finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues. He was looking into the stationary rocket engine. As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue came crawling out of the ship. The two Steel-Blues moved toward the center of the televisor range. They're coming toward the station, Karyl thought grimly. Karyl examined the two creatures. They were of the steel-blue color from the crown of their egg-shaped heads to the tips of their walking appendages. They were about the height of Karyl—six feet. But where he tapered from broad shoulders to flat hips, they were straight up and down. They had no legs, just appendages, many-jointed that stretched and shrank independent of the other, but keeping the cylindrical body with its four pairs of tentacles on a level balance. Where their eyes would have been was an elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the egg-head, with its converging ends curving around the sides of the head. Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But where were their masters? The Steel-Blues moved out of the range of the televisor. A minute later Jon heard a pounding from the station upstairs. He chuckled. They were like the wolf of pre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to blow the house down. The outer shell of the station was formed from stelrylite, the toughest metal in the solar system. With the self-sealing lock of the same resistant material, a mere pounding was nothing. Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway. He went up the steel ladder leading to the station's power plant and the televisor that could look into every room within the station. He heaved a slight sigh when he reached the power room, for right at his hand were weapons to blast the ship from the asteroid. Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the lock to the station. His teeth suddenly clamped down on his lower lip. Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes into the stelrylite with round-headed metal clubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't break up that easily. Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up the revolving turret which capped the station so that its thin fin pointed at the squat ship of the invaders. Then he went to the atomic cannon's firing buttons. He pressed first the yellow, then the blue button. Finally the red one.

The thin fin—the cannon's sight—split in half as the turret opened and the coiled nose of the cannon protruded. There was a soundless flash. Then a sharp crack. Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the bolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship of the solar system. There was nothing that could withstand even the slight jolt of power given by the station cannon on any of the Sun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of the ship had changed. A bubble of metal, like a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off the vessel and struck the rocket of the asteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets. He pressed the red button again. Then abruptly he was on the floor of the power room, his legs strangely cut out from under him. He tried to move them. They lay flaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried to lever himself to an upright position. Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed from the waist down. But it couldn't happen that suddenly. He turned his head. A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked tentacle held a square black box. Jon could read nothing in that metallic face. He said, voice muffled by the confines of the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\" \"I am\"—there was a rising inflection in the answer—\"a Steel-Blue.\" There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's face to move. \"That is what I have named you,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\" \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer. Jon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue was telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered. \"We talk in the language of the mind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning with the square black box. The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed the Steel-Blue, aware that the lens he'd seen on the creature's face had a counterpart on the back of the egg-head. Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought. That's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\" Steel-Blue said. There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's mind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he had applied for this high-paying but man-killing job as a Lone Watcher on the Solar System's starways. He had little fear now, only curiosity. These Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical. They could have snuffed out my life very simply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be friends. Steel-Blue chuckled."}

It had been punched full of holes as if it had been some soft cheese instead of a metal which Earthmen had spent nearly a century perfecting. \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue said. \"But that metal also is found on our world. It's probably the softest and most malleable we have. We were surprised you—earthmen, is it?—use it as protective metal.\" \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked, hardly expecting an answer. It came anyway. \"For the same reason you Earthmen are reaching out farther into your system. We need living room. You have strategically placed planets for our use. We will use them.\" Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had been preaching preparedness as Earth flung her ships into the reaches of the solar system, taking the first long step toward the conquest of space. There are other races somewhere, they argued. As strong and smart as man, many of them so transcending man in mental and inventive power that we must be prepared to strike the minute danger shows. Now here was the answer to the scientists' warning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials. \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue. \"I couldn't understand.\" \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered. It was a welcome surprise. Apparently his thoughts had to be directed outward, rather than inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to read it. He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping lock of the invaders' space ship wondering how he could warn Earth. The Space Patrol cruiser was due in for refueling at his service station in 21 days. But by that time he probably would be mouldering in the rocky dust of the asteroid. It was pitch dark within the ship but the Steel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all maneuvering through the maze of corridors. Jon followed him, attached to one tentacle. Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular room, bright with light streaming from a glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently were near topside of the vessel. A Steel-Blue, more massive than his guide and with four more pair of tentacles, including two short ones that grew from the top of its head, spoke out. \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue nodded. \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\" \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\" Jon's guide added. \"Examine him first, then give him the death.\" Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from the lighted room through more corridors. If it got too bad he still had the stubray pistol. Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on the lonely, nerve-wracking job of service station attendant just to see what it offered. Here was a part of it, and it was certainly something new. \"This is the examination room,\" his Steel-Blue said, almost contemptuously. A green effulgence surrounded him."}

{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_5#0", "contents": "There was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the tiny microphone on the outside of his suit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go through his body. Then it seemed as if a half dozen hands were inside him, examining his internal organs. His stomach contracted. He felt a squeeze on his heart. His lungs tickled. There were several more queer motions inside his body. Then another Steel-Blue voice said: \"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of metals that melt at a very low temperature. He also contains a liquid whose makeup I cannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him back when the torture is done.\" Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What kind of torture could this be? Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the chronometer on his wrist. Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien ship and halted expectantly just outside the ship's lock. Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the stubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my way out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he toted up the disadvantages. He either would have to find a hiding place on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues wanted him bad enough they could tear the whole place to pieces, or somehow get aboard the little life ship hidden in the service station. In that he would be just a sitting duck. He shrugged off the slight temptation to use the pistol. He was still curious. And he was interested in staying alive as long as possible. There was a remote chance he might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously, he glanced toward his belt to see the little power pack which, if under ideal conditions, could finger out fifty thousand miles into space. If he could somehow stay alive the 21 days he might be able to warn the patrol. He couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for his life would be snuffed out immediately. The Steel-Blue said quietly: \"It might be ironical to let you warn that SP ship you keep thinking about. But we know your weapon now. Already our ship is equipped with a force field designed especially to deflect your atomic guns.\" Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts quickly. They can delve deeper than the surface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a leash on my thoughts? The Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get—absent-minded, is it?—every once in a while.\" Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared lugging great sheets of plastic and various other equipment. They dumped their loads and began unbundling them. Working swiftly, they built a plastic igloo, smaller than the living room in the larger service station igloo. They ranged instruments inside—one of them Jon Karyl recognized as an air pump from within the station—and they laid out a pallet. When they were done Jon saw a miniature reproduction of the service station, lacking only the cannon cap and fin, and with clear plastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the other.

His Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced the atmosphere of your station so that you be watched while you undergo the torture under the normal conditions of your life.\" \"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked. The answer was almost caressing: \"It is a liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes joints to harden if even so much as a drop remains on it long. It eats away the metal, leaving a scaly residue which crumbles eventually into dust. \"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid for you since No. 1 does not wish you to die instantly. \"Enter your\"—the Steel-Blue hesitated—\"mausoleum. You die in your own atmosphere. However, we took the liberty of purifying it. There were dangerous elements in it.\" Jon walked into the little igloo. The Steel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials and switches on the outside. Jon's space suit deflated. Pressure was building up in the igloo. He took a sample of the air, found that it was good, although quite rich in oxygen compared with what he'd been using in the service station and in his suit. With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet and gulped huge draughts of the air. He sat down on the pallet and waited for the torture to begin. The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo, staring at him through elliptical eyes. Apparently, they too, were waiting for the torture to begin. Jon thought the excess of oxygen was making him light-headed. He stared at a cylinder which was beginning to sprout tentacles from the circle. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. An opening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a spacescope, was appearing in the center of the cylinder. A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the opening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder that had sprouted tentacles. It contained a yellowish liquid. One of the tentacles reached into the opening and clasped the glass. The opening closed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor appendages, moved toward Jon. He didn't like the looks of the liquid in the tumbler. It looked like an acid of some sort. He raised to his feet. He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared to blast the cylinder."}
{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_6#0", "contents": "The cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his eyes jump in his head. He brought the stubray gun up—but he was helpless. The pistol kept on going up. With a deft movement, one of the tentacles had speared it from his hand and was holding it out of his reach. Jon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's hand. But he was too slow. Two tentacles gripped the kicking leg. Another struck him in the chest, knocking him to the pallet. The same tentacle, assisted by a new one, pinioned his shoulders. Four tentacles held him supine. The cylinder lifted a glass-like cap from the tumbler of liquid. Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering an old fairy tale he'd read as a kid. Something about a fellow named Socrates who was given a cup of hemlock to drink. It was the finis for Socrates. But the old hero had been nonchalant and calm about the whole thing. With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious unto death, relaxed and said, \"All right, bub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll take it like a man.\" The cylinder apparently understood him, for it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered his stubray pistol. Jon brought the glass of liquid under his nose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent. It brought tears to his eyes. He looked at the cylinder, then at the Steel-Blues crowding around the plastic igloo. He waved the glass at the audience. \"To Earth, ever triumphant,\" he toasted. Then he drained the glass at a gulp. Its taste was bitter, and he felt hot prickles jab at his scalp. It was like eating very hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears. He coughed as the stuff went down. But he was still alive, he thought in amazement. He'd drunk the hemlock and was still alive. The reaction set in quickly. He hadn't known until then how tense he'd been. Now with the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He laid down on the pallet and went to sleep. There was one lone Steel-Blue watching him when he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and sat up. He vanished almost instantly. He, or another like him, returned immediately accompanied by a half-dozen others, including the multi-tentacled creature known as No. 1. One said, \"You are alive.\" The thought registered amazement. \"When you lost consciousness, we thought you had\"—there was a hesitation—\"as you say, died.\" \"No,\" Jon Karyl said. \"I didn't die. I was just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.\" The Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand. \"Good it is that you live. The torture will continue,\" spoke No. 1 before loping away. The cylinder business began again. This time, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying to figure out what it was. It had a familiar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't quite put a taste-finger on it. His belly said he was hungry. He glanced at his chronometer. Only 20 days left before the SP ship arrived. Would this torture—he chuckled—last until then? But he was growing more and more"}

He glanced at his chronometer. Only 20 days left before the SP ship arrived. Would this torture—he chuckled—last until then? But he was growing more and more conscious that his belly was screaming for hunger. The liquid had taken the edge off his thirst. It was on the fifth day of his torture that Jon Karyl decided that he was going to get something to eat or perish in the attempt. The cylinder sat passively in its niche in the circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching as Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed his stubray. They merely watched as he pressed the stubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked out of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol. The plastic splintered. Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and striding toward his own igloo adjacent to the service station when a Steel-Blue accosted him. \"Out of my way,\" grunted Jon, waving the stubray. \"I'm hungry.\" \"I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,\" said the creature who barred his way. \"Go back to your torture.\" \"But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of your tentacles and eat it without seasoning.\" \"Eat?\" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled. \"I want to refuel. I've got to have food to keep my engine going.\" Steel-Blue chuckled. \"So the hemlock, as you call it, is beginning to affect you at last? Back to the torture room.\" \"Like R-dust,\" Jon growled. He pressed the firing stud on the stubray gun. One of Steel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to the rocky sward. Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used once before. A tentacle danced over it. Abruptly Jon found himself standing on a pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a swath around him 15 feet deep and five feet wide. \"Back to the room,\" Steel-Blue commanded. Jon resheathed the stubray pistol, shrugged non-committally and leaped the trench. He walked slowly back and reentered the torture chamber. The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage he'd done. As he watched them, Jon was still curious, but he was getting mad underneath at the cold egoism of the Steel-Blues. By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by her green fields, and dark forests, he'd stay alive to warn the SP ship. Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send the story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid to it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could equip themselves with spray guns and squirt citric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade away. It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The fruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders—it doesn't sound possible. That couldn't be the answer. Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl discovered a week later. The Steel-Blue who had captured him in the power room of the service station came in to examine him."}

The Steel-Blue who had captured him in the power room of the service station came in to examine him. \"You're still holding out, I see,\" he observed after poking Jon in every sensitive part of his body. \"I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase the power of the—ah—hemlock. How do you feel?\" Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness of hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he answered honestly enough: \"My guts feel as if they're chewing each other up. My bones ache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm so hungry.\" \"That is the hemlock,\" Steel-Blue said. It was when he quaffed the new and stronger draught that Jon knew that his hope that it was citric acid was squelched. The acid taste was weaker which meant that the citric acid was the diluting liquid. It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath the tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive acid. On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak he didn't feel much like moving around. He let the cylinder feed him the hemlock. No. 1 came again to see him, and went away chuckling, \"Decrease the dilution. This Earthman at last is beginning to suffer.\""}
{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_7#0", "contents": "Staying alive had now become a fetish with Jon. On the sixteenth day, the Earthman realized that the Steel-Blues also were waiting for the SP ship. The extra-terrestrials had repaired the blue ship where the service station atomic ray had struck. And they were doing a little target practice with plastic bubbles only a few miles above the asteroid. When his chronometer clocked off the beginning of the twenty-first day, Jon received a tumbler of the hemlock from the hands of No. 1 himself. \"It is the hemlock,\" he chuckled, \"undiluted. Drink it and your torture is over. You will die before your SP ship is destroyed. \"We have played with you long enough. Today we begin to toy with your SP ship. Drink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.\" Weak though he was Jon lunged to his feet, spilling the tumbler of liquid. It ran cool along the plastic arm of his space suit. He changed his mind about throwing the contents on No. 1. With a smile he set the glass at his lips and drank. Then he laughed at No. 1. \"The SP ship will turn your ship into jelly.\" No. 1 swept out, chuckling. \"Boast if you will, Earthman, it's your last chance.\" There was an exultation in Jon's heart that deadened the hunger and washed away the nausea. At last he knew what the hemlock was. He sat on the pallet adjusting the little power-pack radio. The SP ship should now be within range of the set. The space patrol was notorious for its accuracy in keeping to schedule. Seconds counted like years. They had to be on the nose, or it meant disaster or death. He sent out the call letters. \"AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ...\" Three times he sent the call, then began sending his message, hoping that his signal was reaching the ship. He couldn't know if they answered. Though the power pack could get out a message over a vast distance, it could not pick up messages even when backed by an SP ship's power unless the ship was only a few hundred miles away. The power pack was strictly a distress signal. He didn't know how long he'd been sending, nor how many times his weary voice had repeated the short but desperate message. He kept watching the heavens and hoping. Abruptly he knew the SP ship was coming, for the blue ship of the Steel-Blues was rising silently from the asteroid. Up and up it rose, then flames flickered in a circle about its curious shape. The ship disappeared, suddenly accelerating. Jon Karyl strained his eyes. Finally he looked away from the heavens to the two Steel-Blues who stood negligently outside the goldfish bowl. Once more, Jon used the stubray pistol. He marched out of the plastic igloo and ran toward the service station. He didn't know how weak he was until he stumbled and fell only a few feet from his prison. The Steel-Blues just watched him.

He'd been crawling through a nightmare for years when the quiet voice penetrated his dulled mind. \"Take it easy, Karyl. You're among friends.\" He pried open his eyes with his will. He saw the blue and gold of a space guard's uniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness."}
{"chunk_id": "ACID_BATH_8#0", "contents": "He was still weak days later when Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said, \"Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you what they thought was sure death, and it's the only thing that kept you going long enough to warn us.\" \"I was dumb for a long time,\" Karyl said. \"I thought that it was the acid, almost to the very last. But when I drank that last glass, I knew they didn't have a chance. \"They were metal monsters. No wonder they feared that liquid. It would rust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them. No wonder they stared when I kept alive after drinking enough to completely annihilate a half-dozen of them. \"But what happened when you met the ship?\" The space captain grinned. \"Not much. Our crew was busy creating a hollow shell filled with water to be shot out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile thrower. \"These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put traction beams on us and started tugging us toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of atomic shots but when they just glanced off, we gave up. \"They weren't expecting the shell of water. When it hit that blue ship, you could almost see it oxidize before your eyes. \"I guess they knew what was wrong right away. They let go the traction beams and tried to get away. They forgot about the force field, so we just poured atomic fire into the weakening ship. It just melted away.\" Jon Karyl got up from the divan where he'd been lying. \"They thought I was a metal creature, too. But where do you suppose they came from?\" The captain shrugged. \"Who knows?\" Jon set two glasses on the table. \"Have a drink of the best damn water in the solar system?\" He asked Capt. Small. \"Don't mind if I do.\" The water twinkled in the two glasses, winking as if it knew just what it had done. Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories July 1952.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Across the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet of parchment and looked grave. \"This aide memoire,\" he said, \"was just handed to me by the Cultural Attache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the matter of sponsorship of Youth groups—\" \"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\" \"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters are relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age—\" \"That's right. He'll try anything—in the hope it will maim somebody.\" \"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is the important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And sponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the Terrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the mission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p—that is, cement relations with this emergent power group—the leaders of the future. You, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\" \"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their rumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control group—\" \"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This group—\" he glanced at the paper—\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting sponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\" \"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and athletic development,\" Retief said. \"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well anticipate us. They're very active here.\" \"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke instead of us.\" \"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to step forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air. Retief raised one eyebrow. \"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a positive statement.\""}

I wonder if surgery would help.\" \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you would bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical characteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\" \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater than mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience, Mr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise you, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\" Magnan shuddered. \"Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.\" Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the dockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the Fustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your permission, Mr. Ambassador...?\" Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me, Retief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with Youth groups—would create a far better impression.\" \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea to find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes them? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the alignment of this SCARS organization?\" \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said. \"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\" \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a two-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but business. But what has Fust got that they could use?\" \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan. \"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci are barely ahead of them.\" \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like fission bombs.\" Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists for such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your attention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying the social patterns of the local youth.\" \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local youth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\" II Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the chancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car and leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle trundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards. It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty dwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians lumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly wheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces.

Among them, shell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the flat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his back, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the shipyard gates, creaked to a halt. \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian. \"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\" Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up professional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\" He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed. Boards creaked inside. Then the door swung back. A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace peered out at Retief. \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if you don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new liner today.\" \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy arm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist. \"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of papers.\" \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the story of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the vessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\" The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out a sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood silently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines.... \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He turned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the open door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief. \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief. \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on the drawings. He hissed in sudden anger. \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in nightmares! Put by the plans!\" \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\""}
{"chunk_id": "AIDE_MEMOIRE_3#0", "contents": "The youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why should it be secret?\" \"You tell me.\" The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the Fusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said. \"We merely construct a passenger liner.\" \"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who knows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\" The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went for his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get to study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\" \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the shame for the discourtesy of youth.\" Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed through the drawings, clicking the shutter. \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent day by day.\" \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\" \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new. Unknown in my youth was such insolence.\" \"The police—\" \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have we needed ought ere now.\" \"What's behind it?\" \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot mischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with them.\" Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured Groaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed the hut, then started toward it. \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I wonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\" \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled. \"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\" \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\" \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well, stranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance. \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\" He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were raised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate."}
{"chunk_id": "AIDE_MEMOIRE_4#0", "contents": "The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the Embassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He flipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight: \"Retief—I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first dark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive Sponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage, arrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your intransigence.\" Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just time to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep back. Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner and watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline. The nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun and the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray. Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he would be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but the thought failed to keep the chill off. Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward Retief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced. \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No need to crowd up.\" \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was unusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved awkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed. \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\" The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a foot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw his weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell heavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other Youth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied. The Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another vehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car, tiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure. So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight. They were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault, after running a copy for the reference files. And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV battle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval Arm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The term \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in the armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in the Eastern Arm. But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present but himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly Fustian hadn't told them anything. At least not willingly.... Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the flat-car negotiated"}

The old fellow had put up a struggle. There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief followed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of a warehouse. Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the workmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in their siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various fittings in the lock. It snicked open. He eased the door aside far enough to enter. Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle of the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed out of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor before it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over into a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged Fustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head. Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine and pulled the sack free. \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you into this.\" The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell back. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he rumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth, Slock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\" \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\" \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It would be your life.\" \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\" \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light here. But for the toughness of my hide....\" Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of thick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a sound like a seal coughing. \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me—in vain. Then they trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons to complete the task.\" \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\" \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide fuel to the Devil himself.\" \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\" \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full intentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the block and tackle.\" Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it into position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away. The immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest. Slowly he got to his feet. \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\" \"Thanks. I'm Retief.

The immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest. Slowly he got to his feet. \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\" \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right now, let's get out of here.\" Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp, bulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in my wrath. Slock, beware!\" \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He flashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He knelt, sniffed at the spot. \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\" Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite small, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the Groaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first period they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge Moss Rock .\" \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\" \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements after I have settled a score with certain Youths.\" \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I know of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the floor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium pile.\" III Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the sentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the official luxury space barge Moss Rock . \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter. \"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away to sleep.\" \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\" They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box stood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note in the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it. \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of orange and green, a metal bracelet, papers. \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\" \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He passed the metal band to Retief. \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard the name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.\" Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck the charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and fetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm embrace. \"Nice catch, Whonk.

The captive youth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace. \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\" \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\" \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\" \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\" The youth gurgled. \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk lifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump that made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the elder, mouth snapping. \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the killing,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\" \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance with me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\" The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief planted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the bare back of the Fustian— \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried to rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\" Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old. But I thought—\" \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks are deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the carapace and leave the patient living.\" \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us and get out of here. His folks may come home.\" \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned. Three youths came from behind the sheds. \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight. Where's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little bird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers holding the bag, I'll bet.\" \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk. \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars. \"I'll jump around and distract them.\" Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians. They fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief whirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed it against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on Retief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the Moss Rock as Whonk took him in full charge.

Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian on the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed hastily, seriously dented but still mobile. Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids have got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got another errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast, but I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled for a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is enough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\" \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\" \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about this gambit.\" \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth with a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\" \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I know where to find the boss.\""}

Retief scanned the tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the giant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered a hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the air: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music. Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr. Ambassador.\" \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He turned back to the Fustian on his left. \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\" The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the Lament of Hatching ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\" \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of instruments—\" \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial Ambassador suspiciously. \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly. \"And if I may interrupt a moment—\" Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived, perhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\" \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much do you know about them, Mr. Minister?\" \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all Youths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a carapace to tame their irresponsibility.\" \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful energies,\" said Magnan. \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to the dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\" \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on us to make happy these golden hours.\" The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me and pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\" \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\" cried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness—\" \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister said, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled boreholes and blasted.\""}
{"chunk_id": "AIDE_MEMOIRE_7#0", "contents": "\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow! Slop I believe his name is.\" \"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And—\" Magnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to them, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering. Magnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some of the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose. Magnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green wine gushed on the tablecloth. \"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked, breathing deeply. \"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine. \"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd have cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in sideways. There's a matter you should know about—\" \"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine young guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee will be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr. Retief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the pleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\" Retief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I want to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\" \"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to see you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his attention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join me on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to catch a few shots of the presentation.\" Magnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room, took his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras. \"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the great pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly for the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that in our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve during the years ahead.\" Magnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low steps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the newcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival. Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth. Slock stared at him, drew back. \"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk told you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember? It was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're building.\" IV With a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as the Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear of the floor. \"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen. \"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator"}

The Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman at the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed. The next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed by a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby worlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\" Magnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This group was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\" \"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back to Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was planned for today. When the Moss Rock blew, a variety of clues were to be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all over them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair squarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship of the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\" \"The Moss Rock ?\" said Magnan. \"But that was—Retief! This is idiotic. Slock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\" Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip loosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting his way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan watched, open-mouthed. \"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They intended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their purpose.\" \"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is the ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase. Retief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much chance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\" Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through now,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled through to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in Whonk's wake. In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a code letter. No reply. He tried another. \"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's loose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\""}

{"chunk_id": "AIDE_MEMOIRE_8#0", "contents": "In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low cloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The three mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of his immense shell on the heavy plank flooring. \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we bludgeoned aboard the Moss Rock ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced into retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I will rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily feedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no pleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal outlook for one's next thousand years!\" \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play a hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\" \"What—?\" Magnan started. \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk. The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped down, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood vacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone. \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police protection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a position behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring blue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed wrong.... There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding. Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had reappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A small figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed off by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side of the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing Groaci. \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\" \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat bladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of dismembering me out of hand!\" \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\" \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a fellow alien, a fellow soft-back—\" \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now keep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\" The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the ground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was on its back, helpless. \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's caught—and why.\" Whonk came toward the Moss Rock dragging the supine Fustian, who kicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the sentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can outrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and hailed Whonk. Puffing like a steam engine"}

Somebody's been holding out on the rest of you Fustians!\" \"The Soft One,\" Whonk said. \"You laid him by the heels, Retief. I saw. Produce him now.\" \"Hold on a minute, Whonk. It won't do you any good—\" Whonk winked broadly. \"I must take my revenge!\" he roared. \"I shall test the texture of the Soft One! His pulped remains will be scoured up by the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\" Retief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet away, hauled him back to Whonk. \"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial revenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\" \"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim diplomatic immunity!\" \"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with one of those obscenely active eyes—\" He reached.... \"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose—just this once—you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to arrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\" \"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one by one!\" \"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons of them, with the finest of equipment.\" \"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him squash beneath my bulk....\" \"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered. \"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth—\" \"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him four.\" \"Be a sport,\" said Retief. \"Well.\" \"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat, an alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission. Groaci surgical skill is an export that will net you more than armaments. It will be a whissle feather in your cap—if you bring it off. And in return, Whonk won't sit on you. And I won't prefer charges of interference in the internal affairs of a free world.\" Behind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the borrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize him, lift him high and head for the entry to the Moss Rock . \"Hey,\" Retief called. \"Where are you going?\" \"I would not deny this one his reward,\" called Whonk. \"He hoped to cruise in luxury. So be it.\" \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"That tub is loaded with titanite!\" \"Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a vengeance.\" Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp and disappeared within the ship. \"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp, all five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\" Whonk reappeared, alone, climbed down. \"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to—\" \"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk."}

I'll most certainly complain to the Minister.\" \"How about the surgical mission?\" \"A most generous offer,\" said Magnan. \"Frankly, I was astonished. I think perhaps we've judged the Groaci too harshly.\" \"I hear the Ministry of Youth has had a rough morning of it,\" said Retief. \"And a lot of rumors are flying to the effect that Youth Groups are on the way out.\" Magnan cleared his throat, shuffled papers. \"I—ah—have explained to the press that last night's—ah—\" \"Fiasco.\" \"—affair was necessary in order to place the culprits in an untenable position. Of course, as to the destruction of the VIP vessel and the presumed death of, uh, Slop.\" \"The Fustians understand,\" said Retief. \"Whonk wasn't kidding about ceremonial vengeance.\" \"The Groaci had been guilty of gross misuse of diplomatic privilege,\" said Magnan. \"I think that a note—or perhaps an Aide Memoire: less formal....\" \"The Moss Rock was bound for Groaci,\" said Retief. \"She was already in her transit orbit when she blew. The major fragments will arrive on schedule in a month or so. It should provide quite a meteorite display. I think that should be all the aide the Groaci's memoires will need to keep their tentacles off Fust.\" \"But diplomatic usage—\" \"Then, too, the less that's put in writing, the less they can blame you for, if anything goes wrong.\" \"That's true,\" said Magnan, lips pursed. \"Now you're thinking constructively, Retief. We may make a diplomat of you yet.\" He smiled expansively. \"Maybe. But I refuse to let it depress me.\" Retief stood up. \"I'm taking a few weeks off ... if you have no objection, Mr. Ambassador. My pal Whonk wants to show me an island down south where the fishing is good.\" \"But there are some extremely important matters coming up,\" said Magnan. \"We're planning to sponsor Senior Citizen Groups—\" \"Count me out. All groups give me an itch.\" \"Why, what an astonishing remark, Retief! After all, we diplomats are ourselves a group.\" \"Uh-huh,\" Retief said. Magnan sat quietly, mouth open, and watched as Retief stepped into the hall and closed the door gently behind him."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] To the men of the future, the scientific goals of today were as incomprehensible as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail! There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock. What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a chair, or— Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland started to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his brain.... This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through the window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds somewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of stretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he froze, looking up—for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He turned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake. This wasn't his room! The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and the shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green ocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen plant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden beneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees. Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body. His breathing quickened. Now he remembered what had happened during the night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and then—what? Blackout.... Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose? He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As a member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed information that other military powers would very much like to obtain. It was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from the heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done it. How?"}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_2#0", "contents": "He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in the details, he had the impression that there was something wrong about it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no straight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in featureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal, half ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table, built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression of arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish design, something about the room still was not right. His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door. There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of causing it to open. Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window—and realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer. It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars.... Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass! Glass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he hadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages. He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character of the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became aware that he was hungry. Where the devil could this place be? And—muscles tightened about his empty stomach—what was in store for him here? He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless, until a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew his attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his eyes to see what it was. A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they had been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his neck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair. Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he didn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time of year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look Scandinavian.... As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans and showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained for years with weights. They vanished below his field of view, presumably into the building. He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor."}

The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and sandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood up and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he made an unimpressive figure. The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed were the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes. The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin. This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of himself. Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head of a thinker, the body of a trained athlete—an unusual combination. Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where you are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth to protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the guessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile. \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have three meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to leave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that we want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart jumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I want to give you some psychological tests....\" \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here—but it seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give your tests to.\" Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now, come with me.\""}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_4#0", "contents": "After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the center of the room. \"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added, \"Understand one thing—the more you cooperate, the easier things will be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make me.\" \"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\" Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an answer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\" Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed muscles. \"Make me.\" If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\" he said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\" Maitland shook his head stubbornly. \"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\" He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath. He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a clamp that held his head immovable. Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined the others. So—Maitland thought—Swarts could record changes in his skin potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of the body to stimuli. The question was, what were the stimuli to be? \"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four years old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly as applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to question you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is Madison, Wisconsin....\" \"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly, looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\" \"I do not know everything about you—yet.

And I'm testing the equipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your favorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science fiction. Maitland, how would you like to go to the Moon ?\" Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and he tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do you mean?\" Swarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there, didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out why .\""}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_5#0", "contents": "In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid aside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for several seconds. She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that glowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless blouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her body, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what seemed to be white wool. She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like expectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down self-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas. She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak billowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed door for a minute after she was gone. Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded carrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his stomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset and to think. There were three questions for which he required answers before he could formulate any plan or policy. Where was he? Who was Swarts? What was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given? It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the contrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from foreign intelligence officers. It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be cultivated, not allowed to go to grass. This might be somewhere in Africa.... He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away. After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue, a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight, Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of peace and an undefinable longing. Venus, the most beautiful of the planets. Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the constellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he had watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky, its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the horizon, and loved it equally in its alter ego of morning star. Venus was an old friend. An old friend.... Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine,"}

Venus was an old friend. An old friend.... Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and diffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists clenched, forgetting to breathe. Last night Venus hadn't been there. Venus was a morning star just now.... Just now! He realized the truth in that moment."}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_6#0", "contents": "Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out, he lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was. Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what they purported to be. Only one question of importance remained: What year was this? He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of jubilation and excitement. The future ! Here was the opportunity for the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man. Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets. Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars and returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel could reach the stars! And he had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the challenging spaceways between the solar worlds. \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll be a job for me out there....\" If— Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results, but— After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed."}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_7#0", "contents": "He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the evening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell of bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except that she had discarded the white cloak. As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door, carrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her with the word, \"Miss!\" She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face. \"Miss, do you speak my language?\" \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last consonant. \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\" Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her shoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\" \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\" She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\" \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\" She grinned at him again as the door slid shut."}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_8#0", "contents": "Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned offensive. \"What year is this?\" Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he stated. \"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\" \"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to get through this morning.\" \"I know this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century. Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an evening star.\" \"Never mind that. Come.\" Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach the instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started saying a list of words—doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction test—Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc 3 x dx\" in his head. It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts had stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man standing over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled. \"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone. \"We'll try another series of tests.\" It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He lowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks of a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at the ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's eyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes. \"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can blink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down against the tension.\" He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears— And then the show began. He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were footsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open, and outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a twelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you wife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger. There was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless powder—then blackness. With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to slow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test—what was the countermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up. Now he was looking at a girl. She.... Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it. He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had all the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no more. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of Swarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this new world. Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage.

His muscles tightened against the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his forehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated.... The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside. There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps. The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was starting to ache from the effort of blinking. \"What year is this?\" he asked. \"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\" Maitland's smile became a grin."}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_9#0", "contents": "\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said a while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit. If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"' \"Ching?\" \"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\" Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector to his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist. That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering one leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme over and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant mounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn. In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright globe against the constellations.... Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray of food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and revealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table. \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you want, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little of what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th Century. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She laughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so irritated as he was this noon.\" Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed. Eagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century? Believe me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a lot better.\" She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of Technology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself, I think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more exciting....\" \"How do you mean—\" Maitland wrinkled his brow—\"adapt to modern culture? Don't tell me you're from another time!\" \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head of a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much behind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old tongue.\""}

This is a little personal, but ... you don't look altogether like the Norwegians of my time.\" His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely unjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much history since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by Pan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European or Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be cursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but one of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is Lassisi Swarts.\" Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\" \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might have been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals eventually conquered all the world, except for North America—the last remnant of the American World Empire—and southern Africa. The Afrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and they had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They had a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified of being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and it was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings. That went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\" \"So many? How?\" \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies of them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot factories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little shudder. \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons of the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot production system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands raising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done, either, before the population was—reduced to three hundred million.\" \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\""}
{"chunk_id": "AMBITION_11#0", "contents": "She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\" \"Rebellion?\" \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt behind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate expiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one race now. No more masters or slaves.\" They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not talk about them any more.\" \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of transportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\" \"Inter-what?\" \"Have men visited the stars?\" She shook her head, bewildered. \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed. \"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\" He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't understand. Mars? What are Mars?\" After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the matter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely you have space travel?\" She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean—space travel?\" He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\" \"A ship ? Oh, you mean something like a vliegvlotter . Why, no, I don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?\" He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her arms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this perfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is that right?\" She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\" He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he looked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give his life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I would when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\""}

Presently he opened his eyes and looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed obvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd do it.\" Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he was facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know why . What happened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\" \"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated. \"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\" He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her. \"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th Century did want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\" Maitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want to bad enough.\" \"But why ?\" Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick to logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to the population problem....\" \"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that the key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic system was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we have held the number at that.\" \"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work—secret police?\" \"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we cherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those two are the best children we could possibly produce....\" She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what I have been saying applies to most of the world. In some places like Aresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I belong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of them.\" \"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem, there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must be men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in your blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's there and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested in finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of Venus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance of only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he stopped. She shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past—yes! But go out there? I still cannot see why.\" \"Has the spirit of adventure evaporated from the human race, or what ?\" She smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts killed the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time traveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the way I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm."}

We have had our fill of—what is the word?—gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they function right, we are satisfied to forget about them. \"Because this is the Age of Man . We are terribly interested in what can be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying human rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the life and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the Universe. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets.\" Maitland stared at her, his face blank. His mind had just manufactured a discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an earnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into the year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan movement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue in vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the infidel.... Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with troubled eyes. \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while,\" he said."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Is it possible to have a world without moral values? Or does lack of morality become a moral value, also? The first angry rays of the sun—which, startlingly enough, still rose in the east at 24 hour intervals—pierced the lacy tops of Atlantic combers and touched thousands of sleeping Americans with unconscious fear, because of their unpleasant similarity to the rays from World War III's atomic bombs. They turned to blood the witch-circle of rusty steel skeletons around Inferno in Manhattan. Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at the tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three Physicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched the rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a girl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of a nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot that was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things as eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the Institute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially across the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and the ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room. And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers' Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr. It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America of juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America of the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the off-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War and the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly rocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the Institute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please, lover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and crippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet. Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned, polarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's Foundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute, or almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the phrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a deep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and his knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with impartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning. Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.

Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered if he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no, that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important purposes. Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence into his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed. No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them unnecessary. He stepped into his clothing—the severe tunic, tights and sockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message tape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme tablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face broke into a smile. It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making up his life—and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving technique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as somno-learning. He set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\" While it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief message: Dear Fellow Scientist: A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's future in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are available. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the Thinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected the professional men. Now both times are past. May they never return! I would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock sharp, Thinkers' Foundation I. Jorj Helmuth Meanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced through them, hesitated at the name \"Willard Farquar,\" looked at the sleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and plugged in the steno-robot. The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio. \"The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,\" a clear feminine voice announced. \"He has the general staff with him.\" \"Martian peace to him,\" Jorj Helmuth said. \"Tell him I'll be down in a few minutes.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_3#0", "contents": "Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed above the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in the Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls, indicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair on a boom. Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information and questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great cryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its own controls—the permissible ones—and could doubtless improvise a hearing apparatus if it wanted to. For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons. This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human brain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the rims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney Island shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had given instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This was the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved. This was the machine that really thought—a million-plus! This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy professional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the machine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push, had built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and girl-fondness, \"Maizie.\" Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord plucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense, although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape the scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered."}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_4#0", "contents": "The grizzled general—there was also one who was gray—was thinking that this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and usually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his ire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent than himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\" rather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him obscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls which made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's right-minded leaders—even the Thinkers weren't certain which. The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a more turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and the dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble. He asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation be in metal rather than flesh? The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success with Buddhism. Sitting before his guru , his teacher, feeling the Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had felt a little like this. The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets, was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists weren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things, rather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill of the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty sort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better—more disciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie, which helped take the curse off her. Somewhat."}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_5#0", "contents": "The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration. Still, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even the Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie! Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal features, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had handed him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for next year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet minds—profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising simplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were alike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical shorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines. The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly put it away. No one spoke. Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question Four—whom would that come from?\" The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's group. Is anything wrong?\" Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust controls, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting. From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the six officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to get used to the sound of Maizie starting to think."}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_6#0", "contents": "Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie to celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the takeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen. The others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich ochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a silvery mighty spindle. Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here was something that ought to be spang in the center of his official territory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That rocket there—just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered from the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed nuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first spaceship—and the Secretary of Space was not in on it! Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when he remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him from breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole Administration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And that was without taking into consideration the amazing additional mental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars. \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's feeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little devils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\" Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said. \"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely sensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them psychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to contact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and errorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone to glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course, some day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds of the Martians—\" \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned it, Jorj.\" Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great violet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft."}

Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that of such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand relays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes, impishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and, reaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room where a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer. He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as a stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first question, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the staccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the answer. For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon and the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to close his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone, asked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer, then went back to the grind. Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his thinking with his eyes open. The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\" He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive lips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl. Suddenly he began to tape again. \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing, humorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One: The mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\" But his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl."}

The pilot unstrapped himself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the dried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew he had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more than that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho. Used to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the fluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and gyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and parlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of free fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would toss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes she swam for it frantically. After a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer and began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on Mars this trip—priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to war-battered mankind. The cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up on the air, and went to sleep."}

Most of them carefully tucked theirs away with little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over his. \"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked. A remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar Allen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed. The grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess player. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed to play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\" The Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool question like that?\" \"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply. The Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men puzzledly. \"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\" The Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at the Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young Farquar.\" \"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd investigate.\" The Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right away.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_10#0", "contents": "Sunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust motes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was well-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes there were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place of a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly knew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been riskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in New York City. The two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face of the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender—fined down by a long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful, sensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather like a bear. Opperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the Maelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still allow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt. Almost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep on teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've maintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding to their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have overruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults isn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough about this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of this morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\" The features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the Thinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know their Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their Mars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental science is bunk.\" \"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\" Farquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be done until it takes.\" Opperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think you just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which you probably aren't aware.\" Farquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\""}

No, Willard, I'm not counseling appeasement. But consider the age in which we live. It wants magicians.\" His voice grew especially tranquil. \"A scientist tells people the truth. When times are good—that is, when the truth offers no threat—people don't mind. But when times are very, very bad....\" A shadow darkened his eyes. \"Well, we all know what happened to—\" And he mentioned three names that had been household words in the middle of the century. They were the names on the brass plaque dedicated to the martyred three physicists. He went on, \"A magician, on the other hand, tells people what they wish were true—that perpetual motion works, that cancer can be cured by colored lights, that a psychosis is no worse than a head cold, that they'll live forever. In good times magicians are laughed at. They're a luxury of the spoiled wealthy few. But in bad times people sell their souls for magic cures, and buy perpetual motion machines to power their war rockets.\" Farquar clenched his fist. \"All the more reason to keep chipping away at the Thinkers. Are we supposed to beg off from a job because it's difficult and dangerous?\" Opperly shook his head. \"We're to keep clear of the infection of violence. In my day, Willard, I was one of the Frightened Men. Later I was one of the Angry Men and then one of the Minds of Despair. Now I'm convinced that all my reactions were futile.\" \"Exactly!\" Farquar agreed harshly. \"You reacted. You didn't act. If you men who discovered atomic energy had only formed a secret league, if you'd only had the foresight and the guts to use your tremendous bargaining position to demand the power to shape mankind's future....\" \"By the time you were born, Willard,\" Opperly interrupted dreamily, \"Hitler was merely a name in the history books. We scientists weren't the stuff out of which cloak-and-dagger men are made. Can you imagine Oppenheimer wearing a mask or Einstein sneaking into the Old White House with a bomb in his briefcase?\" He smiled. \"Besides, that's not the way power is seized. New ideas aren't useful to the man bargaining for power—only established facts or lies are.\" \"Just the same, it would have been a good thing if you'd had a little violence in you.\" \"No,\" Opperly said. \"I've got violence in me,\" Farquar announced, shoving himself to his feet."}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_12#0", "contents": "Opperly looked up from the flowers. \"I think you have,\" he agreed. \"But what are we to do?\" Farquar demanded. \"Surrender the world to charlatans without a struggle?\" Opperly mused for a while. \"I don't know what the world needs now. Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the philosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\" \"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\" \"No, I leave that to history.\" \"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I intend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically precarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing. Some science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts between the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn neurotics in the Inner Cabinet—and their wives. The fact that the Thinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election. The erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran because of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just a cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of 'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times and points are all that are needed—and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet they're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that we're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us, turning to us for help. You wait and see.\" \"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his first half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals were against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won every battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar short, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but on what the world hasn't got—peace, honor, a good conscience....\" The front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man with a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny cylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at Opperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\" The physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\" The old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off. \"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar chortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\" He held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he asked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\" \"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in deep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going to have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that they'll need our help.\" \"An invitation?\" Farquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious though distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered about my going?

He nodded curtly, face averted. \"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\" \"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly, still not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this invitation?\" Opperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally he said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an academician, cushioned by tradition.\" Willard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police inspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling enterprise.\" \"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe, restricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't exposed to the temptations of the world.\" Farquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow be able to buy me off?\" \"Not exactly.\" \"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded angrily.

{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_14#0", "contents": "As the slideway whisked him gently along the corridor toward his apartment, Jorj was thinking of his spaceship. For a moment the silver-winged vision crowded everything else out of his mind. Just think, a spaceship with sails! He smiled a bit, marveling at the paradox. Direct atomic power. Direct utilization of the force of the flying neutrons. No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a steam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust—processes that were as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself warm. Chemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then would come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella would unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side a gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick and backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the ribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities. Reaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward. In airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the ship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship itself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became exhausted. A spaceship with direct nuclear drive—and he, a Thinker, had conceived it completely except for the technical details! Having strengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting, memory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself of the executive power to control the technicians and direct their specialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket. But that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind Bomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer. They would discover the true laws of ESP and the inner life. They would even—his imagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward—build the true Maizie! And then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the scientists. Rather, they'd be far ahead. No more deception. He was so exalted by this thought that he almost let the slideway carry him past his door. He stepped inside and called, \"Caddy!\" He waited a moment, then walked through the apartment, but she wasn't there."}
{"chunk_id": "Appointment_in_Tomorrow_15#0", "contents": "Confound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she should have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now, when he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a pleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He really should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again there sprang into his mind the word—a pet form of her name—that would send her into obedient trance. No, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment of crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike suddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely a wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding the tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for it, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis. Yet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook his perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if he'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting Tregarron. But this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his boss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the mumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He himself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over strategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie. He stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum relaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he knew would be desirable before the big conference."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] It was a fine day at the beach for Purnie's game—but his new friends played very rough! Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run no more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the ocean at last. When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time. \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\" He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder how tall the trees really were. His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be: the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant, its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and nimbi. With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie hurried toward the ocean. If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now, as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean. He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this day just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and wouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five! \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took care not to brush against it or disturb"}

{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_2#0", "contents": "When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing. He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\" He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends when they learned of his brave journey. The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks. He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea! He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth orange curls waiting to start that action. And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers of munching seaweed. \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time."}

He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest. He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped, not the world around him. He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the tripons who, to him, had just come to life. \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked. The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its repast. Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own. \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\" \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are you going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in San Diego?\" \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter. He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them, tagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\" \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\""}

{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_4#0", "contents": "The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in their heels. \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's your money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just what I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety of the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\" \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\" \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little creatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\" \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\" As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson, will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position he got an upside down view of them walking away. He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway? What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response. Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and went down to where they had stopped further along the beach. \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the vicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\" \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I believe.\" \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've discovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that flag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\" \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively now!\""}
{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_5#0", "contents": "When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along. \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there. \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will slide down on top of us.\" \"Well—that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be solid. It's got to stand at least—\" \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a flag.\" \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it sentiment if you will.\" \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\" \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal? What I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\" \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\" \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man! It's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your space ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\" \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\" When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to himself, content to be in their company. He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see the remainder of the group running toward them. \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the scintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\" \"How about that, Miles?\" \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\""}
{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_6#0", "contents": "Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box. Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\" He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful noises, and he felt most satisfied. \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little chuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\" \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you suppose—\" By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he stood on one leg. \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\" \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\" \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\" \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest—\" \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why, they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors flocking to me. How about it, Benson—does pioneering pay off or doesn't it?\" \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be great danger to the crew—\" \"Now look here! You had planned to put mineral specimens in a lead box, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\" \"He'll die.\" \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and what's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\" Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for, the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their own tricks. He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box. Purnie sat up to watch the show. \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no intention of running away.\" \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\" \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\" \"All right, careful now with that line.\" \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\""}
{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_7#0", "contents": "Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he wiggled in anticipation. He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered. Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to protect himself. He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun. \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back into the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\" The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that, and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box. He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs. \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\" \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's all. Now pick him up.\" The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion. What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had ordered the stoppage of time. The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to understand. As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed, he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.

Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its three legs drawn up into a squatting position. Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll, torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach animals. Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he didn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already abused this faculty."}
{"chunk_id": "BEACH_SCENE_8#0", "contents": "When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the spot where Purnie had been standing. \"My God, he's—he's gone.\" Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope. \"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What did you do with him?\" The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around in front of them, and the next moment he was gone. \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\" \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\" \"Well, I'll be damned!\" \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that you've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\" \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that gun!\" Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide. Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below filled him with hysteria. The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf. Others were pinned down on the sand. \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching his ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me? Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off, tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it about. The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf."}

The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of death. \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\" \"I—I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to drown!\" \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\" \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us here in the water—\" \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's—\" His sounds were cut off by a wavelet gently rolling over his head. Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding the consequences, he ordered time to stop. Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far as his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid, where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore. It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke. Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there. He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock. Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the chaotic scene before him. At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from him. He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness, he knew he must first resume time. Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below. Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered time to resume, nothing happened. His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he wanted to see them safe. He tried to clear his mind"}

Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too. We're either crazy or those damn logs are alive!\" \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water?

Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the others and get out of here while time is on our side.\" \"But what happened, Captain?\" \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old they're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would take super-human energy to move one of those things.\" \"I haven't seen anything super-human.

You all right?\" \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll do anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\" \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along shortly.\" \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen!

He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks, where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf. \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\" \"It's possible, but we're not.\" \"I wish I could be sure.\" \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\" \"I still can't believe it.\" \"He'll never be the same.\" \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back there?\" \"You must be kidding, sir.

You know, scared and mixed up.\" \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\" \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I—I guess I was thinking mostly of myself.\" \"Hmmm.

He wondered what they would say at home when he returned. \"We've made a terrible mistake. We—\" The sounds faded in and out on Purnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered logs and peer around and under them. \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of the others. Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic race an inferiority complex—but then he tried to climb it! In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long though narrower ribbons. Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\" \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was not unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the ages before space travel— and yet each planetary race can interbreed with a minimum of ten others ! That's more than a legend—one hell of a lot more!\" \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my species.\" \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human development. \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle. And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may extend to Kelburn.\""}
{"chunk_id": "BIG_ANCESTOR_2#0", "contents": "Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\" \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists stretched their theories to cover the facts they had. \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout this section of the Milky Way.\" \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\" commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\" \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn. \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the result of parallel evolution—not when a hundred human races are involved, and only the human race.\" \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories about himself.\" It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous though not always the most advanced—Ribboneers had a civilization as high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were others—and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got together—but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin. Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating principle?\" asked Sam Halden. \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\" \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close. We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but was a little further along. When we project back into time those star systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\" The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he was interested."}

This is one arm of it as it is today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and, for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant. There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we calculate the positions of stars in the past.\" Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped the motion. \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said. There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed. Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\" \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\" \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\" \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago !\" \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\" murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that satisfies the calculations?\" \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically. The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the time right.\" Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two ends of the curve cross is your original home?\" \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic light-years—then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it this trip.\" \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them. \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\" \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\" Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn was the most advanced human type present, but while there were differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't as great as once was thought.

It was true that Kelburn was the most advanced human type present, but while there were differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some respect. The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of your pilot, why did you ask for me?\" \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to have an expert—and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational ability.\" Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are the incentives?\" Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the profits from any discoveries we may make.\" \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta, \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me, you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound roll that he had kept somewhere on his person. They glanced at one another as Halden took it. \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take you all day—it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly everywhere in this sector—places men have never been.\" There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed. \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the region toward which we're heading.\""}

He seemed to have difficulty in taking his eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of his place in the human hierarchy. Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter, wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy to see why. Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\" \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more about these things than I do.\" \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still complains.\""}

He breathes through a million tubes scattered over his body.\" It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's reaction was quite typical. \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\" \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do something about it.\" \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing I can do.\" Halden paused thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\" \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\" \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\" \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as fast as they grow.\" \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays. Use them.\" \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that way.\" Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\" It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot. \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden. \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small. \"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\" Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding. They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways. Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\" \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of privileges.\" Halden started. So she knew that the crew was calling her that! Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't said it. It didn't help the situation at all."}

Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never quite still. He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\" Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\" \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\" \"Neither do we.\" The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\" \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A typical pest.\" Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\" \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist. \"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\" \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's smarter?\" \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's strong enough.\" \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical ancestor?\" Emmer didn't look like the genius he was—a Neanderthal genius, but nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy hands through shaggier hair. \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of their camp.\" \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all humans—late or early and male or female—look remarkably alike. If you are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\""}
{"chunk_id": "BIG_ANCESTOR_7#0", "contents": "Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures? Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were forty feet high.\" \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\" \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all, not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five thousand years—and not one of them died that we have a record of.\" \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta. \"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\" \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found. Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us did.\" \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta. \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\" \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked Taphetta. \"We helped them,\" said Emmer. And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of atomic—because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves aloof.

{"chunk_id": "BIG_ANCESTOR_8#0", "contents": "Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this discovery of the unknown ancestor?\" It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing where we came from.\" \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual curiosity.\" \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live? When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than physiology is changed—the pattern of life itself is altered. Things that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\" \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in cultural discoveries.\" \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've achieved that only within the last thousand years.\" \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer. \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics, but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\" Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So, working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and produced us. They were master biologists.\" \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk using bait for your pest.\" He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\" \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as much as you think you will. The difference is this: My terms don't permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\" Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding anything. Halden examined his own attitudes. He hadn't intended, but could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition? He couldn't, and it was too late now—whatever knowledge they acquired would have to be shared. That was what Taphetta had been afraid of—there was one kind of technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now."}

{"chunk_id": "BIG_ANCESTOR_9#0", "contents": "\"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\" Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\" Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a miniature keyboard. \"Ready?\" When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them exactly.\" At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching. Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began nibbling what it could reach. Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up and mauled the other unmercifully. It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none. Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within reach, it climbed into the branches. The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying away, still within range of the screen. Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent defeat. This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged. The small one stood still till the last instant—and then a paw flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed. The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped moving. The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been found— and laid it down ."}

We had an audience.\" \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\" \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough, they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\" \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a creature without real hands?\" \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try—and they'll never get away from the trap to try.\" \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of marrying you.\" \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew that, in relation to her, he was not advanced. \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\" Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To her, I'm merely a passionate savage. They went to his cabin. She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless, except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on the violet end of the spectrum. She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on primeval Earth.\" He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as her own world. She had something else in mind. \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\" \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't have subhuman monsters.\" \"It would be a step up—for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension. It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make them start lower than I am?\" The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another, it governed personal relations between races that were united against non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves. \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly. \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\" It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a permanent"}

But I can't let it lead me astray.\" \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\" \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't like him and he wouldn't marry me.\" \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough. There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\""}

Not even the women of Kelburn's race had a body like hers and she knew it. \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and I would be infertile.\" \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act unconcerned. \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\" His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\" She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh give when his knuckles struck it. She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully. \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the blood and pain.\" She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back and looked at herself critically. \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it healed by morning.\" She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across the bridge. Then she came over to him. \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\" He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage, invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still feel that attraction to her? \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and he's even more savage than I am.\" \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too much, though. You're just right.\" He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what Emmer would do—and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage—what advantage?—for the children she intended to have. Outside of that, nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he wanted her. \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children I have.\" She wriggled into his arms. The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not completely her fault. Besides.... Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior children—and they might be his. He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was.

It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alien life-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rented office. As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see and smell them with ease. My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise in front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens came in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of them eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre beings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old exhibitionist urge. \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to begin. The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official Terran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were accustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals happy wherever I go. Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS!

Auchinleck said unctuously, \"The first applicant is ready to see you, sir.\" \"Send him, her or it in.\" The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body. There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones, one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth. His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. \"You are Mr. Corrigan?\" \"That's right.\" I reached for a data blank. \"Before we begin, I'll need certain information about—\" \"I am a being of Regulus II,\" came the grave, booming reply, even before I had picked up the blank. \"I need no special care and I am not a fugitive from the law of any world.\" \"Your name?\" \"Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.\" I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick cough. \"Let me have that again, please?\" \"Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for Raymond.\" \"Of course, that's not the name you were born with.\" The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation, remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of an apologetic smile. \"My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Birds_of_a_Feather_3#0", "contents": "The little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained. \"You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?\" \"I'll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You'll pay for my services, transportation and expenses. I'll be required to remain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.\" \"And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and transportation.\" The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping on one side, two on the other. \"Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I accept the terms!\" I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into the other office to sign him up. I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show; the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him didn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get to Earth. My conscience won't let me really exploit a being, but I don't believe in throwing money away, either. The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet, four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at anything short of top rate. Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a handout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply of, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get the handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging. The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right."}
{"chunk_id": "Birds_of_a_Feather_4#0", "contents": "It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into the successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in 2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement. Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down, a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo. That's what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is, of course. A zoo. But we don't go out and hunt for our specimens; we advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth once in his lifetime, and there's only one way he can do it. We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms. My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I reach that, I'll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can. After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids, fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks. It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some 400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn't see how we could take one on. They're gentle and likable beings, but their upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan. \"One more specimen before lunch,\" I told Stebbins, \"to make it an even dozen.\" He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long close look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took another one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as I could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman. He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was tall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and though he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look about him. He said, in level Terran accents, \"I'm looking for a job with your outfit, Corrigan.\" \"There's been a mistake. We're interested in non-terrestrials only.\" \"I'm a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz XIII.\""}

You're as Earthborn as I am.\" \"I've never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,\" he said smoothly. \"I happen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists anywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small and little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary fluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don't you want me in your circus?\" \"No. And it's not a circus. It's—\" \"A scientific institute. I stand corrected.\" There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on his ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you're from such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\" \"I'm not speaking. I'm a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate back to colloquial speech.\" \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin a good yarn—but for my money, you're really Sam Jones or Phil Smith from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\" He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You're making a big mistake. I'm just what your outfit needs. A representative of a hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect! Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—\" I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated. \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn't much. I'll be a big attraction. I'll—\" \" Good-by, Mr. Gorb! \" He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to the door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think it over. Maybe you'll regret your hastiness. I'll be back to give you another chance.\" He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile. This was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get a job! But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness intellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket home. I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands."}

{"chunk_id": "Birds_of_a_Feather_6#0", "contents": "The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan, and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds. Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him officially. He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high, and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture, and growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me immediately to a contract.\" \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\" \"You will grant me a contract!\" \"Will you please sit down?\" He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\" \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of trouble. The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, and this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his warlike race. I said, \"You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not our policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our Institute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males, because—\" \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\" I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty. The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have four representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn! For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to the noble Clan Gursdrinn!\" At the key-word avenge , I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he didn't move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\""}
{"chunk_id": "Birds_of_a_Feather_7#0", "contents": "I'm a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and one of the most important of those principles is that I never let myself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\" He glared at me in silence. I went on, \"Please be assured that I'll undo the insult at the earliest possible opportunity. It's not feasible for us to hire another Kallerian now, but I'll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon as a vacancy—\" \"No. You will hire me now.\" \"It can't be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to it.\" \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\" \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I'll get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—\" You'd think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there's always the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we're insulting all the others. I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left. They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him away. He wasn't minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw, but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was out in the hall. I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins. \"Come here, you!\" \"Stebbins?\" I said gently. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he came running in—\" \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you, honored sir!\" \"It isn't his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least fifty ahead of him.\" \"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he's in here already, I might as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\" Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out."}
{"chunk_id": "Birds_of_a_Feather_8#0", "contents": "The alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at full volume. \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with yourself.\" I said, \"I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're already carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a female now and—\" \"This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?\" I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian entry. \"Yes, that's her name.\" The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she! It is she!\" \"I'm afraid we don't have room for any more—\" \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress, she is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life and my love.\" \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was single. It's right here on the chart.\" \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry, languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You must take me to Earth!\" \"But—\" \"I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must reason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her inner flame? I must bring her back! \" My face was expressionless. \"You don't really intend to join our organization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?\" \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race, if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead lump of stone?\""}

I felt sorry for this being's domestic troubles, but I wasn't going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel happy—not to mention footing the transportation. I said, \"I don't see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in coming isn't scientific, I can't in all conscience lie for you, can I?\" \"Well—\" \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right along. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up, I might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your heart to me.\" \"I thought the truth would move you.\" \"It did. But in effect you're now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent criminal act. Friend, I can't do it. My reputation means too much to me,\" I said piously. \"Then you will refuse me?\" \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can't take you to Earth.\" \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\" There's a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn't pull a low trick like that on our female Stortulian. I said, \"I'll ask her about coming home. But I won't ship her back against her will. And maybe she's happier where she is.\" The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\" He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping. I watched him shuffle out. I do have some conscience, and I had the uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to commit suicide on my account."}

The rest were unacceptable for one reason or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract. I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's outraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII stepped in. \"How did you get in here?\" I demanded. \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily. \"Change your mind about me yet?\" \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\" Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changed my pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I tell you that I am Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on your staff.\" \"I don't care what your story is! Get out or—\" \"—you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second. Corrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours outside is .

There's been a Kallerian in here who just about threatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's about to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troubling me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and go home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me. I'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to claiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is that I'm not looking for any of those either. Now will you scram or—\" The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian, came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt. \"Sorry, Chief,\" Stebbins gasped. \"I tried to keep him out, but—\" Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out with a roar. \"Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!\""}

He toppled forward onto the carpet with the sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him. Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me. \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked. \"Y-yes.\" \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint being—\" \"—that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of the Ghrynian policemen. \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several minutes ago.\" \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\" \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and I'm responsible?\" \"This is the law.

If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was going to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000 per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall. I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced arrival. The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a moment and turned to eye the newcomer. I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I did come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against crackpots. In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me to do.\" I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers going down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself! He's—\" Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I guess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on. Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting himself off. He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that Stortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get you.\" I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh. \"Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian psychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely abhorrent to them.

I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against the local laws?\" \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the Ghrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian and the fine of—\" \"—one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to Stebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them send down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get out of this mess with our skins intact.\" \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone. Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest. \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can't help you. I can.\" \"You?\" I said. \"I can get you out of this cheap.\" \" How cheap?\" Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of a lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?\" I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn't be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand, giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition. \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You've got yourself a deal—but on a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand and the contract. Otherwise, nothing.\" Gorb shrugged. \"What have I to lose?\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate! The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner. Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was almost ordinary-looking. As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably hideous. Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century. The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt he was, which was what mattered. \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me buy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the same for my fellow-man here.\" The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth hastily supplied by the management. \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look at them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\" You could use one was implied. And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance, was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's handsome face."}

Then, seeing the forces now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to smash back, and now it was too late for that. Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. \"So, it's you again?\" The man in the gray suit smiled. \"Who else in any world would stand up for you?\" \"I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you around, of course,\" Gabriel added too quickly. \"You do come in useful at times, you know.\" \"So you don't mind having me around?\" The nondescript man smiled again. \"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?\" Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. \"Come on, have a drink with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.\" \"I drank with you once too often,\" the nondescript man said. \"And things worked out fine, didn't they? For you.\" His eyes studied the other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were not pleased with what they saw. \"Watch yourself, colleague,\" he warned as he left. \"Soon you might not be worth the saving.\" \"Who was that, Gabe?\" the girl asked. He shrugged. \"I never saw him before in my life.\" Of course, knowing him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he happened to have been telling the truth."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_3#0", "contents": "Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions, reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to the letter combination bodyguard , he went out into the street. If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for years. The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\" the driver asked. \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there. \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\" But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head. \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was wanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\" \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\" The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the teleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit suicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\" \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin smile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it happens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a thrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy. \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the window. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ... anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\" \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a commission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly. \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\" \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\" \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly. II It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn. \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he shook his handsome head. \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly, referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held, and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek. Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little town, they didn't have far to fall.

Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little town, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist. To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames. Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him speculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled—shock had sobered him a little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have thrown me back in.\" \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed. The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall that he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\" \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked, glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern. \" Mrs. ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl. \"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\" \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said, looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope you'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too. Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them. There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and beginning to slide downhill.... Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_4#0", "contents": "There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before, which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket closer about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your—your friend to me, Gabe?\" \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\" \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification card from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks ago, and now he isn't ... anything.\" \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token of my—of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation held little gratitude. The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money, thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband, \"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the future! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\" Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise—I'll be careful.\" When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night, the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification. Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care. Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of \"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator; otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse."}

{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_5#0", "contents": "Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs. Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been big money in musical chairs as such. When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet. The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible. But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened. The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but, when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew everybody else far too well. The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in coming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed too logical for the man he was haunting. However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green creature in the slightly frayed robe asked. \"One,\" the fat man answered. III The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile patterns.

The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only weighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you two to come out to a place like this?\" \"I really think Gabriel must be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly to herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse. It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\" \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up. The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you are the same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\" The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of them.\" \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?\" Automatically she reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_6#0", "contents": "He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking. \"But why do you do it? Why! Do you like it? Or is it because of Gabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was included in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you; is that it?\" \"Ask him.\" \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I think?\" There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not, she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so casually."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_7#0", "contents": "It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from some animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about herself. The thin young man began to cough again. Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk of the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of them would stay.... \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then do you keep helping him?\" \"I am not helping him . And he knows that.\" \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's something about you that doesn't change.\" \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice less impersonal, \"for your sake.\" She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect that he was even more closely involved than that. \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the subject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the risk of getting a bad one?\" \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty of foliage.\" \"How—long will it last you?\" \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be expensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then it was tough on me too, wasn't it?\" \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why are you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should know him better than most. \"Ask your husband.\" The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate, snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name, and stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call"}

{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_8#0", "contents": "\"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you cannot play.\" \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes. \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\" \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz shrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\" The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This game is really clean.\" \"In a town like this?\" \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung with him. \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by no means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don't you try another town where they're not so particular?\" The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game. He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration. And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him? Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original casing had? He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl, seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of information."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_9#0", "contents": "The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they detached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it happens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good health.\" The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured aloud. \"A criminal then.\" The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive. \"Male?\" \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or biological impossibility, no one could tell. It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever been proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body, Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was, \"Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.\" \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take such a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\" \"Thirty thousand credits.\" \"Why, that's three times the usual rate!\" \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\" \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do."}
{"chunk_id": "Bodyguard_10#0", "contents": "He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body; tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful student of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily, nor whom the police intended to capture easily. This might be a lucky break for me after all , the new tenant thought, as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious rude health, was not a very comfortable fit. I can do a lot with a hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe I'll be able to get away with it. IV \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you too well. And I know you have that man's—the real Gabriel Lockard's—body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror. Lockard—Lockard's body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven chin. \"That what he tell you?\" \"No, he didn't tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to see his body spoiled.\" \"It is a pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved at having someone with whom to share his secret. \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking at him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing. Gabe, why don't you...?\" \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly. \"You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be his wife then. That would be nice—a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little more than you deserve?\" \"I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for she hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I'd go with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ... old body back.\" Sure , she thought, I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and thrill-mills.

Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he looked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed. \"Christ, anything would be better than that!

Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house two miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to admit he was sick that way—in the head! Of course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were moments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his mind. And sometimes—like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching the first hint of light touch the windows—he began sweating with fear. A horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was based on nothing. The chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were chores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except that now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only a vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields remain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to waste.... Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing stronger each day from helping out after school. He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\" She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\" \"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part of a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children. He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her eyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\" \"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he remembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon. Rationed.\" She was fully awake now. \"If you'd only go see Dr. Hamming, Harry. Just for a checkup. Or let me call him so he could—\" \"You stop that! You stop that right now, and for good! I don't want to hear no more about doctors. I get laid up, I'll call one. And it won't be that Hamming who I ain't never seen in my life! It'll be Timkins, who took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\" She began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They had no son, never had a son. And Timkins—he'd died and they'd gone to his funeral. Or so Edna said. He himself just couldn't remember it. He went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a dream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last night, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all the new regulations and not working regular.

Man can't even butcher his own stock for his own table!\" \"We're having meat for lunch,\" she said placatingly. \"Nice cut of multi-pro.\" \"Multi-pro,\" he scoffed. \"God knows what's in it. Like spam put through a grinder a hundred times and then baked into slabs. Can't hardly taste any meat there.\" \"Well, we got no choice. Country's on emergency rations. The current crisis, you know.\" The way she said it irritated him. Like it was Scripture; like no one could question one word of it without being damned to Hell. He finished quickly and without speaking went on out to the barn. He milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and still was done inside of two hours. Then he walked slowly, head down, across the hay-strewn floor. He stopped, put out his hand as if to find a pole or beam that was too familiar to require raising his eyes, and almost fell as he leaned in that direction. Regaining his balance after a sideward staggering shuffle, he looked around, startled. \"Why, this ain't the way I had my barn....\" He heard his own voice, and stopped. He fought the flash of senseless panic. Of course this was the way he'd had his barn built, because it was his barn! He rubbed his hard hands together and said aloud, \"Get down to the patch. Them tomatoes need fertilizer for tang.\" He walked outside and took a deep breath. Air was different, wasn't it? Sweet and pure and clean, like country air always was and always would be; but still, different somehow. Maybe sharper. Or was sharp the word? Maybe.... He went quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen—he'd had twelve pigs, hadn't he? Now he had four—behind the house to where the half-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. Sometime later, Edna called to him. \"Delivery last night, Harry. I took some. Pick up rest?\" \"Yes,\" he shouted. She disappeared. He walked slowly back to the house. As he came into the front yard, moving toward the road and the supply bin, something occurred to him. The car. He hadn't seen the old Chevvy in ... how long? It'd be nice to take a ride to town, see a movie, maybe have a few beers. No. It was against the travel regulations. He couldn't go further than Walt and Gloria Shanks' place. They couldn't go further than his. And the gas rationing. Besides, he'd sold the car, hadn't he? Because it was no use to him lying in the tractor shed."}

{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_3#0", "contents": "He whirled, staring out across the fields to his left. Why, the tractor shed had stood just fifty feet from the house! No, he'd torn it down. The tractor was in town, being overhauled and all. He was leaving it there until he had use for it. He went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. Why should a man his age, hardly sick at all since he was a kid, suddenly start losing hold this way? Edna was worried. The Shanks had noticed it too. He was at the supply bin—like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with a sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines and other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and they left it—or whatever they allowed you—with a bill. You paid the bill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt and your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some money from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn. It came out just about even. He hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had ordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit Medicine Shelf. He carried it into the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. A television program guide. Edna hustled over excitedly. \"Anything good on this week, Harry?\" He looked down the listings, and frowned. \"All old movies. Still only one channel. Still only from nine to eleven at night.\" He gave it to her, turned away; then stopped and waited. He'd said the same thing last week. And she had said the films were all new to her. She said it now. \"Why Harry, I've never seen this movie with Clark Gable. Nor the comedy with Red Skeleton. Nor the other five neither.\" \"I'm gonna lie down,\" he said flatly. He turned and stepped forward, and found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the stove. \"But the door....\" he began. He cut himself short. He turned and saw the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He went there and out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren't right) and into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The bed was wrong. The windows were wrong. The world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world was wrong!"}
{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_4#0", "contents": "Edna didn't wake him, so they had a late lunch. Then he went back to the barn and let the four cows and four sheep and two horses into the pastures. Then he checked to see that Edna had fed the chickens right. They had only a dozen or so now. When had he sold the rest? And when had he sold his other livestock? Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease? He stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face that had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and lean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and went to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to regulations—one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water twice a week. She was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be showing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our livestock, Edna?\" \"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\" He remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went upstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them, and all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was glad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs. He washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were sitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd gotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply bin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the book of directions.\" Harry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked about TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\" \"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book next week.\" \"She's five already?\" Harry asked. \"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that the child should be five years nine months old before embarking on kindergarten book.\" \"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting high....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because he couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing and rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\""}
{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_5#0", "contents": "They ate in the kitchen. They talked—or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt did. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing. Walt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the door and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about Doctor Hamming. He was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying. \"Harry, please see the doctor.\" He got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\" \"But why, Harry, why?\" He couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet cheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\" \"If you say so, Harry.\" He left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He looked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a bright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road was empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over from their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty. Once there'd been cars, people.... He had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't help him. He had to go somewhere, see someone. He went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But he'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he? He threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of wash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find that either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved out of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town. Then he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be reported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't know what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine. He cut into an unfenced, unplanted field. His headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire head throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's mane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved forward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to leave his headache and confusion behind. He didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He raised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off to the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached the gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton Farm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his head, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north. He'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he was leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers. Who was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But anything like"}

{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_6#0", "contents": "Well, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He opened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and rode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after the Pangborns the biggest farm in the county—old Wallace Elverton's place. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed as if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get along without crops for years more. He looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure why, but ... everything was wrong. His head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went sedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another fence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by three feet of barbed-wire—five separate strands. What in the world had Sam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this? He looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way. He found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but fence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back. Yes, there was a slight inward curve. He dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured the best way to get to the other side. The best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they used to say back when he was a kid. It took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got over and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed beneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand. He'd never seen the like of it in this county. He walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He listened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure he was heading in the right direction. And the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring. Flooring! He knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and glanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a sick laugh, so he stopped it. He took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked. More wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound growing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had before in Cultwait County."}
{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_7#0", "contents": "His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to a waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat. He looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under the night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the moon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray. He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised damp fingers to his mouth. Salt. He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly, until he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him, and shut his eyes and mind to everything. Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came down on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to her, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they were which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing him again. It was getting light. His head was splitting. Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in town.... Town! He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east, to the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him right down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find out what was happening. He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until she broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs. Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately—a long time lately? The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by flooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where there could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where that ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons. And after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of Crossville. And after that.... He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here he was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could it be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to forget things he'd known all his life? He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was beyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on the road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard. There'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his family and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks heard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his voice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get you!\""}

A moment later, adult voices yelled after him: \"You theah! Stop!\" \"Call the sheriff! He's headin' foah Piney Woods!\" There was no place called Piney Woods in this county. Was this how a man's mind went? He came to another house, and another. He passed ten all told, and people shouted at him for breaking regulations, and the last three or four sounded like Easterners. And their houses looked like pictures of New England he'd seen in magazines. He rode on. He never did come to town. He came to a ten-foot fence with a three-foot barbed-wire extension. He got off Plum and ripped his clothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood, and came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming in bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth sway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and shook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and went back to the fence and heard a sound. It was a familiar sound, yet strange too. He shaded his eyes against the climbing sun. Then he saw it—a car. A car!"}
{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_9#0", "contents": "It was one of those tiny foreign jobs that run on practically no gas at all. It stopped beside him and two men got out. Young men with lined, tired faces; they wore policemen's uniforms. \"You broke regulations, Mr. Burr. You'll have to come with us.\" He nodded. He wanted to. He wanted to be taken care of. He turned toward Plum. The other officer was walking around the horse. \"Rode her hard,\" he said, and he sounded real worried. \"Shouldn't have done that, Mr. Burr. We have so very few now....\" The officer holding Harry's arm said, \"Pete.\" The officer examining Plum said, \"It won't make any difference in a while.\" Harry looked at both of them, and felt sharp, personal fear. \"Take the horse back to his farm,\" the officer holding Harry said. He opened the door of the little car and pushed Harry inside. He went around to the driver's side and got behind the wheel and drove away. Harry looked back. Pete was leading Plum after them; not riding him, walking him. \"He sure must like horses,\" he said. \"Yes.\" \"Am I going to jail?\" \"No.\" \"Where then?\" \"The doctor's place.\" They stopped in front of the new house two miles past Dugan's farm. Except he'd never seen it before. Or had he? Everyone seemed to know about it—or was everyone only Edna and the Shanks? He got out of the car. The officer took his arm and led him up the path. Harry noticed that the new house was big. When they came inside, he knew it wasn't like any house he'd ever seen or heard of. There was this long central passageway, and dozens of doors branched off it on both sides, and stairways went down from it in at least three places that he could see, and at the far end—a good two hundred yards away—a big ramp led upward. And it was all gray plaster walls and dull black floors and cold white lighting, like a hospital, or a modern factory, or maybe a government building. Except that he didn't see or hear people. He did hear something ; a low, rumbling noise. The further they came along the hall, the louder the rumbling grew. It seemed to be deep down somewhere."}
{"chunk_id": "BREAKDOWN_10#0", "contents": "They went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless room. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there, putting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred years old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked. \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\" The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected one or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or sudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\" \"No violence, Dad.\" \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little treatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\" \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain again. Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\" He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with the big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let them lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his scalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he would let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so as to know whether or not he was insane. \"What happened to my son Davie?\" The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the insides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch. \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\" The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the switch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so many millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone knew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps the whole world is dead—except for us.\" Harry stared at him."}

I should have helped her as I'm helping you.\" \"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and where are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\" \"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run a world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but how large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The people calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me more money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone else, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to reach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have known they would.\" Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines? \"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in the rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because I lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the catastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to survive.\" He laughed, high and thin. His son said, \"Please, Dad....\" \"No! I want to talk to someone sane ! You and Petey and I—we're all insane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land, any land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded by people who are sane only because I made sure they would know nothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand? I went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most were farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway. Because farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later. I put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of the country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave you back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we don't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big crops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all, sanity ! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace and consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\" He choked and stopped. Stan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and his brain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines and remembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered to check south and east; on all sides if that fence continued to curve inward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa. And this wasn't Iowa.

What do you call these treatments?\" \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered. Harry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in change. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said. The doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive you home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\" Harry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations and rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\" \"You will, Mr. Burr.\" Harry walked to the door. \"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said. Harry turned around, smiling. \"What?\" \"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\" Harry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been worried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought maybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations. \"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations?

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He knew the city was organized for his individual defense, for it had been that way since he was born. But who was his enemy? In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was known as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was known as smog. By 2349, it was fog again. But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it. Somewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning. He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the cracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks; what remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he peered was fire-proof. But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke in from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while the soldiers went out to fight. And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt almost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in that grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, \"The soldiers don't want little boys. The soldiers don't want little boys. The soldiers don't—\" \"I'm not a little boy!\" Roddie suddenly shouted. \"I'm full-grown and I've never even seen an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?\" Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder. She rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject. \"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse—\" she chanted. Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that had helped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped the kindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse. \"Wuzzums hungry?\" Molly cooed, still rocking. Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck. It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had cared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a mechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_2#0", "contents": "He was still tinkering when the soldiers came in. While they lined up along the wall, he put Molly's head back on her neck. She gaped coyly at the new arrivals. \"Hello, boys,\" she simpered. \"Looking for a good time?\" Roddie slapped her to silence, reflecting briefly that there were many things he didn't know about Molly. But there was work to be done. Carefully he framed the ritual words she'd taught him: \"Soldiers, come to attention and report!\" There were eleven of them, six feet tall, with four limbs and eight extremities. They stood uniformly, the thumbs on each pair of hands touching along the center line of the legs, front feet turned out at an angle of forty-five degrees, rear feet turned inward at thirty degrees. \"Sir,\" they chorused, \"we have met the enemy and he is ours.\" He inspected them. All were scratched and dented, but one in particular seemed badly damaged. His left arm was almost severed at the shoulder. \"Come here, fellow,\" Roddie said. \"Let's see if I can fix that.\" The soldier took a step forward, lurched suddenly, stopped, and whipped out a bayonet. \"Death to Invaders!\" he yelled, and charged crazily. Molly stepped in front of him. \"You aren't being very nice to my baby,\" she murmured, and thrust her knitting needles into his eyes. Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft spot on his conical skull. The soldier collapsed to the floor."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_3#0", "contents": "Roddie salvaged and returned Molly's needles. Then he examined the patient, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock. It was lucky he did. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off the floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached at the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught and could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another harmlessly. Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another casualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. By the time Roddie had hauled him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie swore, then decided to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces of the other to make a whole one. To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was new at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the soldiers melt away, gradually succumbing to battle damage, shamed him to see the empty ruins burn section by section as the Invaders repeatedly broke through and had to be burned out. Soon there would be nothing left of the Private Property Keep Out that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to them when driven away by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers themselves would be gone. None would remain to guard the city but a few strayed servants like Molly, and an occasional Civil Defender. And himself, Roddie reflected, spitting savagely into the fire. He might remain. But how he fitted into the picture, he didn't know. And Molly, who claimed to have found him in the ruins after a fight with Invaders twenty years before, couldn't or wouldn't say. Well, for as long as possible, Roddie decided, he'd do his duty as the others did theirs—single-mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might accept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first aid was useful to them. He gave the fire a final poke and then paused, wondering if, when heated, his screwdriver could make an unfastened end of wire stick on the grayish spot where it seemed to belong. Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his new idea, Roddie got too close to the flames. Instantly the room filled with the stench of singed hair. Roddie drew angrily back, beating out the sparks in his uncut blond mane. As he stood slapping his head and muttering, a deranged Civil Defense firefighter popped into the doorway and covered him with carbon dioxide foam. Roddie fled. His life-long friends were not merely wearing out, they were unbearably wearing."}

And here in the cold of this fog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble, the diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His cherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the diaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from a string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood irresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more familiar bedlam. But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was, though she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger, thirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his friends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were things of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring eyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide. Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite complete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light on the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off, an owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and rustle as they scampered. The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as an irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even in the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the One who'd built him must have been an apprentice. For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now walked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of how much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock itself a difference to be hidden. His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A weathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was the levering key that opened its door. Everything was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of course that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to move the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for ventilation. But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry out every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all obstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against everything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even him out when he was aflame.... Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling. He lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the street, and felt with his feet for the top rung. Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but saw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could have entered through the iron cover? He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom. It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body heat, as if a large"}

{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_5#0", "contents": "Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready for an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the darkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over that curving surface for identifying features. While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly seized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage kick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an unexpected voice. \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think you are?\" Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to fumble for it. \"Who do you think you are?\" \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls are there in this raiding party?\" His first Invader—and he had dropped his weapon! Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused suddenly. This girl—whatever that was—seemed to think him one of her own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn delay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he killed her. That would make the soldiers accept him! He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would I know how many girls there are?\" Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either. Roddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\" Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight with fear of discovery. If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then. They shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't it, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't have to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\" \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and rising. \"How did you get in?\" \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the dust and they led me here. Where were you?\" \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man when I came back?\" \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these androids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\" Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find him whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him now to redeem himself...."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_6#0", "contents": "\"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said. The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see me soon enough.\" But she'd see him , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast. \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked. \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the Gate, I guess—you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll think it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it over from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\" Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even her own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there were a way over the bridge.... \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\" \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I—I don't want to be alone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\" Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed her— if nothing happened when she saw him. Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand. A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first up the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old thing?\" \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The ladder's right behind me.\" He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn. She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her shapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet that were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number. Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that would make things easy when the time came. He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a full mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he looked too long. Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of fear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst into sudden laughter. \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big, strong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and carrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable character I have ever known!\" He'd passed inspection, then—so far. He expelled his withheld breath, and said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\" \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't say odd.\""}

{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_7#0", "contents": "When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an Invader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner. Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable. For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do any good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most direct route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and she began to talk. Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless to him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had been. \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many casualties.... \"But why do you—we—keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the soldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and they can't leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll be plenty of young men.\" \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever tell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep us out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our tools and things?\" She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance. But she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder every few steps, and if he edged away, she followed. He went on with his questioning. \"Why are you here? I mean, sure, the others are after tools and things, but what's your purpose?\" Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said, \"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no weapon.\" She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of words. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored and hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the boats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was being silly?\" \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\" In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they could see the beginning of the bridge approach. A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and clung to Roddie's arm. \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\" He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back below the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile. \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking."}

Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile. \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking. There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned and walked away. Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie turned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to his. He grimaced and turned away his head. Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from his arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've had no sleep, no food or water.\" Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating needs. \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care of you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\" Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting a pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had grubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose. Picking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed an end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained spinach or squash. \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you happen to know where to find it?\" \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging. \"I've been here before.\" \"Why did the soldier let us go?\" \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\" But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She was silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can with rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the rubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her strength. And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed plainly that he'd given himself away. But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the supposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as Ida herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would satisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he might join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this enemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect him.

He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of his watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder at every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for this self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_8#0", "contents": "He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to look as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked girders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground. Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads made a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest. Roddie stopped, and seized her arm. \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded. \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you belong!\" \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I belong here!\" Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her. She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and out among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they thrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp. Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable anchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling support wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was trapped. He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly would, to finish the job.... But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she dashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved steel surface. For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the ever-steepening catenary until—because there were no guard-ropes or handgrips—she simply fell. That would solve his problem. Except it wouldn't be his solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to his friends. He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog that billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along the top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve steepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole. Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when he'd followed. But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would admit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at every downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_9#0", "contents": "She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced by the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in sight. Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier had ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left the city, were not built to do so. But he was here; with luck, he could capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long. \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\" There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened wire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on. Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted. Never had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar non-mechanical construction. Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling as that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling body of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead. He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog thinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last hundred feet to sanctuary. They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within the tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and slept for several hours."}
{"chunk_id": "Bridge_Crossing_10#0", "contents": "Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings they looked out on a strange and isolated world. To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount Tamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy white sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most forbidding. But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold—of all the kinds of gold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small portion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed to have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its color. Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no interest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes, Roddie saw his duty made suddenly clear. Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which Invaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins of the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable over the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was the advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on the water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need to kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge. Roddie took the hammer from his waist. \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her face with scratched and bloodied hands. Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and, weeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories. \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will come back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\" \"But—but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so senseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your friends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men—and the city is ours, not theirs!\" \"It can't be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those who are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to me. Each of us has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be aimless. Each of us helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and end it by destroying it. My people must be the true Men, because they're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to let you escape.\" Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him. \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in cold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two? Don't—don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\" She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and"}

It was Roddie's turn to stand and stare. \"Purpose!\" Ida flung at him over her shoulder. \"Logic! Women hear so much of that from men! You're a man, all right! Men always call it logic when they want to destroy! Loyalty to your own sort, kindness, affection—all emotional, aren't they? Not a bit logical. Emotion is for creating, and it's so much more logical to destroy, isn't it?\" She whirled back toward him, advancing as if she wanted to sink her teeth into his throat. \"Go ahead. Get it over with—if you have the courage.\" It was hard for Roddie to look away from that wrath-crimsoned face, but it was even harder to keep staring into the blaze of her eyes. He compromised by gazing out an opening at the gathering dusk. He thought for a long time before he decided to tuck his hammer away. \"It isn't reasonable to kill you now,\" he said. \"Too dark. You can't possibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I feel in the morning.\" Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her. And by morning he knew he was a Man."}
{"chunk_id": "Brightside_Crossing_1#0", "contents": "Brightside Crossing by Alan E. Nourse JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by eight.” Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time without justifying it. Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat down at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still healing. The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re planning to attempt the Brightside.” Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going to make a Brightside Crossing.” “At perihelion?” “Of course. When else?” The grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re not going to make the Crossing.” “Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded. “The name is Claney,” said the stranger. There was a silence. Then: “Claney? Peter Claney?” “That’s right.” Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger gone. “Great balls of fire, man— where have you been hiding? We’ve been trying to contact you for months!” “I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the whole idea.” “Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking. Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His fingers were trembling. Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you want to hear.” “But you’ve got to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the story you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need details . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma? Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make it across where your attempt"}

If you can tell us, we can make it across where your attempt failed—” “You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney. “Of course we want to know. We have to know.” “It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.” “Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.” Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting. It was the planet that whipped us, that and the Sun . They’ll whip you, too, if you try it.” “Never,” said Baron. “Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said."}
{"chunk_id": "Brightside_Crossing_2#0", "contents": "I’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082, I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then I was heartbroken when they just disappeared. I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my blood, sure as death. But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American. He was a major in the Interplanetary Service for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up his commission. He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days, did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later. I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool, the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck, with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind of personality that could take a crew of wild men and make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him. He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury, and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since Venus and what my plans were. “No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?” He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?” I told him one-thirty-five. “That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on you, at any rate. How do you take heat?” “You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.” “No, I mean real heat.” Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.” “That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be dangerous, too.” “What trip?” “Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said. I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?” He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion? What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous heat,"}

Four thousand miles of butcherous heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then, nobody’s got Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.” I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in. That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the surface of the Sun itself. It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned just how hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody would cross it. I wanted to be along."}

The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years before. Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside, of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could hold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent installation with a human crew could survive at either extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival temperatures. Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to 60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around. The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab to make final preparations. Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier. Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside was like. Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed him around like a puppy. It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check and test. We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson. We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models, with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in, and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges. The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?” “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know. “He’ll be joining us. He’s a"}

The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?” “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know. “He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve probably heard of him.” I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil, isn’t he?” “Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the line? We’ll need plenty of both.” “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked. “No. Are you worried?” “Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.” The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list. “Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says we should leave in three days.” Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline of our course. “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But these to the south and west could be active. Seismograph tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface shifting.” Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant surface activity.” The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—” It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the further we got from a solution. We knew there were active volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and localized. But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to Darkside.

We knew there were active volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and localized. But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside millennia ago—but there was CO 2 , and nitrogen, and traces of other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide. The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way we would find out what was happening where was to be there. Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited. He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed, sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness. And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about. Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening, Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was set for an early departure after we got some rest."}
{"chunk_id": "Brightside_Crossing_4#0", "contents": "“And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.” Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?” “Of course.” Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t our big problem right then. Equipment worried us first and route next.” Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you have?” “The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at 770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders if the suits failed somewhere.” “How about the Bugs?” “They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on them too much for protection.” “You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?” “We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.” Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass as he set it down on the tablecloth. “Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?” “Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right. We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m getting to that.” He settled back in his chair and continued."}
{"chunk_id": "Brightside_Crossing_5#0", "contents": "We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of the planet at the hottest it ever gets. The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job was only half done—we would still have to travel another two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship, approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off. That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew that. The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left. “Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point. If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?” McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack and I were planning to change around. We figured he could take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.” The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that, Jack?” Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—” McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does it make any difference?” “I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank Peter along with me. Right?” “Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going to do the advance scouting?” “It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead Bug light as possible.” Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down to the frame and wheels.” McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the advance work. You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?” He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up ahead?” “That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said sharply. “Charts! I’m talking about detail work. We don’t need to worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you can’t see on"}

I’m talking about detail work. We don’t need to worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column. I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws. Then—” “No dice,” the Major broke in. “But why not? We could save ourselves days!” “I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man alone—any time, any place.” McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.” “Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff. We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together. Got that?” McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and we nodded, too. “All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight, let’s go.” It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of the Twilight Lab. I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them, Stone dragged the sledges. Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for the first twenty miles. I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out the track the early research teams had made out into the edge of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to bite. We didn’t feel the heat so much those first days out. We saw it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past,"}

We were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to bite. We didn’t feel the heat so much those first days out. We saw it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace. We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks. The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates, bulk gelatin, vitamins. The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise. We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it happened to be so. We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches, but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers for one ice-cold bottle of beer. After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden. Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge, with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous gases. It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there, so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible. Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered before, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun itself. Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would get us. That was the bargain.

The only worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun itself. Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would get us. That was the bargain. I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods. The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their sides were shrouded with heavy ash. We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot, sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous surface for the Bug’s pillow tires. I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly, at first. Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to think so, too. McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves. He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route now and then, never far, but a little further each time. Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive enough myself; I just managed to hide it better. And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the end of an eight-hour trek. But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves.

He had driven down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we heard a sharp cry through our earphones. I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand horrible pictures racing through our minds.... We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the fiberglass helmets. This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on their Brightside Crossing."}
{"chunk_id": "Brightside_Crossing_6#0", "contents": "On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change. It looked the same, but every now and then it felt different. On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch; I gunned my motor and nothing happened. I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs, thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash. I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous. I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t like it. One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking much about the others. I was worried about me , plenty worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me. It wasn’t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the thought out of my mind. It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond a deep crack. I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved fifty yards to the left, then back to the right. There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing; a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the ledge shift over a few feet."}

Ann whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I think I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\" Jeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.

It read: 4-D TRAVEL BEURO Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even spells it different.\" Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\" \"You mean you come from the future?\" \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\" \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man didn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and force. \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added persuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\" \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision. \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every day. I look damaged?\" As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and his nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff politely agreed that he did not look damaged. Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time travel work?\" \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too complicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not possible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\" Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\" \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know Missing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go with me to other time.

Come on, look at station. Very near here.\" Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if anything.\" Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's madness—a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But we go in my car.\" Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like grace of his short, broad body. \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got some gimmick.\" \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said. \"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's kind of handsome, in a tough way.\" II Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a good neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the whisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm dusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful. Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine metal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a flourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back. \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to Jeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\" \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said. \"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for some daffy religious sect.\" They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader said, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\" The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the next room, after a glance at Snader's key. The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut after them. The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the walls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle of the ceiling and two movie screens—or were they giant television screens?—occupying a whole wall at either end of the room. The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an arrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word Ante , and to the right with the word Post . Jeff studied the big screens.

The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an arrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word Ante , and to the right with the word Post . Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One appeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like a railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left wall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined corridor moved toward him from that direction. \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it for?\" \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\" \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of time, I suppose?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_5#0", "contents": "Instead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed a group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled toward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in the picture waved back. Ann gasped. \"It was just as if they saw us.\" \"They did,\" Snader said. \"No movie. Time travelers. In fourth dimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.\" \"What's he supposed to be?\" Jeff asked as the onrushing picture showed them briefly a figure bound hand and foot, huddled in one of the chairs. He stared at them piteously for an instant before the picture surged past. Snader showed his teeth. \"That was convict from my time. We have criminals, like in your time. But we do not kill. We make them work. Where he going? To end of line. To earliest year this time groove reach. About 600 A.D., your calendar. Authorities pick up when he get there. Put him to work.\" \"What kind of work?\" Jeff asked. \"Building the groove further back.\" \"Sounds like interesting work.\" Snader chortled and slapped him on the back. \"Maybe you see it some day, but forget that now. You come with me. Little trip.\" Jeff was perspiring. This was odder than he expected. Whatever the fakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to know about it. He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\" Snader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\" He moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and disappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water. Jeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his instruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in the far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky figure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds, he was recognizable as Snader—and as the picture brought him forward, he stepped down out of it and was with them again. \"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took other carrier back here.\" \"Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,\" Jeff said. \"How did you do it? Can I do it, too?\" \"I show you.\" Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann and Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. \"Now,\" he said. \"Step in.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_6#0", "contents": "Jeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the screen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or motion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room. In fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the chair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them, they faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a dark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance. The square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like the waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the ceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the dark tunnel again. Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice through the looking-glass.\" \"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered. \"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to figure it out yet.\" Another lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when they had flickered through it, another and then another. \"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long—how many years back are you taking us?\" Snader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to stop.\" For a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years ago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be real, we could see him again.\" \"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember? Would we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would—\" Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was moving through a room numbered 724. \"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\" He took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by a room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it. Again there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a bright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of the room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous club-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream. \"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the number. We haven't been anywhere.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_7#0", "contents": "Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance that was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door. In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past her. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\" He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it behind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house. \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street. The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster, there was now a long black limousine. \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get in.\" He opened the door of the limousine. Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something was happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous. \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody on Earth will pay ransom for us.\" Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom. You in different time now.\" \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled us. We're still in 1957.\" \"You are? Look around.\" Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself that these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even the telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely foreign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had probably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out another house. \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly. Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could see no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside her. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He started the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb, narrowly missing another car. Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\" Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\" Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\" \"What about it?\" \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in. There were bars at the windows.\" \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He glanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And the street—\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner. \"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\" III They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The car zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff knew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957—nor in any earlier year. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the mountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always. \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we escaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\" She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming,"}

Somehow I guess we escaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\" She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a minute ago. But now, oh, boy!\" \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned forward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us into the future instead of the past, didn't you?\" It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he shrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned. Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit back and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\" As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty of big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were. The names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite Channel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him from a fork in the freeway. \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new, but it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift—\" She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up in front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center, ablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize it, in spite of his familiarity with the city. Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a commanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's have some answers before we go any further.\" Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\" The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann. She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as well go in and see what's there.\" Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a corridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door."}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_8#0", "contents": "A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them heartily. \"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this our sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look. \"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name—Jeff Elliott. Fine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann Elliott.\" The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he said to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\" He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out on the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and in it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted a perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes studied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs. Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and moved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann. Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\" \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone. \"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\" The blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's what you mean. What's this about?\" \"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window. Kersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in time. About six years back.\" \"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\" \"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr. Dumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not yet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well understood in your time, are they not?\" \"What's chromatics? Color television?\" \"Exactly. You are an expert in—ah—colored television, I think.\" Jeff nodded. \"So what?\" The old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You will enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\" Jeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_9#0", "contents": "Bullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this! You're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract, but you do what I say!\" \"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily. \"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the way I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your knowledge.\" Kersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate permit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen has taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can make a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you to live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\" Jeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He wondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange streets. But he put on a bold front. \"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work for you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and stop us, legally or any other way.\" Kersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen chuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go on, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here—Butterfly 9, ask for Bullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow pre-noon.\" \"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\" When they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it. For a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\" \"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics—or practical jokers.\" He looked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was no sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_10#0", "contents": "Her hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off their problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows. \"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of neckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they expect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\" \"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann glanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where are we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't even look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are dressed—it's not old-fashioned, just different.\" \"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He pressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter. If the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same jargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff pondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit chills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what clearly were hamburgers—though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas. Jeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\" When the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate in silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them. When they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked at it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two dollar bills. The man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\" \"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile. \"They're just new bills, that's all.\" The cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's no good here,\" he said, and pushed it back. The bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you want? This is all I have.\" The cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one of the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a policeman. He loomed up beside Jeff. \"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their checks, eyed Jeff curiously. \"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got something to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender. Do you know where I can exchange it?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Butterfly_9_11#0", "contents": "The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident interest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of America,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\" \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully. \"I—uh—got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further than I thought. What's the name of this place?\" \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you must come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know about this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak Federal, if you come from so far?\" Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the United States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where they know about foreign exchange?\" The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You got immigrate clearance?\" An angry muttering started among the bystanders. The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\" At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high counter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men whom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to listen. \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or lunate,\" the policeman said as he finished. His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare. Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in something he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I do—more or less—but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong in the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm so far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\" There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation. The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and got answers which probably seemed stupid to him. The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you advertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\" The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his wallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which Jeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave doubt that he had any legal right to be in the country. In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night. Jeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned and alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down in the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he hesitated. In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately he had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the big red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow brought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy. IV He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a little man"}

In the early morning, he looked up to see a little man with a briefcase at his cell door. \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's barmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release, if you are ready to be reasonable.\" Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm ready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\" \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man claiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\" \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen isn't getting me out of here.\" The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday—you've gone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to understand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie film. A film never changes. Space does—and time does. For example, if a movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to find a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\" \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil War was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\" \"If you go back to the time you call 1865—which is most easily done—you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or that war.\" Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\" The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at Sixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day of the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you grasp the difference between the two?\" \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you speak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\" \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space—say, a lake in the mountains—how do you identify that place? By looking for landmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain peak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\" \"So far. Keep talking.\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The man with the handkerchief mask said, \"All right, everybody, keep tight. This is a holdup.\" There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall at his desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger. There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic named Rodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English and Miss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was Mister Anderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There was Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their joint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward (Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars dimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father in the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels, withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three bank robbers. The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they all wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers, brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs over the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled low over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous. The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two calibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of the others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and said to him in a low voice, \"Think about retirement, my friend.\" The third one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked quickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with money. It was just like the movies. The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and the customers all over against the back wall, while the second man stayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed money into the black satchel. The man by the door said, \"Hurry up.\" The man with the satchel said, \"One more drawer.\" The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, \"Keep your shirt on.\" That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ran pelting in her stocking feet for the door."}

But he'd been moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the brass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk. The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did her best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting out the front door and running down the street toward the police station in the next block, shouting, \"Help! Help! Robbery!\" The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came running around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried to keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with the gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the floor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front, in which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine. Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch. Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank, and the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and drove straight down the street toward the police station. The police cars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting like the ships in pirate movies. There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers were going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong way and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear path behind them. Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly started jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And all the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers when they crawled dazedly out of their car. \"Hey,\" said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. \"Hey, that was something, huh, Mom?\" \"Come along home,\" said his mother, grabbing his hand. \"We don't want to be involved.\""}

I suppose they just grabbed whatever was handiest.\" \"What I can't figure out,\" said Stevenson, \"is exactly what made those tires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't that hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fast enough to melt your tires down.\" Pauling shrugged again. \"We got them. That's the important thing.\" \"Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling out Rockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubes blow out and there they are.\" Stevenson shook his head. \"I can't figure it.\" \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,\" suggested Pauling. \"They picked the wrong car to steal.\" \"And that doesn't make sense, either,\" said Stevenson. \"Why steal a car that could be identified as easily as that one?\" \"Why? What was it, a foreign make?\" \"No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like half the cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner had burned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half a block away.\" \"Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car,\" said Pauling. \"For a well-planned operation like this one,\" said Stevenson, \"they made a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense.\" \"What do they have to say about it?\" Pauling demanded. \"Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all.\" The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his head in. \"The owner of that Chevvy's here,\" he said. \"Right,\" said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to the front desk. The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall and paunchy. \"John Hastings,\" he said. \"They say you have my car here.\" \"I believe so, yes,\" said Stevenson. \"I'm afraid it's in pretty bad shape.\" \"So I was told over the phone,\" said Hastings grimly. \"I've contacted my insurance company.\" \"Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come with me?\""}

Why not?\" \"The car was stolen,\" Stevenson reminded him. Hastings grumbled and glared. \"It's always been perfectly safe up till now.\" \"Yes, sir. In here.\" Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. \"It's ruined!\" he cried. \"What did you do to the tires?\" \"Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.\" Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. \"Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What did you use, incendiary bullets?\" Stevenson shook his head. \"No, sir. When that happened they were two blocks away from the nearest policeman.\" \"Hmph.\" Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim, \"What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of kids had stolen the car.\" \"It wasn't a bunch of kids,\" Stevenson told him. \"It was four professional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in a bank holdup.\" \"Then why did they do that ?\" Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the crudely-lettered words, \"The Scorpion\" burned black into the paint of the trunk lid. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"It wasn't there before the car was stolen?\" \"Of course not!\" Stevenson frowned. \"Now, why in the world did they do that?\" \"I suggest,\" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, \"you ask them that.\" Stevenson shook his head. \"It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking about anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.\" He looked at the trunk lid again. \"It's the nuttiest thing,\" he said thoughtfully.... That was on Wednesday. The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the Daily News brought a crank letter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is, the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a newspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address. The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point: Dear Mr. Editor: The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion fights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS! Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket.

Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It didn't rate a line in the paper. II The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man went berserk. It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood, composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins. Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home, brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand. As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom. Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the house at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked bedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and \"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they heard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a man sleep?\" At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence, a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of similar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted from his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being annoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells at them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the hand and shoulder. Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming out the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting, \"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One neighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television stations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards."}

This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a position across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work with a Zoomar lens. In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house, firing at anything that moved. The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One concentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors and ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to search for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home audience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and undershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the house. The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere, and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the corner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr. Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The police used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they had the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway. Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge anyone present to hand-to-hand combat. The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day and all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken. Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again. The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and dramatically. Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of shooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and threw the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered down to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell barrel first onto the lawn. Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a wounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall into the arms of the waiting police. They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually trying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was shouting: \"My hands! My hands!\" They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers were red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was another burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder. Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn ointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The neighbors went home and telephoned their friends. On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the precincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson.

Among them was Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy individual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle. He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all. He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the stock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, \"The Scorpion.\""}
{"chunk_id": "CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_6#0", "contents": "You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political connections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As Captain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both more imaginative than most—\"You gotta be able to second-guess the smart boys\"—and to be a complete realist—\"You gotta have both feet on the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was best not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks. The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore. \"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded. \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things. First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for no reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk. Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle all of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to prove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\" \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain. Stevenson shook his head. \"His lawyer says he put it on there. Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's case. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\" \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary patience. \"What are you trying to prove?\" \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And what about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\" \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly. \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the trunk?\" \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car was stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows? What do they say?\" \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never saw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been there.\" The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are you trying to prove?\" \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I guess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made that rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\" \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are you trying to hand me?\" \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\" \"And all I know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on his rifle himself. He says so.\" \"And what made it so hot?\" \"Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do you think made it hot?\" \"All of a sudden?\" \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\" \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked desperately. \"How should I know?

It happens all the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\" \"But there's no explanation—\" started Stevenson. \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just gave you the explanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty idea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there was a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned refrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting all upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch. Remember?\" \"I remember,\" said Stevenson. \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him. \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.... The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a crank letter to the Daily News : Dear Mr. Editor, You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could not escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is safe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS. Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the same place, and forgotten. III Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around for the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up carrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on your way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a JD. The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances on two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and the street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides claimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys from both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that had been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and determined that the matter could only be settled in a war. The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard. The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both entrances. The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate clubrooms for last-minute instructions.

The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both entrances. The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate clubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play chicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of the approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might come wandering through. Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen years old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine, gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the Scarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to her. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street. Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were dark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark, particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone pole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet Raider jacket and waited. At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The rumble had started. At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the street. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them carried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks on. They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey, you kids. Take off.\" One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\" \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\" \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask. \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\""}
{"chunk_id": "CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_7#0", "contents": "\"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long way to go to get home.\" \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\" \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down that street.\" \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete and elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt and a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a black knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down there?\" this apparition demanded. \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here. Take off.\" \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're fighting down there!\" \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be involved.\" \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went running around Judy and dashing off down the street. \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\" Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase the one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would come running along after her. She didn't know what to do. A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems. \"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\" \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the schoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\" But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the schoolyard. The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving their arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling off their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering. They were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's warning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both schoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy and the rumble was over. Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great big blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in the yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street. And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault."}
{"chunk_id": "CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_8#0", "contents": "Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was impatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've got a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing of yours again.\" \"I'm afraid it is, Captain,\" said Stevenson. \"Did you see the morning paper?\" \"So what?\" \"Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?\" Captain Hanks sighed. \"Stevenson,\" he said wearily, \"are you going to try to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's the problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\" \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told him. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the Challengers.\" \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks. \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\" \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\" \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted that much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever seeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\" \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take their word?\" \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\" \"I glanced through it.\" \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once all the metal they were carrying—knives and tire chains and coins and belt buckles and everything else—got freezing cold, too cold to touch. And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to pull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion.'\" \"Now, let me tell you something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard the police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they threw their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been part of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before they could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed up a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it but weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the neighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not bothering anybody. That's what happened. And all this talk about freezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec punk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to worrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid gangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or you're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business. Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Gold! A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold ... they go hand in hand. Like the horsemen of the Apocalypse. And, of course, there's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get any thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain, sorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great treasure.... These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchis seeking the Fleece. They were true when men sailed the southern oceans in wooden ships. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit. We're still a greedy lot.... I'm a queer one to be saying these things, but then, who has more right? Look at me. My hair is gray and my face ... my face is a mask. The flesh hangs on my bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame. I am old, old. And I wait here on my hospital cot—wait for the weight of years I never lived to drag me under and let me forget the awful things my eyes have seen. I'm poor, too, or else I wouldn't be here in this place of dying for old spacemen. I haven't a dime except for the pittance the Holcomb Foundation calls a spaceman's pension. Yet I had millions in my hands. Treasure beyond your wildest dreams! Cursed treasure.... You smile. You are thinking that I'm just an old man, beached earthside, spinning tall tales to impress the youngsters. Maybe, thinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have the idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value out in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're right about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of civilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of that. We did it for us ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we were, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the risks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there. But there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to all of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no part of the world of men, thick with danger—and horror."}

I suppose you've never heard of the Martian Maid, and so you don't know the story of what happened to her crew or her skipper. I can give you this much of an answer. I was her skipper. And her crew? They ride high in the sky ... dust by this time. And all because they were men, and men are greedy and hasty and full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold. They ride a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their lives. It's all theirs now. Bought and paid for. It wasn't too long ago that I lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on that last flight. Not many of you will remember her class of ship, so many advances have been made in the last few years. The Maid was two hundred feet from tip to tail, and as sleek a spacer as ever came out of the Foundation Yards. Chemical fueled, she was nothing at all like the spherical hyperdrives we see today. She was armed, too. The Foundation still thought of space as a possible stamping ground for alien creatures though no evidence of any extra-terrestrial life had ever been found ... then. My crew was a rough bunch, like all those early crews. I remember them so well. Lean, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for high pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski. There wasn't a man on board who wouldn't have traded his immortal soul for a few solar dollars, and I don't claim that I was any different. That's the kind of men that opened up the spaceways, too. Don't believe all this talk about the noble pioneering spirit of man. That's tripe. There never has been such a thing as a noble pioneer. Not in space or anywhere else. It is the malcontent and the adventuring mercenary that pushes the frontier outward. I didn't know, that night as I stood in the valve of the Maid, watching the loading cranes pull away, that I was starting out on my last flight. I don't think any of the others could have guessed, either. It was the sort of night that you only see on Mars. The sort of night that makes a spaceman wonder why in hell he wants to leave the relative security of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle to go jetting across the belt into deep space and the drab desolation of the outer System. I stood there, watching the lights of Canalopolis in the distance. For just a moment I was ... well, touched. It looked beautiful and unreal under the racing moons. The lights of the gin mills and houses made a sparkling filigree pattern on the dark waters of the ancient canal, and the moons cast their shifting shadows across the silted banks. I was too far away to see the space-fevered bums and smell the shanties, and for a little while I felt the wonder"}

I was too far away to see the space-fevered bums and smell the shanties, and for a little while I felt the wonder of standing on the soil of a world that man had made his own with his rapacity and his sheer guts and gimme. I thought of our half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload we would pick up on Callisto. And I counted the extra cash my packets of snow would bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of the outer Systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid that the Holcomb Foundation snoopers never heard about, you can be sure of that. In those days the asteroid belt was the primary danger and menace to astrogation. For a long while it held men back from deep space, but as fuels improved a few ships were sent out over the top. A few million miles up out of the ecliptic plane brings you to a region of space that's pretty thinly strewn with asteroids, and that's the way we used to make the flight between the outer systems and the EMV Triangle. It took a long while for hyperdrives to be developed and of course atomics never panned out because of the weight problem. So that's the orbit the Maid took on that last trip of mine. High and clear into the supra-solar void. And out there in that primeval blackness is where we found the derelict."}
{"chunk_id": "CAPTAIN_MIDAS_3#0", "contents": "I didn't realize it was a derelict when Spinelli first reported it from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation ship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of developing spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole responsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never in history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just assumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of unreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct. There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that Spinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one of us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All this before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk! All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope I saw that there was something different about this one. At such a distance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass, but I could see that the hulk was big—bigger than any ship I'd ever seen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my slide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the derelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something about its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer, and showed him my figures. \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to you?\" Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures. It didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct, Captain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of those figures on the chart. \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered. The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug of the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon they were assembled in Control. \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have computed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems to be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into the book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's Space Regulations and opened it to the section concerning salvage. \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary Astrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found in an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space not subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars Triangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the vessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases as the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily ascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that means that if that thing"}

Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The first impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon every man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be worth money ... lots of money. Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\" They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth plenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me. \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply. \"Certainly!\""}
{"chunk_id": "CAPTAIN_MIDAS_4#0", "contents": "The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was her size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained such gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand feet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable alienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully in the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with something like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff were somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some strange and alien way. It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for inter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of mystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave her birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was unthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she was drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung about Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away again into the inter-stellar deeps. Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps yesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip that bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We would never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond the ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know what killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she was mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ... but of what? We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would have meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better equipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by men. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank. Let the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and brought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things figured. The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed by the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared a boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth millions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and crossed to her. In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their faces. \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit her tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives. She's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage compartments that are still unbroken.\" She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was nothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from.

Nothing left but the hull and a few storage compartments that are still unbroken.\" She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was nothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull alone was left. He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples of her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this stuff....\" \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The carcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and Zaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her down under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check those compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When it's done report to me in my quarters.\" I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a metallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff is worth anything....\" The metal was heavy—too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship construction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that distant world where this metal was made? Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal torn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver; those strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were there too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of the metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand. It had a yellowish tinge, and it was heavier .... Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held it grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm. Suddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It struck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of metallic lustre. For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying all the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a balance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It was no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The whorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing vibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had drawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal—the stuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was built—was now.... Gold! I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my table-top. Gold! I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps, from some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ... drawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability in its new environment. Stability as a terrene element—wonderfully, miraculously gold! And outside,"}

{"chunk_id": "CAPTAIN_MIDAS_5#0", "contents": "A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the doorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black eyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table. He needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me that his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was the meaning of the expression on his heavy face. \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my quarters!\" Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the derelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last two words. I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on the rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous. \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply. \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize crew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\" I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a first class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would need good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me to beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me, Spinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\" Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning slowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat him of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship. \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister Spinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is that clear?\" \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face and there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he turned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like him to let it go at that. Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't functioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I rubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering about Spinelli. Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and after that there was tension in the air. Distrust. For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat to clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first place I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the second place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid. I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and I was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that there was no double-cross. I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the rest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk. That way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to"}

That way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the treasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they were to be handling a vessel practically made of gold. I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with that starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally I had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had set the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict."}
{"chunk_id": "CAPTAIN_MIDAS_6#0", "contents": "Together, Spinelli and I watched the Maid's crew vanish into the maw of the alien ship and get her under way. There was a flicker of bluish fire from her jury-rigged tubes astern, and then she was vanishing in a great arc toward the bright gleam of Jupiter, far below us. The Maid followed under a steady one G of acceleration with most of her controls on automatic. Boats of the Martian Maid's class, you may remember, carried a six inch supersonic projector abaft the astrogation turret. These were nasty weapons for use against organic life only. They would reduce a man to jelly at fifty thousand yards. Let it be said to my credit that it wasn't I who thought of hooking the gun into the radar finder and keeping it aimed dead at the derelict. That was Spinelli's insurance against Zaleski. When I discovered it I felt the rage mount in me. He was willing to blast every one of his shipmates into pulp should the hulk vary from the orbit we'd laid out for her. He wasn't letting anything come between him and that mountain of gold. Then I began thinking about it. Suppose now, just suppose, that Zaleski told the rest of the crew about the gold. It wouldn't be too hard for the derelict to break away from the Maid, and there were plenty of places in the EMV Triangle where a renegade crew with a thousand tons of gold would be welcomed with open arms and no questions asked. Suspicion began to eat at me. Could Zaleski and Cohn have dreamed up a little switch to keep the treasure ship for themselves? It hadn't seemed likely before, but now— The gun-pointer remained as it was. As the days passed and we reached turn-over with the hulk still well within visual range, I noticed a definite decrease in the number of messages from Cohn. The Aldis Lamps no longer blinked back at the Maid eight or ten times a day, and I began to really regret not having taken the time to equip the starship with UHF radio communicators. Each night I slept with a hunk of yellow gold under my bunk, and ridiculously I fondled the stuff and dreamed of all the things I would have when the starship was cut up and sold. My weariness grew. It became almost chronic, and I soon wondered if I hadn't picked up a touch of space-radiation fever. The flesh of my hands seemed paler than it had been. My arms felt heavy. I determined to report myself to the Foundation medics on Callisto. There's no telling what can happen to a man in space.... Two days past turn-over the messages from the derelict came through garbled. Spinelli cursed and said that he couldn't read their signal. Taking the Aldis from him I tried to raise them and failed. Two hours later I was still failing and Spinelli's black eyes glittered with an animal suspicion. \"They're faking!\" \"Like hell they are!\" I snapped irritably, \"Something's gone wrong....\" \"Zaleski's gone"}

You told him about the gold!\" \"Sure I did,\" he sneered. \"Did you expect me to shut up and let you land the ship yourself and claim Captain's share? I found her, and she's mine!\" I fought to control my temper and said: \"Let's see what's going on in her before deciding who gets what, Mister Spinelli.\" Spinelli bit his thick lips and did not reply. His eyes were fixed on the image of the starship on the viewplate. A light blinked erratically within the dark cut of its wounded side. \"Get this down, Spinelli!\" The habit of taking orders was still in him, and he muttered: \"Aye ... sir.\" The light was winking out a message, but feebly, as though the hand that held the lamp were shaking and the mind conceiving the words were failing. \"CONTROL ... LOST ... CAN'T ... NO ... STRENGTH ... LEFT ... SHIP ... WALLS ... ALL ... ALL GOLD ... GOLD ... SOMETHING ... HAPPENING ... CAN'T ... UNDERSTAND ... WHA....\" The light stopped flashing, abruptly, in mid-word. \"What the hell?\" demanded Spinelli thickly. \"Order them to heave to, Mister,\" I ordered. He clicked the Aldis at them. The only response was a wild swerve in the star-ship's course. She left the orbit we had set for her as though the hands that guided her had fallen away from the control. Spinelli dropped the Aldis and rushed to the control panel to make the corrections in the Maid's course that were needed to keep the hulk in sight. \"Those skunks! Double crossing rats!\" he breathed furiously. \"They won't shake loose that easy!\" His hands started down for the firing console of the supersonic rifle. I caught the movement from the corner of my eye. \" Spinelli! \" My shout hung in the still air of the control room as I knocked him away from the panel. \"Get to your quarters!\" I cracked. He didn't say a thing, but his big shoulders hunched angrily and he moved across the deck toward me, his hands opening and closing spasmodically. His eyes were wild with rage and avarice. \"You'll hang for mutiny, Spinelli!\" I said."}

He stumbled against the bulkhead and his eyes were glazed. He charged again, roaring. I stepped aside and smashed him in the mouth with my right fist, then crossing with an open-handed left to the throat. He staggered, spun and came for me again. I sank a hard left into his stomach and nailed him on the point of the jaw with a right from my shoe-tops. He straightened up and sprawled heavily to the deck, still trying to get at me. I aimed a hard kick at his temple and let it go. My metal shod boot caught him squarely and he rolled over on his face and lay still. I nailed him with a right from my shoe-tops. Breathing heavily, I rolled him back face up. His eyes were open, glassy with an implacable hate. I knelt at his side and listened for his breathing. There was none. I knew then that I had killed him. I felt sick inside, and dizzy. I wasn't myself as I turned away from Spinelli's body there on the steel deck. Some of the greed died out of me, and my exertions had increased my sense of fatigue to an almost numbing weariness. My arms ached terribly and my hands felt as though they had been sucked dry of their substance. Like a man in a nightmare, I held them up before my face and looked at them. They were wrinkled and grey, with the veins standing out a sickly purple. And I could see that my arms were taking on that same aged look. I was suddenly fully aware of my fear. Nothing fought against the flood of terror that welled through me. I was terrified of that yellow gold in my cabin, and of that ship of devil's metal out there in space that held my shipmates. There was something unnatural about that contra-terrene thing ... something obscene. I located the hulk in the radar finder and swung the Maid after it, piling on acceleration until my vision flickered. We caught her, the Maid and I. But we couldn't stop her short of using the rifle on her, and I couldn't bring myself to add to my depravity by killing the rest of my men. It would have been better if I had! I laid the Maid alongside the thousand foot hull of the derelict and set the controls on automatic. It was dangerous, but I was beyond caring.

As I approached the airlock of the compartment set aside as living quarters for the prize crew, the saffron of the walls deepened. Crazy little thoughts began spinning around in my brain. Words out of the distant past loomed up with a new and suddenly terrifying perspective ... alchemy ... transmutation ... energy. I'm a spaceman, not a scientist. But in those moments I think I was discovering what had happened to my crew and why the walls were turning into yellow metal. The lock was closed, but I swung it open and let the pressure in the chamber rise. I couldn't wait for it to reach fourteen pounds ... at eleven, I swung the inner door and stumbled eagerly through. The brilliant light, reflected from gleaming walls blinded me for a moment. And then I saw them! They huddled, almost naked in a corner, skeletal things with skull-like faces that leered at me with the vacuous obscenity of old age. Even their voices were raw and cracked with the rusty decay of years. They babbled stupidly, caressing the walls with claw-like hands. They were old, old! I understood then. I knew what my wrinkled aged hands meant. That devil-metal from beyond the stars had drawn the energy it needed from ... us ! My laughter was a crazy shriek inside my helmet. I looked wildly at the gleaming walls that had sucked the youth and strength from these men. The walls were stable, at rest. They were purest gold ... gold ... gold! I ran from that place still screaming with the horror of it. My hands burned like fire! Age was in them, creeping like molten lead through my veins, ghastly and sure....

It belongs to them now ... all of it. But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty! I'm thirty two.

The First Vice-President was a cool cat—the elevator and the money operators all wore earmuffs—was just as phony as a three-dollar bill! [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I The First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company, the gentleman to whom Miss Orison McCall was applying for a job, was not at all the public picture of a banker. His suit of hound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his jacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious bank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really swing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you come on real cool in the secretary-bit.\" \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from staring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of furry green earmuffs. It was not cold. Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color bread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked. \"Beg pardon?\" \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and down on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots. \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said. \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught Orison's look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he explained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work in a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's a hunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\" \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed. \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with athletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell you, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around this tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of elevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly to Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal than Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\" Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison, \"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor and floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron Curtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said.

The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to hold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and a microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket. \"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked. The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket. \"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you get done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to read. Okay?\" \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a secretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me with the Bank's operation?\" \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that there paper into this here microphone. Can do?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to ask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union, coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take care of these details now? Or would you—\" \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems best to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's might explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's secretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall, girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket, unfolded it to discover the day's Wall Street Journal , and began at the top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk, nodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said. \"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\" Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the one into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then took off upstairs in the elevator."}
{"chunk_id": "CINDERELLA_STORY_2#0", "contents": "By lunchtime Orison had finished the Wall Street Journal and had begun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a fantastic novel of some sort, named The Hobbit . Reading this peculiar fare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than ever that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her, the front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a Federal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a microphone for an invisible audience. Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the book and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was a new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming down from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with briefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these gentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped aboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment of their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny into this curiousest of banks. Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude. Girls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together, eyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and favored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed, finished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her lonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book, reading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her light coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed, silent, hat-clasping gentlemen. What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a double Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of the U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association. Earmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President with the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those upper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment house—the Windsor Arms—and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her boss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft Bank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought. She was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker. Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day's observations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for her initial report.

{"chunk_id": "CINDERELLA_STORY_3#0", "contents": "In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven o'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results of her first day's spying. No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock was set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her? Perhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs had her phone tapped. \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered. Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she said. \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one. Do you read me? Over.\" Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax, she reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it. The room was empty. \"Testing,\" the voice repeated. \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience. Who are you?\" \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you have anything to report, Miss McCall?\" \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded. \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly to your pillow, Miss McCall.\" Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow. \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow beside her. Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she asked. \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications security. Have you anything to report?\" \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the time?\" \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we establish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time, every day?\" \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said. \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said. \"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\" Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a microphone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said. \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped into a real snakepit, beautiful.\" \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked. \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with a peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she placed the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone. Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved to write Washington for permission to make her future reports by registered mail. II At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current Wall Street Journal , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair of leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together was bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not wearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding.

I am President of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our little family.\" \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight? So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three? Maybe higher heels? \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took the chair to the right of her desk. \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone. \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said. \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any reasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said. \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled, as though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official designation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're to keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here and dictate it?\" \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and presence, was obviously as kookie as his bank. \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding asked, as though following her train of thought. \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large financial organization.\" \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used to them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense with calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy your using it.\" \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\" \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this evening?\" Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and still so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said. \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\" \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march, playing, from the elevator. \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your personnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle, and bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European. Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a curtsy? Orison wondered. \"Thank you,\" she said. He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome, to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink, saw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but not their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them. Small bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding."}

A page came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of yesterday's Congressional Record . She launched into the Record , thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome madman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read so well , darling,\" someone said across the desk. Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn't hear you come up.\" \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front of the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison thought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't like her. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats. \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing teeth. \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm Auga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\" \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\" \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to visit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker. One for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\" \"Thanks,\" Orison said. \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to draw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding—you know, the shoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should you throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little eyes scratched out. Word to the wise, n'est-ce pas ?\" \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her Wall Street Journal into a club and standing. \"Darling.\" \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here. You could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of annoyance. Understand me, darling?\" \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to your stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\" \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right off?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator, displaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba motion. The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male, stepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing. \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed, he stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said. \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused and shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ... Vingt thing....\" \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said. \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\" \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding, Dink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped even closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch of frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The head, Orison"}

The head, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's spike-topped Pickelhauben ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed normal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed—what continental manners these bankers had!—and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up paper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it."}
{"chunk_id": "CINDERELLA_STORY_5#0", "contents": "Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and said, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you, Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing business with pleasure.\" Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she shouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I care. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in finance, and listen to another word.\" \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again, a bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most charming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end, dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to the wise....\" \" N'est-ce pas? \" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the foolish. Get lost.\" Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\" \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind you. Push a button, will you? And bon voyage .\" Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with a cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above fifth floor. First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding. Surely, Orison thought, recovering the Wall Street Journal from her wastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern bank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior of the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she thought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks and all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she finished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits upper floors. Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the sudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \" Wanji e-Kal, Datto. Dink ger-Dink d'summa. \" Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before replying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\" \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda clutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see him, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\" \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down. What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language Mr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by tonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle it out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk, she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could only fire her.

Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would be here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going. The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her off the upstairs floors. But the building had a stairway. III The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to seven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and the landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There was a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the fringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound. She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened. Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut, its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were galvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs. Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred and eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half full of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment Orison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the liquid. Then she screamed. The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from the spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions upon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling, leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison put her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the stairway door. Into a pair of arms. \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said. Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have her wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder Gerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he said. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were we to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against her two sumo -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by some quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the floor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted all around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of course, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of calcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within minutes.\" \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of the earmuffed sumo -wrestlers protested. \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you must tell me what you were doing here, or I'll"}

Dink!\" Orison shouted. \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of damsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the bank.\" \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you acromegalic apes!\" \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded. \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\""}

Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as though struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their faces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering himself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without questions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms around Orison. \"They can't harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against his chest. \"You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn your brain back on. All right, now?\" \"All right,\" she said, still trembling. \"They were going to throw me to the spiders.\" \"Kraft told you that?\" Dink Gerding released her and turned to the kneeling man. \"Stand up, Elder Brother.\" \"I....\" Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft's jaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor. \"If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to recover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.\" Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink through half-closed eyes. \"No? Then get out of here, all of you. Samma! \" Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with the merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator. \"I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison,\" Dink said. \"Why did you do it?\" \"Have you read the story of Bluebeard?\" Orison asked. She stood close to Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see what it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was forbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for you, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you that the escudo green is pale.\" \"You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what is this thing you have about spiders?\" \"I've always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little girl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a spider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came home and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite for supper.\" \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider, Orison,\" he said. She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped in the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related to shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They're stone-and-metal eaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He extended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature, flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around the bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn't he?\" Dink asked. \"Here. You hold him.\" \"I'd rather not,\" she protested. \"I'd be happier if you did,\" Dink said."}

It felt crisp and hard, like a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and unfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm. \"He's like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said. \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial process we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and secret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\" \"What do they do?\" Orison asked. \"That's still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can't tell even you that, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.\" \"What's he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus, perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching against her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae. \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder, comfortably close. \"They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as children are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison. We'd better get you down where you belong.\" Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest tank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring. It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange, using crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I thought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something like the sighing of wind in winter trees.\" \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing together while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He took her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these little workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\" Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness, storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace and harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked. \"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been singing it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a wood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside. \"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand. \"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said. Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the mineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the liquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air. \"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling life. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands."}

Doc had this solemn human by the throat when I caught up with him. \"Tonight,\" Doc was saying in his old voice that was as crackled and important as parchment, \"tonight Man will reach the Moon. The golden Moon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when this is to happen.\" \"Sure,\" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's arthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. \"No argument. Sure, up we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the teeth!\" I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose, one finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that during all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled, but I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos in Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been wanted for the murder of a North American Mountie. It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame, layered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side. One of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the greasy collar of the human. \"I hope you'll forgive him, sir,\" I said, not meeting the man's eyes. \"He's my father and very old, as you can see.\" I laughed inside at the absurd, easy lie. \"Old events seem recent to him.\" The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight. \"'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But Great-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl. Sharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?\" I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three doors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen if we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for all I knew."}

I hated tourists and especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated Martians. They were aliens . They weren't men like Doc and me. Then I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and true. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having his. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first found him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we kept getting closer each of the times. I tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked flophouse doors. The tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of those little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance. \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he said mechanically. \"We'll use one bed,\" I told him. \"I'll give you twenty cents.\" I felt the round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining. \"Fifteen cents a bed,\" he played it back for me. Doc was quivering against me, his legs boneless. \"We can always make it over to the mission,\" I lied. The clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. \"Awright, since we ain't full up. In ad vance.\" I placed the quarter on the desk. \"Give me a nickel.\" The clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown before I could move, what with holding up Doc. \"You've got your nerve,\" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. \"Had a quarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents.\" He saw the look on my face. \"I'll give you a room for the two bits. That's better'n a bed for twenty.\" I knew I was going to need that nickel. Desperately. I reached across the desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the register hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed. \"Give me a nickel,\" I said. \"What nickel?\" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me. \"You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say so. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?\" I let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble and that did scare me. I had to get him alone. \"Where's the room?\" I asked."}

{"chunk_id": "Confidence_Game_3#0", "contents": "The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet high. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino singing on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't have any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone. I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face to shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the bedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily. Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning eyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so dirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy scalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's gas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed to shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I didn't need to. The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered, uncovered floor. It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a jagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it an unreal distortion. Doc began to mumble louder. I knew I had to move. I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I moved. I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found my notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both my mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I concentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their habit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were suddenly distinguishable. \" Outsider ... Thoth ... Dyzan ... Seven ... Hsan ... Beyond Six, Seven, Eight ... Two boxes ... Ralston ... Richard Wentworth ... Jimmy Christopher ... Kent Allard ... Ayem ... Oh, are ... see ....\""}

The pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped from my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me, I knew that these words were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed to know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation. That wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got to thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man around North America for nothing, I remembered who he was. I remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I had once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc. Pain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high screaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a nickel. Still, I had to get some. I crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy dirt. The door opened and shut—there was no lock. I shouldn't leave Doc alone, but I had to. He was starting to cry. He didn't always do that. I listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that crawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow. Doc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his face. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let him bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his lumpy skull. He shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back across his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like that. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.) I don't remember how I got out onto the street."}

She was wearing a powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the upper half of her legs. The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it wasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that. It was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin. I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody would help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they think you are blotto. \"Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?\" I kept my eyes down. I couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. \"Just a dime for a cup of coffee.\" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two and a half. I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used, perhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. \"Do you want it for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?\" I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized that anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate tourists. \"Just coffee, ma'am.\" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to call her that. \"A little more for food, if you could spare it.\" I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much. \"I'll buy you a dinner,\" she said carefully, \"provided I can go with you and see for myself that you actually eat it.\" I felt my face flushing red. \"You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum like me, ma'am.\" \"I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat.\" It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice whatever. \"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving."}
{"chunk_id": "Confidence_Game_6#0", "contents": "The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was pale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands to feel its warmth. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool beside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but there she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible tourist . I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could do. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and was able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt—good. Not abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of exhilaration. That was what coffee did for me. I was a caffeine addict. Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but I knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the same, but the need ran as deep. I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles with a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in them—not enough, never enough, but better than nothing. \"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked. I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human—an Earth human. I was a man , of course, not an alien like a Martian. Earthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an Earthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That proved it, didn't it? \"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all they had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but then I didn't have the local prejudices. I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how clean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so dirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every hour for the rest of my life. The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails and raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba, almost in a single movement of my jaws. Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a glass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting for me. \"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded. She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I just felt it. \"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she said. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\" That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said. \"It's Miss"}

She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar. \"What do you think of this?\" I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine. Dear Acolyte R. I.

Address : ..................... The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent. There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was trying to pull it out. I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five—if the lady didn't pay you.\" \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that bill out of your hand?\" I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant bar, smoothing it. I scooped up my change and walked out the door.

Neon light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had changed around—prayer came from the left, song from the right. Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a thing . My heart hammered at my lungs. I knew this last time had been different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a start. He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom. His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"—metal webbing—and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a meaningful whole. I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I became lost. I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any hungry rats out of the walls. I knelt beside Doc. \"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered. I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders? He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen, before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it. \"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\" I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of concentration. The words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most."}

I'm quite familiar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately. Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these months—time travel. A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled dressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and whitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I hated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a snowbird. \"My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these rooms,\" the thin man remarked, \"but never before have they used instantaneous materialization.\" The heavier man was half choking, half laughing. \"I say—I say, I would like to see you explain this, my dear fellow.\" \"I have no data,\" the thin man answered coolly. \"In such instance, one begins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask this unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious illness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place and time from which he comes.\" The surprise stung. \"How did you know?\" I asked. He gestured with a pale hand. \"To maintain a logical approach, I must reject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory—and despite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences recently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or retire from my profession—your arrival was then super-normal. I might say super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time, clearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading an article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it into one of his novels of scientific romance.\" I knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. \"But the other—\" \"Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your cranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my theories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have suffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth. Your over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You are at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else then would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary state?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Confidence_Game_10#0", "contents": "He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I couldn't trust to my own senses as he did. \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional creations.\" The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit for the addition of professional polish to my works.\" The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that looked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor would tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory and practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better equipped to judge whether we exist.\" There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had ever heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception to Relativity and the positron and negatron. \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke. \"Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory Perception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be. The great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we know them. The great literary creations assume reality.\" I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be the goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed redhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the detective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of unknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal. His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal symptoms.\" The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building up behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He was not really a snowbird. After a time, I asked the doctor a question. \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my professional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\" Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great and good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened. My heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote in sunlight and stepped toward it.... ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun."}

Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. \"It's all right. It's all right. It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read this myself.\" Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror. \"Don't move, Kevin,\" she said. \"I'll have to shoot you—maybe not to kill, but painfully.\" I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there was something else. \"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,\" I told her. She shook her head. \"I don't know what you think it does to you.\" It was getting hard for me to think. \"Who are you?\" She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable, North American Mounted Police. I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. \"What do you want?\" \"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical, topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist—he had his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?\" I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee. \"It takes money—money Doc didn't have—to make money,\" Miss Casey said, \"even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of Doc's character. He was a scholar.\" Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I needed some coffee. \"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right—until he started obtaining books that did not exist .\""}

I got to the chair, snatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the soothing liquid. I turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face. The coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress that looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber. The coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad, unreasonably happy. I tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy hands touch her scrubbed pink ones. I pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the thing on the floor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for a fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do. I looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway. \"Call me Andre,\" the Martian said. \"A common name but foreign. It should serve as a point of reference.\" I had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes I wondered if they really could. \"You won't need the gun,\" Andre said conversationally. \"I'll keep it, thanks. What do you want?\" \"I'll begin as Miss Casey did—by telling you things. Hundreds of people disappeared from North America a few months ago.\" \"They always do,\" I told him. \"They ceased to exist—as human beings—shortly after they received a book from Doc,\" the Martian said. Something seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but managed to hold onto the gun and stand up. \"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him, \"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the destruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but it was worth a try. \"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\" The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I tried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no matter how often I bathed. No words formed. \"But, Kevin,\" Andre said, \"you aren't that dirty.\""}

Which are you? \" Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth. \" What is Doc's full name? \" I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said, \"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\" From the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\" Then he disappeared. I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in search of what. \"He didn't use that,\" Andre said. So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in my mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind. I didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I had now. That and the thing he left. \"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock in a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members with certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the Book of Dyzan or the Book of Thoth or the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan or the Necronomican itself on human beings?\" \"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily. \"Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your Victorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached back into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than psychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books, the human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic, without food, without sex, without conflict—just as Doc has achieved such a state—a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex, even stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on the inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a state of pure thought.\" \"The North American government has to have this secret, Kevin,\" the girl said. \"You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.\""}

Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it. I kicked the thing to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we weren't now. Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't mind her touching me. \"I'm glad,\" she said. Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief? I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed it because I didn't want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose, direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could kick the habit—perhaps with Miss Casey's help—but I wasn't really confident.

Excepting the food, perhaps. And a disease that wasn't really. It was like an Earth forest in the fall, but it was not fall. The forest leaves were green and copper and purple and fiery red, and a wind sent patches of bright greenish sunlight dancing among the leaf shadows. The hunt party of the Explorer filed along the narrow trail, guns ready, walking carefully, listening to the distant, half familiar cries of strange birds. A faint crackle of static in their earphones indicated that a gun had been fired. \"Got anything?\" asked June Walton. The helmet intercom carried her voice to the ears of the others without breaking the stillness of the forest. \"Took a shot at something,\" explained George Barton's cheerful voice in her earphones. She rounded a bend of the trail and came upon Barton standing peering up into the trees, his gun still raised. \"It looked like a duck.\" \"This isn't Central Park,\" said Hal Barton, his brother, coming into sight. His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the bronze and red forest. \"They won't all look like ducks,\" he said soberly. \"Maybe some will look like dragons. Don't get eaten by a dragon, June,\" came Max's voice quietly into her earphones. \"Not while I still love you.\" He came out of the trees carrying the blood sample kit, and touched her glove with his, the grin on his ugly beloved face barely visible in the mingled light and shade. A patch of sunlight struck a greenish glint from his fishbowl helmet."}

A quarter of a mile back, the space ship Explorer towered over the forest like a tapering skyscraper, and the people of the ship looked out of the viewplates at fresh winds and sunlight and clouds, and they longed to be outside. But the likeness to Earth was danger, and the cool wind might be death, for if the animals were like Earth animals, their diseases might be like Earth diseases, alike enough to be contagious, different enough to be impossible to treat. There was warning enough in the past. Colonies had vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships which had touched on some plague planet. The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight spacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion. The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the alien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the copper and purple shadows. They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker browns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her someone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole in the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved. This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful, humanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller than any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood breathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung a sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder. They lowered their guns. \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he reached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be heard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\" The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest sounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of evolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be wearing a three day growth of red stubble. Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to Minos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\" \"English?\" gasped June. \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to you.... It's three hundred miles.... We saw your scout plane pass twice, but we couldn't attract its attention.\""}

Thirty-six light years—thirty-six times six trillion miles of monotonous space travel—to be told that the planet was already settled! \"We didn't know there was a colony here,\" she said. \"It is not on the map.\" \"We were afraid of that,\" the tall bronze man answered soberly. \"We have been here three generations and yet no traders have come.\" Max shifted the kit strap on his shoulder and offered a hand. \"My name is Max Stark, M.D. This is June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, M.D., and George Barton, Hal's brother, also M.D.\" \"Patrick Mead is the name,\" smiled the man, shaking hands casually. \"Just a hunter and bridge carpenter myself. Never met any medicos before.\" The grip was effortless but even through her airproofed glove June could feel that the fingers that touched hers were as hard as padded steel. \"What—what is the population of Minos?\" she asked. He looked down at her curiously for a moment before answering. \"Only one hundred and fifty.\" He smiled. \"Don't worry, this isn't a city planet yet. There's room for a few more people.\" He shook hands with the Bartons quickly. \"That is—you are people, aren't you?\" he asked startlingly. \"Why not?\" said Max with a poise that June admired. \"Well, you are all so—so—\" Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across the faces of the group. \"So varied.\" They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled. \"I mean,\" Patrick Mead said into the silence, \"all these—interesting different hair colors and face shapes and so forth—\" He made a vague wave with one hand as if he had run out of words or was anxious not to insult them. \"Joke?\" Max asked, bewildered. June laid a hand on his arm. \"No harm meant,\" she said to him over the intercom. \"We're just as much of a shock to him as he is to us.\" She addressed a question to the tall colonist on outside sound. \"What should a person look like, Mr. Mead?\" He indicated her with a smile. \"Like you.\" June stepped closer and stood looking up at him, considering her own description. She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles, like him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly humorous blue eyes. \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and me?\" Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin. \"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think that people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit so many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I suppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside down!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits?

But they were strangers. \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two years after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead families. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all related, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way people can look.\" Plague. \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked. \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting sickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to do about it.\" \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for some.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice. Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all the books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion, and never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship were indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone and machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace them. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife and bow. \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton. \"No.\" \"Any other diseases?\" \"Not a one.\" Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching awe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on the intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\""}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_4#0", "contents": "Their job had been made easy by the coming of Pat. They went back to the ship laughing, exchanging anecdotes with him. There was nothing now to keep Minos from being the home they wanted, except the melting sickness, and, forewarned against it, they could take precautions. The polished silver and black column of the Explorer seemed to rise higher and higher over the trees as they neared it. Then its symmetry blurred all sense of specific size as they stepped out from among the trees and stood on the edge of the meadow, looking up. \"Nice!\" said Pat. \"Beautiful!\" The admiration in his voice was warming. \"It was a yacht,\" Max said, still looking up, \"second hand, an old-time beauty without a sign of wear. Synthetic diamond-studded control board and murals on the walls. It doesn't have the new speed drives, but it brought us thirty-six light years in one and a half subjective years. Plenty good enough.\" The tall tanned man looked faintly wistful, and June realized that he had never had access to a full library, never seen a movie, never experienced luxury. He had been born and raised on Minos."}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_5#0", "contents": "\"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully. Max unslung the specimen kit from his shoulder, laid it on the carpet of plants that covered the ground and began to open it. \"Tests first,\" Hal Barton said. \"We have to find out if you people still carry this so-called melting sickness. We'll have to de-microbe you and take specimens before we let you on board. Once on, you'll be no good as a check for what the other Meads might have.\" Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and hypodermics. \"Are you going to jab me with those?\" Pat asked with interest. \"You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!\" Max grinned at Pat Mead, and Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the tall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a stab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being smaller and frailer than Pat Mead. \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid samples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the arm.\" Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed and inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine nerve surgeon on Earth. High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship and angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly, it veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from their earphones: \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He banked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could see his startled face looking through the glass at Pat. Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and pointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew away over the odd-colored forest. \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got through to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max dexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles without exposing them to air. \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still carry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't show on you, but still carry enough germs—if that's what caused it—to wipe out a planet.\" \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able to mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\" \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked. \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on board.\" \"More needles?\" \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\" \"Rough?\" \"It isn't easy.\" A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit decontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in glares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and compared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.

In the Explorer , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers, was the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes so like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused chemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing could live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to the body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name. But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had been known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human treatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and interplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding against disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient. Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and around like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall by peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered to insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given solutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic blasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being directed to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized and injected with various immunizing solutions. Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme dryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were dripped into his veins through long thin tubes. All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of allowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him."}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_6#0", "contents": "June stepped from the last shower stall into the locker room, zipped off her spacesuit with a sigh of relief, and contemplated herself in a wall mirror. Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall.... \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully. Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he asked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally get something to eat?\" \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully, using a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\" The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled chuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go jump in the lake?\" \"Are you hungry?\" \"No food since yesterday.\" \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and hung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which made shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast. They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing hamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of Pat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of antihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system would treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human blood cells, and fight back against them violently. One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive, so that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human cells, and thus succumb more rapidly. \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked. \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently. On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a viewplate. It showed a long scene of mountains in the distance on the horizon, and between them, rising step by step as they grew farther away, the low rolling hills, bronze and red with patches of clear green where there were fields. Someone was looking out, standing very still, as if she had been there a long time—Bess St. Clair, a Canadian woman. \"It looks like Winnipeg,\" she told them as they paused. \"When are you doctors going to let us out of this blithering barberpole? Look,\" she pointed. \"See that patch of field on the south hillside, with the brook winding through it? I've staked that hillside for our house. When do we get out?\""}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_7#0", "contents": "Reno Ulrich's tiny scout plane buzzed slowly in from the distance and began circling lazily. \"Sooner than you think,\" Max told her. \"We've discovered a castaway colony on the planet. They've done our tests for us by just living here. If there's anything here to catch, they've caught it.\" \"People on Minos?\" Bess's handsome ruddy face grew alive with excitement. \"One of them is down in the medical department,\" June said. \"He'll be out in twenty minutes.\" \"May I go see him?\" \"Sure,\" said Max. \"Show him the way to the dining hall when he gets out. Tell him we sent you.\" \"Right!\" She turned and ran down the ramp like a small girl going to a fire. Max grinned at June and she grinned back. After a year and a half of isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces, the sound of unfamiliar voices."}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_8#0", "contents": "They climbed the last two turns to the cafeteria, and entered to a rich subdued blend of soft music and quiet conversations. The cafeteria was a section of the old dining room, left when the rest of the ship had been converted to living and working quarters, and it still had the original finely grained wood of the ceiling and walls, the sound absorbency, the soft music spools and the intimate small light at each table where people leisurely ate and talked. They stood in line at the hot foods counter, and behind her June could hear a girl's voice talking excitedly through the murmur of conversation. \"—new man, honest! I saw him through the viewplate when they came in. He's down in the medical department. A real frontiersman.\" The line drew abreast of the counters, and she and Max chose three heaping trays, starting with hydroponic mushroom steak, raised in the growing trays of water and chemicals; sharp salad bowl with rose tomatoes and aromatic peppers; tank-grown fish with special sauce; four different desserts, and assorted beverages. Presently they had three tottering trays successfully maneuvered to a table. Brant St. Clair came over. \"I beg your pardon, Max, but they are saying something about Reno carrying messages to a colony of savages, for the medical department. Will he be back soon, do you know?\" Max smiled up at him, his square face affectionate. Everyone liked the shy Canadian. \"He's back already. We just saw him come in.\" \"Oh, fine.\" St. Clair beamed. \"I had an appointment with him to go out and confirm what looks like a nice vein of iron to the northeast. Have you seen Bess? Oh—there she is.\" He turned swiftly and hurried away. A very tall man with fiery red hair came in surrounded by an eagerly talking crowd of ship people. It was Pat Mead. He stood in the doorway, alertly scanning the dining room. Sheer vitality made him seem even larger than he was. Sighting June, he smiled and began to thread toward their table. \"Look!\" said someone. \"There's the colonist!\" Shelia, a pretty, jeweled woman, followed and caught his arm. \"Did you really swim across a river to come here?\" Overflowing with good-will and curiosity, people approached from all directions. \"Did you actually walk three hundred miles? Come, eat with us. Let me help choose your tray.\" Everyone wanted him to eat at their table, everyone was a specialist and wanted data about Minos. They all wanted anecdotes about hunting wild animals with a bow and arrow. \"He needs to be rescued,\" Max said. \"He won't have a chance to eat.\" June and Max got up firmly, edged through the crowd, captured Pat and escorted him back to their table. June found herself pleased to be claiming the hero of the hour."}

{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_9#0", "contents": "Pat sat in the simple, subtly designed chair and leaned back almost voluptuously, testing the way it gave and fitted itself to him. He ran his eyes over the bright tableware and heaped plates. He looked around at the rich grained walls and soft lights at each table. He said nothing, just looking and feeling and experiencing. \"When we build our town and leave the ship,\" June explained, \"we will turn all the staterooms back into the lounges and ballrooms and cocktail bars that used to be inside.\" \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" Pat said negligently. He cocked his head to the music, and tried to locate its source. \"That's big of you,\" said Max with gentle irony. They fell to, Pat beginning the first meal he had had in more than a day. Most of the other diners finished when they were halfway through, and began walking over, diffidently at first, then in another wave of smiling faces, handshakes, and introductions. Pat was asked about crops, about farming methods, about rainfall and floods, about farm animals and plant breeding, about the compatibility of imported Earth seeds with local ground, about mines and strata. There was no need to protect him. He leaned back in his chair and drawled answers with the lazy ease of a panther; where he could think of no statistic, he would fill the gap with an anecdote. It developed that he enjoyed spinning campfire yarns and especially being the center of interest. Between bouts of questions, he ate with undiminished and glowing relish. June noticed that the female specialists were prolonging the questions more than they needed, clustering around the table laughing at his jokes, until presently Pat was almost surrounded by pretty faces, eager questions, and chiming laughs. Shelia the beautiful laughed most chimingly of all. June nudged Max, and Max shrugged indifferently. It wasn't anything a man would pay attention to, perhaps. But June watched Pat for a moment more, then glanced uneasily back to Max. He was eating and listening to Pat's answers and did not feel her gaze. For some reason Max looked almost shrunken to her. He was shorter than she had realized; she had forgotten that he was only the same height as herself. She was dimly aware of the clear lilting chatter of female voices increasing at Pat's end of the table. \"That guy's a menace,\" Max said, and laughed to himself, cutting another slice of hydroponic mushroom steak. \"What's eating you?\" he added, glancing aside at her when he noticed her sudden stillness. \"Nothing,\" she said hastily, but she did not turn back to watching Pat Mead. She felt disloyal. Pat was only a superb animal. Max was the man she loved. Or—was he? Of course he was, she told herself angrily.

Yet the sense of dissatisfaction persisted, and along with it a feeling of guilt. Len Marlow, the protein tank-culture technician responsible for the mushroom steaks, had wormed his way into the group and asked Pat a question. Now he was saying, \"I don't dig you, Pat. It sounds like you're putting the people into the tanks instead of the vegetables!\" He glanced at them, looking puzzled. \"See if you two can make anything of this. It sounds medical to me.\" Pat leaned back and smiled, sipping a glass of hydroponic burgundy. \"Wonderful stuff. You'll have to show us how to make it.\" Len turned back to him. \"You people live off the country, right? You hunt and bring in steaks and eat them, right? Well, say I have one of those steaks right here and I want to eat it, what happens?\""}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_10#0", "contents": "\"Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest. You'd stay hungry.\" \"Why?\" Len was aggrieved. \"Chemical differences in the basic protoplasm of Minos. Different amino linkages, left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in the carbohydrates, things like that. Nothing will be digestible here until you are adapted chemically by a little test-tube evolution. Till then you'd starve to death on a full stomach.\" Pat's side of the table had been loaded with the dishes from two trays, but it was almost clear now and the dishes were stacked neatly to one side. He started on three desserts, thoughtfully tasting each in turn. \"Test-tube evolution?\" Max repeated. \"What's that? I thought you people had no doctors.\" \"It's a story.\" Pat leaned back again. \"Alexander P. Mead, the head of the Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality and no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle of killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the face of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided that he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying. He did it all right.'\" \"Did which?\" asked June, suddenly feeling a sourceless prickle of fear. \"Adapted us to Minos. He took human cells—\""}
{"chunk_id": "CONTAGION_11#0", "contents": "She listened intently, trying to find a reason for fear in the explanation. It would have taken many human generations to adapt to Minos by ordinary evolution, and that only at a heavy toll of death and hunger which evolution exacts. There was a shorter way: Human cells have the ability to return to their primeval condition of independence, hunting, eating and reproducing alone. Alexander P. Mead took human cells and made them into phagocytes. He put them through the hard savage school of evolution—a thousand generations of multiplication, hardship and hunger, with the alien indigestible food always present, offering its reward of plenty to the cell that reluctantly learned to absorb it. \"Leucocytes can run through several thousand generations of evolution in six months,\" Pat Mead finished. \"When they reached to a point where they would absorb Minos food, he planted them back in the people he had taken them from.\" \"What was supposed to happen then?\" Max asked, leaning forward. \"I don't know exactly how it worked. He never told anybody much about it, and when I was a little boy he had gone loco and was wandering ha-ha-ing around waving a test tube. Fell down a ravine and broke his neck at the age of eighty.\" \"A character,\" Max said. Why was she afraid? \"It worked then?\" \"Yes. He tried it on all the Meads the first year. The other settlers didn't want to be experimented on until they saw how it worked out. It worked. The Meads could hunt, and plant while the other settlers were still eating out of hydroponics tanks.\" \"It worked,\" said Max to Len. \"You're a plant geneticist and a tank culture expert. There's a job for you.\" \"Uh- uh !\" Len backed away. \"It sounds like a medical problem to me. Human cell control—right up your alley.\" \"It is a one-way street,\" Pat warned. \"Once it is done, you won't be able to digest ship food. I'll get no good from this protein. I ate it just for the taste.\" Hal Barton appeared quietly beside the table. \"Three of the twelve test hamsters have died,\" he reported, and turned to Pat. \"Your people carry the germs of melting sickness, as you call it. The dead hamsters were injected with blood taken from you before you were de-infected. We can't settle here unless we de-infect everybody on Minos. Would they object?\" \"We wouldn't want to give you folks germs,\" Pat smiled. \"Anything for safety. But there'll have to be a vote on it first.\" The doctors went to Reno Ulrich's table and walked with him to the hangar, explaining. He was to carry the proposal to Alexandria, mingle with the people, be persuasive and wait for them to vote before returning. He was to give himself shots of cureall every two hours on the hour or run the risk of disease."}

He had dabbled in sociology before retraining as a mechanic for the expedition. \"This gives me a chance to study their mores.\" He winked wickedly. \"I may not be back for several nights.\" They watched through the viewplate as he took off, and then went over to the laboratory for a look at the hamsters. Three were alive and healthy, munching lettuce. One was the control; the other two had been given shots of Pat's blood from before he entered the ship, but with no additional treatment. Apparently a hamster could fight off melting sickness easily if left alone. Three were still feverish and ruffled, with a low red blood count, but recovering. The three dead ones had been given strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine, so their bodies had not fought back against the attack. June glanced at the dead animals hastily and looked away again. They lay twisted with a strange semi-fluid limpness, as if ready to dissolve. The last hamster, which had been given the heaviest dose of adaptive, had apparently lost all its hair before death. It was hairless and pink, like a still-born baby. \"We can find no micro-organisms,\" George Barton said. \"None at all. Nothing in the body that should not be there. Leucosis and anemia. Fever only for the ones that fought it off.\" He handed Max some temperature charts and graphs of blood counts. June wandered out into the hall. Pediatrics and obstetrics were her field; she left the cellular research to Max, and just helped him with laboratory routine. The strange mood followed her out into the hall, then abruptly lightened. Coming toward her, busily telling a tale of adventure to the gorgeous Shelia Davenport, was a tall, red-headed, magnificently handsome man. It was his handsomeness which made Pat such a pleasure to look upon and talk with, she guiltily told herself, and it was his tremendous vitality.... It was like meeting a movie hero in the flesh, or a hero out of the pages of a book—Deer-slayer, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke. She waited in the doorway to the laboratory and made no move to join them, merely acknowledged the two with a nod and a smile and a casual lift of the hand. They nodded and smiled back. \"Hello, June,\" said Pat and continued telling his tale, but as they passed he lightly touched her arm. \"Oh, pioneer!\" she said mockingly and softly to his passing profile, and knew that he had heard."}

Navigator Farrell, youngest and certainly most impulsive of the three-man Terran Reclamations crew, would have set the Marco Four down at once but for the greater caution of Stryker, nominally captain of the group, and of Gibson, engineer, and linguist. Xavier, the ship's little mechanical, had—as was usual and proper—no voice in the matter. \"Reconnaissance spiral first, Arthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He chuckled at Farrell's instant scowl, his little eyes twinkling and his naked paunch quaking over the belt of his shipboard shorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection Five, Paragraph Twenty-seven: No planetfall on an unreclaimed world shall be deemed safe without proper— \" Farrell, as Stryker had expected, interrupted with characteristic impatience. \"Do you sleep with that damned Reclamations Handbook, Lee? Alphard Six isn't an unreclaimed world—it was never colonized before the Hymenop invasion back in 3025, so why should it be inhabited now?\" Gibson, who for four hours had not looked up from his interminable chess game with Xavier, paused with a beleaguered knight in one blunt brown hand. \"No point in taking chances,\" Gibson said in his neutral baritone. He shrugged thick bare shoulders, his humorless black-browed face unmoved, when Farrell included him in his scowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six light-years from Sol, at the old limits of Terran expansion, and there's no knowing what we may turn up here. Alphard's was one of the first systems the Bees took over. It must have been one of the last to be abandoned when they pulled back to 70 Ophiuchi.\" \"And I think you live for the day,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when we'll stumble across a functioning dome of live, buzzing Hymenops. Damn it, Gib, the Bees pulled out a hundred years ago, before you and I were born—neither of us ever saw a Hymenop, and never will!\" \"But I saw them,\" Stryker said. \"I fought them for the better part of the century they were here, and I learned there's no predicting nor understanding them. We never knew why they came nor why they gave up and left. How can we know whether they'd leave a rear-guard or booby trap here?\" He put a paternal hand on Farrell's shoulder, understanding the younger man's eagerness and knowing that their close-knit team would have been the more poorly balanced without it. \"Gib's right,\" he said. He nearly added as usual . \"We're on rest leave at the moment, yes, but our mission is still to find Terran colonies enslaved and abandoned by the Bees, not to risk our necks and a valuable Reorientations ship by landing blind on an unobserved planet.

Stryker's caution was justified on the instant. The speeding streamlined shape that had flashed up unobserved from below swerved sharply and exploded in a cataclysmic blaze of atomic fire that rocked the ship wildly and flung the three men to the floor in a jangling roar of alarms. \"So the Handbook tacticians knew what they were about,\" Stryker said minutes later. Deliberately he adopted the smug tone best calculated to sting Farrell out of his first self-reproach, and grinned when the navigator bristled defensively. \"Some of their enjoinders seem a little stuffy and obvious at times, but they're eminently sensible.\" When Farrell refused to be baited Stryker turned to Gibson, who was busily assessing the damage done to the ship's more fragile equipment, and to Xavier, who searched the planet's surface with the ship's magnoscanner. The Marco Four , Ringwave generators humming gently, hung at the moment just inside the orbit of Alphard Six's single dun-colored moon. Gibson put down a test meter with an air of finality. \"Nothing damaged but the Zero Interval Transfer computer. I can realign that in a couple of hours, but it'll have to be done before we hit Transfer again.\" Stryker looked dubious. \"What if the issue is forced before the ZIT unit is repaired? Suppose they come up after us?\" \"I doubt that they can. Any installation crudely enough equipped to trust in guided missiles is hardly likely to have developed efficient space craft.\" Stryker was not reassured. \"That torpedo of theirs was deadly enough,\" he said. \"And its nature reflects the nature of the people who made it. Any race vicious enough to use atomic charges is too dangerous to trifle with.\" Worry made comical creases in his fat, good-humored face. \"We'll have to find out who they are and why they're here, you know.\" \"They can't be Hymenops,\" Gibson said promptly. \"First, because the Bees pinned their faith on Ringwave energy fields, as we did, rather than on missiles. Second, because there's no dome on Six.\" \"There were three empty domes on Five, which is a desert planet,\" Farrell pointed out. \"Why didn't they settle Six? It's a more habitable world.\" Gibson shrugged. \"I know the Bees always erected domes on every planet they colonized, Arthur, but precedent is a fallible tool. And it's even more firmly established that there's no possibility of our rationalizing the motivations of a culture as alien as the Hymenops'—we've been over that argument a hundred times on other reclaimed worlds.\" \"But this was never an unreclaimed world,\" Farrell said with the faint malice of one"}

And that means we'll have to rule out any resurgent colonial group down there, because Six never had a colony in the beginning.\" \"The Bees have been gone for over a hundred years,\" Stryker said. \"Colonists might have migrated from another Terran-occupied planet.\" Gibson disagreed. \"We've touched at every inhabited world in this sector, Lee, and not one surviving colony has developed space travel on its own. The Hymenops had a hundred years to condition their human slaves to ignorance of everything beyond their immediate environment—the motives behind that conditioning usually escape us, but that's beside the point—and they did a thorough job of it. The colonists have had no more than a century of freedom since the Bees pulled out, and four generations simply isn't enough time for any subjugated culture to climb from slavery to interstellar flight.\" Stryker made a padding turn about the control room, tugging unhappily at the scanty fringe of hair the years had left him. \"If they're neither Hymenops nor resurgent colonists,\" he said, \"then there's only one choice remaining—they're aliens from a system we haven't reached yet, beyond the old sphere of Terran exploration. We always assumed that we'd find other races out here someday, and that they'd be as different from us in form and motivation as the Hymenops. Why not now?\" Gibson said seriously, \"Not probable, Lee. The same objection that rules out the Bees applies to any trans-Alphardian culture—they'd have to be beyond the atomic fission stage, else they'd never have attempted interstellar flight. The Ringwave with its Zero Interval Transfer principle and instantaneous communications applications is the only answer to long-range travel, and if they'd had that they wouldn't have bothered with atomics.\" Stryker turned on him almost angrily. \"If they're not Hymenops or humans or aliens, then what in God's name are they?\" \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell said, quoting a passage whose aptness had somehow seen it through a dozen reorganizations of insular tongue and a final translation to universal Terran. \"If they're none of those three, we've only one conclusion left. There's no one down there at all—we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\" Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation.

There's no one down there at all—we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\" Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation. Who's going to bell the cat this time?\" \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said at once. \"The ZIT computer can wait.\" Stryker vetoed his offer as promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes first. We may have to run for it, and we can't set up a Transfer jump without the computer. It's got to be me or Arthur.\" Farrell felt the familiar chill of uneasiness that inevitably preceded this moment of decision. He was not lacking in courage, else the circumstances under which he had worked for the past ten years—the sometimes perilous, sometimes downright charnel conditions left by the fleeing Hymenop conquerors—would have broken him long ago. But that same hard experience had honed rather than blunted the edge of his imagination, and the prospect of a close-quarters stalking of an unknown and patently hostile force was anything but attractive. \"You two did the field work on the last location,\" he said. \"It's high time I took my turn—and God knows I'd go mad if I had to stay inship and listen to Lee memorizing his Handbook subsections or to Gib practicing dead languages with Xavier.\" Stryker laughed for the first time since the explosion that had so nearly wrecked the Marco Four . \"Good enough. Though it wouldn't be more diverting to listen for hours to you improvising enharmonic variations on the Lament for Old Terra with your accordion.\" Gibson, characteristically, had a refinement to offer. \"They'll be alerted down there for a reconnaissance sally,\" he said. \"Why not let Xavier take the scouter down for overt diversion, and drop Arthur off in the helihopper for a low-level check?\" Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All right, Arthur?\" \"Good enough,\" Farrell said. And to Xavier, who had not moved from his post at the magnoscanner: \"How does it look, Xav? Have you pinned down their base yet?\" The mechanical answered him in a voice as smooth and clear—and as inflectionless—as a 'cello note. \"The planet seems uninhabited except for a large island some three hundred miles in diameter. There are twenty-seven small agrarian hamlets surrounded by cultivated fields. There is one city of perhaps a thousand buildings with a central square. In the square rests a grounded spaceship of approximately ten times the bulk of the Marco Four .\" They crowded about the vision screen, jostling Xavier's jointed gray shape in their interest. The central city lay in minutest detail before them, the battered hulk of the grounded ship glinting rustily in the late afternoon sunlight. Streets radiated away from the square in orderly succession, the whole so clearly depicted that they could see the throngs of people surging up and down, tiny foreshortened faces turned toward the sky. \"At least they're human,\""}

Relief replaced in some measure his earlier uneasiness. \"Which means that they're Terran, and can be dealt with according to Reclamations routine. Is that hulk spaceworthy, Xav?\" Xavier's mellow drone assumed the convention vibrato that indicated stark puzzlement. \"Its breached hull makes the ship incapable of flight. Apparently it is used only to supply power to the outlying hamlets.\" The mechanical put a flexible gray finger upon an indicator graph derived from a composite section of detector meters. \"The power transmitted seems to be gross electric current conveyed by metallic cables. It is generated through a crudely governed process of continuous atomic fission.\" Farrell, himself appalled by the information, still found himself able to chuckle at Stryker's bellow of consternation. \" Continuous fission? Good God, only madmen would deliberately run a risk like that!\" Farrell prodded him with cheerful malice. \"Why say mad men ? Maybe they're humanoid aliens who thrive on hard radiation and look on the danger of being blown to hell in the middle of the night as a satisfactory risk.\" \"They're not alien,\" Gibson said positively. \"Their architecture is Terran, and so is their ship. The ship is incredibly primitive, though; those batteries of tubes at either end—\" \"Are thrust reaction jets,\" Stryker finished in an awed voice. \"Primitive isn't the word, Gib—the thing is prehistoric! Rocket propulsion hasn't been used in spacecraft since—how long, Xav?\" Xavier supplied the information with mechanical infallibility. \"Since the year 2100 when the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle was discovered. That principle has served men since.\" Farrell stared in blank disbelief at the anomalous craft on the screen. Primitive, as Stryker had said, was not the word for it: clumsily ovoid, studded with torpedo domes and turrets and bristling at either end with propulsion tubes, it lay at the center of its square like a rusted relic of a past largely destroyed and all but forgotten. What a magnificent disregard its builders must have had, he thought, for their lives and the genetic purity of their posterity! The sullen atomic fires banked in that oxidizing hulk— Stryker said plaintively, \"If you're right, Gib, then we're more in the dark than ever. How could a Terran-built ship eleven hundred years old get here ?\" Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's contemplation of alternatives, seemed hardly to hear him. \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson said. \"If it's a Terran artifact, we can discover the reason for its presence.

We've got to determine first which case applies here.\" He waited for Farrell's expected irony, and when the navigator forestalled him by remaining grimly quiet, continued. \"The obvious premise is that a Terran ship must have been built by Terrans. Question: Was it flown here, or built here?\" \"It couldn't have been built here,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard Six was surveyed just before the Bees took over in 3025, and there was nothing of the sort here then. It couldn't have been built during the two and a quarter centuries since; it's obviously much older than that. It was flown here.\" \"We progress,\" Farrell said dryly. \"Now if you'll tell us how , we're ready to move.\" \"I think the ship was built on Terra during the Twenty-second Century,\" Gibson said calmly. \"The atomic wars during that period destroyed practically all historical records along with the technology of the time, but I've read well-authenticated reports of atomic-driven ships leaving Terra before then for the nearer stars. The human race climbed out of its pit again during the Twenty-third Century and developed the technology that gave us the Ringwave. Certainly no atomic-powered ships were built after the wars—our records are complete from that time.\" Farrell shook his head at the inference. \"I've read any number of fanciful romances on the theme, Gib, but it won't stand up in practice. No shipboard society could last through a thousand-year space voyage. It's a physical and psychological impossibility. There's got to be some other explanation.\" Gibson shrugged. \"We can only eliminate the least likely alternatives and accept the simplest one remaining.\" \"Then we can eliminate this one now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It entails a thousand-year voyage, which is an impossibility for any gross reaction drive; the application of suspended animation or longevity or a successive-generation program, and a final penetration of Hymenop-occupied space to set up a colony under the very antennae of the Bees. Longevity wasn't developed until around the year 3000—Lee here was one of the first to profit by it, if you remember—and suspended animation is still to come. So there's one theory you can forget.\" \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered ship couldn't have made such a trip, Gib.

And such a lineal-descendant project couldn't have lasted through forty generations, speculative fiction to the contrary—the later generations would have been too far removed in ideology and intent from their ancestors. They'd have adapted to shipboard life as the norm. They'd have atrophied physically, perhaps even have mutated—\" \"And they'd never have fought past the Bees during the Hymenop invasion and occupation,\" Farrell finished triumphantly. \"The Bees had better detection equipment than we had. They'd have picked this ship up long before it reached Alphard Six.\" \"But the ship wasn't here in 3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is now. Therefore it must have arrived at some time during the two hundred years of Hymenop occupation and evacuation.\" Farrell, tangled in contradictions, swore bitterly. \"But why should the Bees let them through? The three domes on Five are over two hundred years old, which means that the Bees were here before the ship came. Why didn't they blast it or enslave its crew?\" \"We haven't touched on all the possibilities,\" Gibson reminded him. \"We haven't even established yet that these people were never under Hymenop control. Precedent won't hold always, and there's no predicting nor evaluating the motives of an alien race. We never understood the Hymenops because there's no common ground of logic between us. Why try to interpret their intentions now?\" Farrell threw up his hands in disgust. \"Next you'll say this is an ancient Terran expedition that actually succeeded! There's only one way to answer the questions we've raised, and that's to go down and see for ourselves. Ready, Xav?\" But uncertainty nagged uneasily at him when Farrell found himself alone in the helihopper with the forest flowing beneath like a leafy river and Xavier's scouter disappearing bulletlike into the dusk ahead. We never found a colony so advanced, Farrell thought. Suppose this is a Hymenop experiment that really paid off? The Bees did some weird and wonderful things with human guinea pigs—what if they've created the ultimate booby trap here, and primed it with conditioned myrmidons in our own form? Suppose, he thought—and derided himself for thinking it—one of those suicidal old interstellar ventures did succeed? Xavier's voice, a mellow drone from the helihopper's Ringwave-powered visicom, cut sharply into his musing. \"The ship has discovered the scouter and is training an electronic beam upon it. My instruments record an electromagnetic vibration pattern of low power but rapidly varying frequency. The operation seems pointless.\" Stryker's voice followed, querulous with worry: \"I'd better pull Xav back. It may be something lethal.\" \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.

Surprisingly, there was excitement in the engineer's voice. \"I think they're trying to communicate with us.\" Farrell was on the point of demanding acidly to know how one went about communicating by means of a fluctuating electric field when the unexpected cessation of forest diverted his attention. The helihopper scudded over a cultivated area of considerable extent, fields stretching below in a vague random checkerboard of lighter and darker earth, an undefined cluster of buildings at their center. There was a central bonfire that burned like a wild red eye against the lower gloom, and in its plunging ruddy glow he made out an urgent scurrying of shadowy figures. \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\" Farrell reported. \"The one nearest the city, I think. There's something odd going on down—\" Catastrophe struck so suddenly that he was caught completely unprepared. The helihopper's flimsy carriage bucked and crumpled. There was a blinding flare of electric discharge, a pungent stink of ozone and a stunning shock that flung him headlong into darkness. He awoke slowly with a brutal headache and a conviction of nightmare heightened by the outlandish tone of his surroundings. He lay on a narrow bed in a whitely antiseptic infirmary, an oblong metal cell cluttered with a grimly utilitarian array of tables and lockers and chests. The lighting was harsh and overbright and the air hung thick with pungent unfamiliar chemical odors. From somewhere, far off yet at the same time as near as the bulkhead above him, came the unceasing drone of machinery. Farrell sat up, groaning, when full consciousness made his position clear. He had been shot down by God knew what sort of devastating unorthodox weapon and was a prisoner in the grounded ship. At his rising, a white-smocked fat man with anachronistic spectacles and close-cropped gray hair came into the room, moving with the professional assurance of a medic. The man stopped short at Farrell's stare and spoke; his words were utterly unintelligible, but his gesture was unmistakable. Farrell followed him dumbly out of the infirmary and down a bare corridor whose metal floor rang coldly underfoot. An open port near the corridor's end relieved the blankness of wall and let in a flood of reddish Alphardian sunlight; Farrell slowed to look out, wondering how long he had lain unconscious, and felt panic knife at him when he saw Xavier's scouter lying, port open and undefended, on the square outside. The mechanical had been as easily taken as himself, then.

Stryker and Gibson, for all their professional caution, would fare no better—they could not have overlooked the capture of Farrell and Xavier, and when they tried as a matter of course to rescue them the Marco would be struck down in turn by the same weapon. The fat medic turned and said something urgent in his unintelligible tongue. Farrell, dazed by the enormity of what had happened, followed without protest into an intersecting way that led through a bewildering succession of storage rooms and hydroponics gardens, through a small gymnasium fitted with physical training equipment in graduated sizes and finally into a soundproofed place that could have been nothing but a nursery. The implication behind its presence stopped Farrell short. \"A creche ,\" he said, stunned. He had a wild vision of endless generations of children growing up in this dim and stuffy room, to be taught from their first toddling steps the functions they must fulfill before the venture of which they were a part could be consummated. One of those old ventures had succeeded, he thought, and was awed by the daring of that thousand-year odyssey. The realization left him more alarmed than before—for what technical marvels might not an isolated group of such dogged specialists have developed during a millennium of application? Such a weapon as had brought down the helihopper and scouter was patently beyond reach of his own latter-day technology. Perhaps, he thought, its possession explained the presence of these people here in the first stronghold of the Hymenops; perhaps they had even fought and defeated the Bees on their own invaded ground. He followed his white-smocked guide through a power room where great crude generators whirred ponderously, pouring out gross electric current into arm-thick cables. They were nearing the bow of the ship when they passed by another open port and Farrell, glancing out over the lowered rampway, saw that his fears for Stryker and Gibson had been well grounded. The Marco Four , ports open, lay grounded outside. Farrell could not have said, later, whether his next move was planned or reflexive. The whole desperate issue seemed to hang suspended for a breathless moment upon a hair-fine edge of decision, and in that instant he made his bid. Without pausing in his stride he sprang out and through the port and down the steep plane of the ramp. The rough stone pavement of the square drummed underfoot; sore muscles tore at him, and weakness was like a weight about his neck. He expected momentarily to be blasted out of existence. He reached the Marco Four with the startled shouts of his guide ringing unintelligibly in his ears. The port yawned; he plunged inside and stabbed at controls without waiting to seat himself.

The ports swung shut. The ship darted up under his manipulation and arrowed into space with an acceleration that sprung his knees and made his vision swim blackly. He was so weak with strain and with the success of his coup that he all but fainted when Stryker, his scanty hair tousled and his fat face comical with bewilderment, stumbled out of his sleeping cubicle and bellowed at him. \"What the hell are you doing, Arthur? Take us down!\" Farrell gaped at him, speechless. Stryker lumbered past him and took the controls, spiraling the Marco Four down. Men swarmed outside the ports when the Reclamations craft settled gently to the square again. Gibson and Xavier reached the ship first; Gibson came inside quickly, leaving the mechanical outside making patient explanations to an excited group of Alphardians. Gibson put a reassuring hand on Farrell's arm. \"It's all right, Arthur. There's no trouble.\" Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't understand. They didn't shoot you and Xav down too?\" It was Gibson's turn to stare. \"No one shot you down! These people are primitive enough to use metallic power lines to carry electricity to their hamlets, an anachronism you forgot last night. You piloted the helihopper into one of those lines, and the crash put you out for the rest of the night and most of today. These Alphardians are friendly, so desperately happy to be found again that it's really pathetic.\" \" Friendly? That torpedo—\" \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\" Stryker put in. Understanding of the error under which Farrell had labored erased his earlier irritation, and he chuckled commiseratingly. \"They had one small boat left for emergency missions, and sent it up to contact us in the fear that we might overlook their settlement and move on. The boat was atomic powered, and our shield screens set off its engines.\" Farrell dropped into a chair at the chart table, limp with reaction. He was suddenly exhausted, and his head ached dully. \"We cracked the communications problem early last night,\" Gibson said. \"These people use an ancient system of electromagnetic wave propagation called frequency modulation, and once Lee and I rigged up a suitable transceiver the rest was simple. Both Xav and I recognized the old language; the natives reported your accident, and we came down at once.\" \"They really came from Terra? They lived through a thousand years of flight?\" \"The ship left Terra for Sirius in 2171,\" Gibson said. \"But not with these people aboard, or their ancestors.

That expedition perished after less than a light-year when its hydroponics system failed. The Hymenops found the ship derelict when they invaded us, and brought it to Alphard Six in what was probably their first experiment with human subjects. The ship's log shows clearly what happened to the original complement. The rest is deducible from the situation here.\" Farrell put his hands to his temples and groaned. \"The crash must have scrambled my wits. Gib, where did they come from?\" \"From one of the first peripheral colonies conquered by the Bees,\" Gibson said patiently. \"The Hymenops were long-range planners, remember, and masters of hypnotic conditioning. They stocked the ship with a captive crew of Terrans conditioned to believe themselves descendants of the original crew, and grounded it here in disabled condition. They left for Alphard Five then, to watch developments. \"Succeeding generations of colonists grew up accepting the fact that their ship had missed Sirius and made planetfall here—they still don't know where they really are—by luck. They never knew about the Hymenops, and they've struggled along with an inadequate technology in the hope that a later expedition would find them. They found the truth hard to take, but they're eager to enjoy the fruits of Terran assimilation.\" Stryker, grinning, brought Farrell a frosted drink that tinkled invitingly. \"An unusually fortunate ending to a Hymenop experiment,\" he said. \"These people progressed normally because they've been let alone. Reorienting them will be a simple matter; they'll be properly spoiled colonists within another generation.\" Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively. \"But I don't see why the Bees should go to such trouble to deceive these people. Why did they sit back and let them grow as they pleased, Gib? It doesn't make sense!\" \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson said. \"The Bees set up this colony as a control unit to study the species they were invading, and they had to give their specimens a normal—if obsolete—background in order to determine their capabilities. The fact that their experiment didn't tell them what they wanted to know may have had a direct bearing on their decision to pull out.\" Farrell shook his head. \"It's a reverse application, isn't it of the old saw about Terrans being incapable of understanding an alien culture?\" \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised. \"It's obvious enough, surely—hard as they tried, the Bees never understood us either.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Science Fiction Stories January 1960.

Not in his wildest imaginings had he thought they would actually find what they were looking for. \"Cut the drive!\" he yelled at Queazy. \"I've got it, right on the nose. Queazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that, we're rich! Come here!\" Queazy discharged their tremendous inertia into the motive-tubes in such a manner that the big, powerful ship was moving at the same rate as the asteroid below—47.05 miles per second. He came slogging back excitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big body shook with joyful ejaculations. \"She checks down to the last dimension,\" Bob chortled, working with slide-rule and logarithm tables. \"Now all we have to do is find out if she's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But there couldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, so this has to be it!\" He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out, and thumbed his nose at the signature. \"Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fifty thousand dollars!\" Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face. \"Better take it easy,\" he advised, \"until I land the ship and we use the atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the asteroid.\" \"Have it your way,\" Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergram to the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy—so called because his full name was Quentin Zuyler—dropped the ship straight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it tight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought out two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with star-powdered infinity spread to all sides. In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia, one of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates. It was addressed to: Mr. Robert Parker, President Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., 777 Main Street, Satterfield City, Fontanaland, Mars. The ethergram read: Received your advertising literature a week ago. Would like to state that yes I would like an asteroid in my back yard. Must meet following specifications: 506 feet length, long enough for wedding procession; 98 feet at base, tapering to 10 feet at apex; 9-12 feet thick; topside smooth-plane, underside rough-plane; composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar.

And if The Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on the rocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor & Saylor, a rival firm) neither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answering ethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. It was, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chance there was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worries would be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed like an incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions of asteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space only three weeks. The \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea had been Bob Parker's originally. Now it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the first rich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid. Unfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in on that brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers—which persons Bob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would have before this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants. Now that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate to get it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might get wind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits. Which was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor & Saylor made no pretense of being scrupulous. Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, the magnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. They came to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge and \"down\" the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parker happily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface. By the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar, but he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn't use it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, and then sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, tore atoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. The radiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams to the atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowly up and up—past tungsten, past iridium, past gold— Bob Parker said, in astonishment, \"Hell! There's something screwy about this business. Look at that point—\" Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer any further. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said, \"May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?\" Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and the lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as he could inside the \"aquarium\"—the glass helmet, and found himself looking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the asteroid \"below.\""}

It was a spasticizer, and it was three times as big as her gloved hand. \"I understand conditions better than you do,\" she said. \"You want to move this asteroid from its orbit and haul it back to Earth. Unfortunately, this is my home, by common law. Come back in a month. I don't expect to be here then.\" \"A month!\" Parker burst the word out. He started to sweat, then his face became grim. He took two slow steps toward the girl. She blinked and lost her composure and unconsciously backed up two steps. About twenty steps away was her small dumbbell-shaped ship, so shiny and unscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved surface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would be too late! He said grimly, \"Don't worry. I don't intend to pull any rough stuff. I just want you to listen to reason. You've taken a whim to stay on an asteroid that doesn't mean anything to you one way or another. But to us—to me and Queazy here—it means our business. We got an order for this asteroid. Some screwball millionaire wants it for a backyard wedding see? We get five hundred and fifty thousand dollars for it! If we don't take this asteroid to Earth before June 2, we go back to Satterfield City and work the rest of our lives in the glass factories. Don't we, Queazy?\" Queazy said simply, \"That's right, miss. We're in a spot. I assure you we didn't expect to find someone living here.\" The girl holstered her spasticizer, but her completely inhospitable expression did not change. She put her hands on the bulging hips of her space-suit. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Now I understand the conditions. Now we both understand each other. G'bye again. I'm staying here and—\" she smiled sweetly \"—it may interest you to know that if I let you have the asteroid you'll save your business, but I'll"}

I'm staying here and—\" she smiled sweetly \"—it may interest you to know that if I let you have the asteroid you'll save your business, but I'll meet a fate worse than death! So that's that.\" Bob recognized finality when he saw it. \"Come on, Queazy,\" he said fuming. \"Let this brat have her way. But if I ever run across her without a space-suit on I'm going to give her the licking of her life, right where it'll do the most good!\" He turned angrily, but Queazy grabbed his arm, his mouth falling open. He pointed off into space, beyond the girl. \"What's that?\" he whispered. \"What's wha— Oh! \" Bob Parker's stomach caved in. A few hundred feet away, floating gently toward the asteroid, came another ship—a ship a trifle bigger than their own. The girl turned, too. They heard her gasp. In another second, Bob was standing next to her. He turned the audio-switch to his headset off, and spoke to the girl by putting his helmet against hers. \"Listen to me, miss,\" he snapped earnestly, when she tried to draw away. \"Don't talk by radio. That ship belongs to the Saylor brothers! Oh, Lord, that this should happen! Somewhere along the line, we've been double-crossed. Those boys are after this asteroid too, and they won't hesitate to pull any rough stuff. We're in this together, understand? We got to back each other up.\" The girl nodded dumbly. Suddenly she seemed to be frightened. \"It's—it's very important that this—this asteroid stay right where it is,\" she said huskily. \"What—what will they do?\""}
{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_4#0", "contents": "Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue sparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic clamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and five men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood surveying the three who faced them. The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their darkish, twin faces were grinning broadly. \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you think of this situation Billy?\" \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his heels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have to take steps.\" The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling laughter. Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an ethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\" \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled—and his smile remained fixed, dangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came abreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave back a step, as he saw their intentions. \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll report you to the Interplanetary Commission!\" It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of these men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of the girl's spasticizer—a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained chance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at Queazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He hurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid and threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph. At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his hand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked the smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something crushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar plexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back, and his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely, before the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete darkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage—then a scream of pain. What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick, he didn't care. Then—lights out."}
{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_5#0", "contents": "Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. He opened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sun swept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base of his skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There was no asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space. Alone in a space-suit. \"Queazy!\" he whispered. \"Queazy! I'm running out of air!\" There was no answer from Queazy. With sick eyes, Bob studied the oxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds! That meant he had been floating around out here—how long? Days at least—maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a dose of spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to the snapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animation that his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fight against panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He was probably scrawny. And he was hungry! \"I'll starve,\" he thought. \"Or suffocate to death first!\" He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes, then hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enough air in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hoping that somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the same condition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers. Murderers, both of them! Up until this time, he had merely thought of them as business rivals. If he ever got out of this— He groaned. He never would get out of it! After another hour, he was gasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy's name once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strength to call it. And this time the headset spoke back! Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed with static, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound in his throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he saw a ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in his ears. He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and the girl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot. His \"aquarium\" was unbuckled and good air washed over his streaming face. The sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lying on a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in his clearing eyes and he knew he was alive—and going to stay that way, for awhile anyway. \"Thanks, Queazy,\" he said huskily. Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from his suddenly brightening face. \"Don't thank me,\" he whispered. \"We'd have both been goners if it hadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like us, and when she woke"}

The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like us, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship. She unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gave her enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used the direction-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylors scattered us far and wide.\" Queazy's broad, normally good-humored face twisted blackly. \"The so and so's didn't care if we lived or died.\" Bob saw the girl now, standing a little behind Queazy, looking down at him curiously, but unhappily. Her space-suit was off. She was wearing lightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paper flower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyes widened on her. The girl said glumly, \"I guess you men won't much care for me when you find out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal—Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter!\""}
{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_6#0", "contents": "Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger. \"Say that again?\" he snapped. \"This is some kind of dirty trick you and your grandfather cooked up?\" \"No!\" she exclaimed. \"No. My grandfather didn't even know there was an asteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you—or from the Saylor brothers. You see—well, my granddad's about the stubbornest old hoot-owl in this universe! He's always had his way, and when people stand in his way, that's just a challenge to him. He's been badgering me for years to marry Mac, and so has Mac—\" \"Who's Mac?\" Queazy demanded. \"My fiancé, I guess,\" she said helplessly. \"He's one of my granddad's protégés. Granddad's always financing some likely young man and giving him a start in life. Mac has become pretty famous for his Mercurian water-colors—he's an artist. Well, I couldn't hold out any longer. If you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely impossible it is to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass of nerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid belt and picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take place on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I told my grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on top of an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten, and so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make sure that if somebody did find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be able to get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here. Asteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them, by common law.... So I had everything figured out—except,\" she added bitterly, \"the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make sure the asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.\" Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and was gratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating only a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy. \"How long were we floating around out there?\" \"Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us a stiff shot.\" \" Ouch! \" Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal with determination. \"Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and your granddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'm going to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor brothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and ours both travel on the HH drive—inertia-less. But the asteroid has plenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a long, spiraling orbit.

Then her attractive face fell. \"Oh,\" she said. \" Oh! And when you get it back, you'll land it.\" \"That's right,\" Bob said grimly. \"We're in business. For us, it's a matter of survival. If the by-product of delivering the asteroid is your marriage—sorry! But until we do get the asteroid back, we three can work as a team if you're willing. We'll fight the other problem out later. Okay?\" She smiled tremulously. \"Okay, I guess.\" Queazy looked from one to another of them. He waved his hand scornfully at Bob. \"You're plain nuts,\" he complained. \"How do you propose to go about convincing the Saylor brothers they ought to let us have the asteroid back? Remember, commercial ships aren't allowed to carry long-range weapons. And we couldn't ram the Saylor brothers' ship—not without damaging our own ship just as much. Go ahead and answer that.\" Bob looked at Queazy dismally. \"The old balance-wheel,\" he groaned at Starre. \"He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. All I know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In the meantime, Starre—ahem—none of us has eaten in three weeks...?\" Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward the galley."}
{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_7#0", "contents": "Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after five days out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth; probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn't attach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailed astern, attached by a long cable. Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifth day Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and she gently lifted his hand from a finger-switch. \"Even I know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder, Bob. That switch is for the—ah—the anathern tube, you told me. Right?\" \"Right,\" he said unsteadily. \"Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, this ship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula. All moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Holloway and Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused the contraction first—motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affects every atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We could go from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second just like that!\" He snapped his fingers. \"No acceleration effects. This type of ship, necessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move in any direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motion at—Oh, hell!\" Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making him shake. He took her hand. \"Starre,\" he said desperately, \"I've got to tell you something—\" She jerked her hand away. \"No,\" she exclaimed in an almost frightened voice. \"You can't tell me. There's—there's Mac,\" she finished, faltering. \"The asteroid—\" \"You have to marry him?\" Her eyes filled with tears. \"I have to live up to the bargain.\" \"And ruin your whole life,\" he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back to the control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely to the lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell ship trailing astern. \"There's your ship, Starre.\" He jabbed his finger at it. \"I've got a feeling—and I can't put the thought into concrete words—that somehow the whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back lies there. But how? How? \" Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it was attached around her ship's narrow midsection. She shook her head helplessly. \"It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.\" \"A yo-yo?\" \"Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.\" She was belligerent. \"A yo-yo !\" Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he got out of the chair so fast. \"Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!\" He disappeared from the room. \"Queazy!\" he shouted. \" Queazy, I've got it! \""}

{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_8#0", "contents": "It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job, fastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's narrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to two winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and reinforced. The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob Parker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of cosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into strange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the end of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy snapped his fingers. \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the Saylor brothers are where we calculated!\" They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had discovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid on their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to the still bigger asteroid—inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred thousand miles from Earth! \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within naked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was spread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere vaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship was two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant sky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth. Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\" Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then sent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten miles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the \"yo-yo.\" There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But, scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm the oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought, for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero—and Starre Lowenthal's little ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving! It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid lengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a fantastic spinning cannon ball. \"It's going to hit!\" The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship reached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of completing its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back up the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left."}

{"chunk_id": "COSMIC_YO-YO_9#0", "contents": "Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuver for the \"yo-yo\" could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It was ticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used exactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of the ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in his glove—namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost exactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid dividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released again. All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor brothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on. But by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with better calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid between them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for the asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing it, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came spinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and again the \"yo-yo\" snapped out. And this time—collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the hand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to the principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had received a mere dent in its starboard half. Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This time we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\" The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly. Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish communication. Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the telaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in the plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath. \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared. \"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our stern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\" \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\" \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor. \" If you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless you release the asteroid.\" \"I'll see you in Hades first!\" \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\" He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at zero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie. For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a doomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size with a strangled yell. The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in such a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as heavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling precision.

Like a wounded terrier, their ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for a second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from its still-intact jets.

Lots of beach on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time. The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars—we're close to the center of a globular cluster, you know....\" \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\" \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this year's different. This is Wine Year.\""}
{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_3#0", "contents": "Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine crop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going. But this year....\" \"The crop isn't panning out?\" \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's not the crop.\" \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the Commercial—\" \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever settled for anything else!\" \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have to try them some time.\" Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No time like the present,\" he said. Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire. \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said. \"This isn't drinking . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the air. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle. \"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked. Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint native customs.\" Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked at Arapoulous thoughtfully. \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted port.\" \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a mouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second bottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine and black.\""}
{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_4#0", "contents": "Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork, caught it as it popped up. \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years back?\" \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two fresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\" \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said, swallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em. We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise. But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\" \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast beef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\" \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when you're doing it for strangers.\" \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief said. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\" \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can turn over to machinery—and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in. First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright, and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall, the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on: roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes for the best crews. \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his toes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer of grape juice?\""}

{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_5#0", "contents": "\"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time—\" \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\" \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief said. \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad. We've got a bumper crop—and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then next vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage—\" \"You hocked the vineyards?\" \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\" \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red is hard to beat....\" \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture—\" \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci nose-flute players—\" \"Can they pick grapes?\" \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over with the Labor Office?\" \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics specialists and computer programmers we wanted—but no field hands. Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought I was trying to buy slaves.\" The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen. \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\" \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he said. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something. Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles here. Cultural exhibits, you know.\" II As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague across the table. \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie. What are they getting?\" Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over at MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and Exchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\" \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\" \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket, blinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE interested in MEDDLE's activities?\" \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over on—\" \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\" \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations' General Economies have been trying"}

While my chance to make a record—that is, assist peace-loving d'Land—comes to naught.\" He shook his head. \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an institution.\" \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\" \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\" \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two hundred students would overtax the facilities of the college.\" \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\" \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students indeed!\" He snorted and walked away."}
{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_6#0", "contents": "Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and ordered a beer. A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass. \"Happy days,\" he said. \"And nights to match.\" \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh. Yep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place waiting....\" \"You meeting somebody?\" \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect—Never mind. Have one on me.\" \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\" \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know—\" he turned to Retief—\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped. \"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\" \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\" The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\" \"I represent MUDDLE.\" Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under pressure. If I had my old platoon—\" He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So long, friend. Or are you coming along?\" Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\""}
{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_7#0", "contents": "At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to attention, his chest out. \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to act?\" The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned. \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to town? We fellas were thinking—\" \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now line up!\" \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like to bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid on.\" \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't have the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about going over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\" \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\" \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He hiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\" \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\" \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\" \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\" \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh winked. \"And bring a few beers.\" \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging from Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female students?\" \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch is received.\" Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle. \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound for?\" \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\" \"Would that be the Technical College?\" Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these details.\" \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief said. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are travelling so far to study—at Corps expense.\" \"Mr. Magnan never—\" \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves me with the question of two thousand young male students headed for a world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors. But the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation to Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on Lovenbroy.\" \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows. \"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\" \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But never mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors will Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\" \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan always—\" \"I'm sure he did.

{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_8#0", "contents": "Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the office, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over indices. \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\" \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said. \"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored vehicle. \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental siege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\" \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want is a tractor. Model WV M-1—\" \"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for demolition work. That must be what confused you.\" \"Probably—among other things. Thank you.\" Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you wanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the impression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths—\" \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\" \"Five hundred.\" \"Are you sure?\" Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent—\" \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five hundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\" \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly. \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said. III Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP 7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry. Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and sipped the black wine meditatively. It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the production of such vintages.... Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial Attache. \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment, the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show we're shipping five hundred units....\" \"That's correct. Five hundred.\" Retief waited. \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\" \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred tractors.\" \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle—\" \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\" Retief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any ore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining outfit? I should think—\" \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few"}

Frankly—is this a closed line?\" \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\" \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation to a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\" \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\" Retief said. \"Any connection?\" \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\" \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\" \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\" \"Who gets them?\" \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see—\" \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized transshipment of grant material?\" \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative.\" \"And when will they be shipped?\" \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now.

I don't know myself.\" Retief rang off, buzzed the secretary. \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement of students.\" \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now. Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\" \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\" \"I'll ask him if he has time.\" \"Great.

That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with pursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another two thousand to Featherweight.\" \"Another under-populated world—and in the same cluster, I believe,\" Retief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region of space.\" \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of importance to see to.\" After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a break-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the present program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what MEDDLE has been shipping lately.\" Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.

I want to talk to you.\" In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you, Retief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\" Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"What do you know about Croanie?\" \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon time. Over a foot long.\" \"You on good terms with them?\" \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\" \"So?\" \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of bad luck.

{"chunk_id": "CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_12#0", "contents": "At the baggage warehouse Gulver looked glumly at the opened cases of guns. \"No, of course not,\" he said dully. \"Not my baggage. Not my baggage at all.\" Arapoulous appeared, supporting the stumbling figure of Mr. Karsh. \"What—what's this?\" Gulver spluttered. \"Karsh? What's happened?\" \"He had a little fall. He'll be okay,\" Arapoulous said. \"You'd better help him to the ship,\" Retief said. \"It's ready to lift. We wouldn't want him to miss it.\" \"Leave him to me!\" Gulver snapped, his eyes slashing at Karsh. \"I'll see he's dealt with.\" \"I couldn't think of it,\" Retief said. \"He's a guest of the Corps, you know. We'll see him safely aboard.\" Gulver turned, signaled frantically. Three heavy-set men in identical drab suits detached themselves from the wall, crossed to the group. \"Take this man,\" Gulver snapped, indicating Karsh, who looked at him dazedly, reached up to rub his head. \"We take our hospitality seriously,\" Retief said. \"We'll see him aboard the vessel.\" Gulver opened his mouth. \"I know you feel bad about finding guns instead of school books in your luggage,\" Retief said, looking Gulver in the eye. \"You'll be busy straightening out the details of the mix-up. You'll want to avoid further complications.\" \"Ah. Ulp. Yes,\" Gulver said. He appeared unhappy. Arapoulous went on to the passenger conveyor, turned to wave. \"Your man—he's going too?\" Gulver blurted. \"He's not our man, properly speaking,\" Retief said. \"He lives on Lovenbroy.\" \"Lovenbroy?\" Gulver choked. \"But ... the ... I....\" \"I know you said the students were bound for d'Land,\" Retief said. \"But I guess that was just another aspect of the general confusion. The course plugged into the navigators was to Lovenbroy. You'll be glad to know they're still headed there—even without the baggage.\" \"Perhaps,\" Gulver said grimly, \"perhaps they'll manage without it.\" \"By the way,\" Retief said. \"There was another funny mix-up. There were some tractors—for industrial use, you'll recall. I believe you co-operated with Croanie in arranging the grant through MEDDLE. They were erroneously consigned to Lovenbroy, a purely agricultural world. I saved you some embarrassment, I trust, Mr. Gulver, by arranging to have them off-loaded at d'Land.\" \"D'Land! You've put the CSU's in the hands of Boge's bitterest enemies!\" \"But they're only tractors, Mr. Gulver. Peaceful devices. Isn't that correct?\" \"That's ... correct.\" Gulver sagged. Then he snapped erect. \"Hold the ships!\" he yelled. \"I'm canceling the student exchange—\" His voice was drowned by the rumble as the first of the monster transports rose from the launch pit, followed a moment later by the second, Retief watched them out of sight, then turned to Gulver. \"They're off,\" he said. \"Let's hope they get a liberal education.\" V Retief lay on his back in deep grass by a stream, eating grapes. A tall figure appeared on the knoll above him and waved. \"Retief!\" Hank Arapoulous bounded down the slope and embraced Retief, slapping him on the back. \"I heard you were here—and I've got news for you.

A tall girl dressed in loose white, and with long golden hair, came up to Arapoulous. \"Delinda, this is Retief—today's winner. And he's also the fellow that got those workers for us.\" Delinda smiled at Retief. \"I've heard about you, Mr. Retief. We weren't sure about the boys at first. Two thousand Bogans, and all confused about their baggage that went astray. But they seemed to like the picking.\" She smiled again. \"That's not all. Our gals liked the boys,\" Hank said. \"Even Bogans aren't so bad, minus their irons. A lot of 'em will be staying on. But how come you didn't tell me you were coming, Retief?

I hope you didn't get into any trouble over it.\" \"No trouble,\" Retief said. \"A few people were a little unhappy with me. It seems I'm not ready for important assignments at Departmental level. I was shipped off here to the boondocks to get a little more experience.\" \"Delinda, look after Retief,\" said Arapoulous. \"I'll see you later. I've got to see to the wine judging.\" He disappeared in the crowd. \"Congratulations on winning the day,\" said Delinda. \"I noticed you at work. You were wonderful.

But why weren't you picking grapes with the rest of us?\" \"I had a special assignment.\" \"Too bad.

{"chunk_id": "DEATH_STAR_1#0", "contents": "DEATH STAR By TOM PACE Trapped by the most feared of space pirates Devil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for his life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was pinning his hopes on a girl—who wanted him dead. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Starrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It was only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands of feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the only things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha Centauri III—called the most barren planet in space. Ten minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters before him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and the air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil Garrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him. For eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the void. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on a tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's ship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake. That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts of power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an atomics plant on Alpha III—if he had, escaping rays would point it out, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power, for there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal power was out, for Alpha III had no moon. However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his water-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as a man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place. It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men, and he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star. His fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\" The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He saw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he nodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back. Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate jerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun. The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug into the man's heart. Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both electron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the leveled gun from the corner of his eye. He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into a dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a split-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had been standing. While a jet-gun"}

The three actions took only a split-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had been standing. While a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a loading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew this very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the spur of stone to fire his own gun. If his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have blasted the girl."}
{"chunk_id": "DEATH_STAR_2#0", "contents": "He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was something to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her next move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five tall, black-haired—the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun darkness—dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would make anyone stop and gulp. Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet on him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll blast you ... pirate !\" Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the magazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\" The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a half-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I—I don't believe ...\" she broke off abruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a pirate.\" Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to you, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his belt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and flung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side, and paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him to land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily cursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl, so that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered why it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl. Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was hurled into blackness. An eternity seemed to pass. Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a far-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner of the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and strangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the sun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some were vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and there was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes. Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It was the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett. That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had been doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking at Garrett. The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and twice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting on a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight. He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said, \"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\" Star's jaw dropped."}

He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said, \"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\" Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you—\" he broke off. A glance at the girl told him what the purpose was. \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss Hinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool us.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your ship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going to hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while, I'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen, connected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see Devil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered on you!\" Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a minute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said mockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\" Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron fire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\" Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a person who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped forward, shaking with rage. \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have been able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't called yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward Garrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample proof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown me papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of you....\" Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he started to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and someone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull."}
{"chunk_id": "DEATH_STAR_3#0", "contents": "When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the door told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the lady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a mocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\" Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze left in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for various weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone. Garrett's men had searched carefully. Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from physical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That was most important right now. But other things were bothering him, tugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each trying to shove it in a different direction. There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind first. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression that he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett. Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had called her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving that the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into! Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed, and he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like that. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as a \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if that would make it far worse. His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One hand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but all the others had been found. Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the cell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on, Blade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth. \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that girl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that girl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil Garrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\" Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one who had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a clubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and ducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder up under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp blows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand leaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held. Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock"}

As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the electron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver. Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent, walked over and out, at the point of the weapon."}
{"chunk_id": "DEATH_STAR_4#0", "contents": "Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death. He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in his hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the universally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon. Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it. The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained to her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or have executed, by anyone. Which was very true. A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star felt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If the image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in—Garrett would undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed Starrett Blade—then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in time to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo over the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let the girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want that. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade. Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It was not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter which had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger units in it. The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus the girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's death. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily that he could have the chance to interfere. The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen change, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander Weddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips move—then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun in his hand.... The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an expression of shocked surprise on his face—surprise, Blade thought desperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil Garrett. Which was right, in a way. Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's finger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath involuntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal—a fork—and flung it at the vision transmitter. Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a certain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for the large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result. Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can curse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric flame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine. It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him time to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor"}

It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him time to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him. One of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's head, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw was the girl. Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had been. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck him. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and unconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the girl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This was the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not getting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty. Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door. He wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided that he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly heard the door being opened. But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly, despite his head. It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain, he could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell against the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him."}

It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of—with no other phrase to do—compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head on the girl's breast, and closed his eyes. In a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked up at her. \"I guess so. Here—give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as he tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all right, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like—say! How come you're doing this? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\" She said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That transmission set.... I can read lips! I knew what that officer was saying! It was just as if I had heard him say that ... that you were Starrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a choking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\" \"A month? Huh—please—you...?\" Star took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who are you? What are you doing here?\" She said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you heard of him?\" \"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment ' Blade Cosmian ' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ... the ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I should have recognized the name. But go on. What—\" \"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett Blade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power processes. And he is! He has a new—or maybe it isn't so new—way of electrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\" \"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and hydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive a turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and even the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\" \"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said that atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\" \"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another application of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that he wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had another plan behind it. Got any idea?\" Anne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\" \"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door. Star whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett stood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand could kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to resist with.

And they had no weapons to resist with. Devil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor, through a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and into a huge room. It must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at least a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic machines. Between the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders and cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass of equipment Starrett had ever seen. His eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down at the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the mighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis chambers. And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from the electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be nothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed to re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be turbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just under the platforms on which they stood."}
{"chunk_id": "DEATH_STAR_6#0", "contents": "Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It could be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett. The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\" Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course. But let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines after the wheels?\" \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\" \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said. \"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you recognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little plant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes! \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha III. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect it! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket shells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or to warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his eyes aglow. \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet, and I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the first time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret patents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\" Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place. It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a jet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device fixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller than an old-style fountain pen. He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever before. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness of his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one instant. And Devil Garrett died. There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white fire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire from Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into Garrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as his muscles started the jerking movement. And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp. Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and swore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand had already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the electron stud, she buried the knife in his back. Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a devil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his final mistake.

The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not into the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room filled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the room below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you going to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\" There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He can't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\" \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one they call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight. You can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice. \"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out.

He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star, what are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little while. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when they come up to investigate?\" Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander Weddel!\" \" What? \" Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne spun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the corridor. \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed the vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is included in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except in the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect of unrestricted cosmic rays.\" \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how—\" Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is impossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on it, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is broken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a distress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal is recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw me throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the automatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from a location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity cruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He stopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See these papers?\" \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\" \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're the one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the barren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\" He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and up through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured softly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky, level except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be the life of Centauri!\""}

After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how soon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean, how long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you described?\" \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\" \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do, Star.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought that planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] An unprovoked, meaningless night attack is terrifying enough on your own home planet, worse on a world across the Galaxy. But the horror is the offer of help that cannot be accepted! \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high. Adrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you. Intent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\" \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible to anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on the walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the habitat hotel and sit tight.\" \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it safe for a stranger to walk through the city?\" \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around apprehensively. \"Where is he?\" \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise display.\" A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was accustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple bobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all travelers were crazy. Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk. It would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he could walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea? A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was peculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was at a definite disadvantage. \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in mind.\" \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look unconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and stared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside, he might find safety for a time. Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude him in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the streets would be brightly lighted—for native eyes. A human would consider it dim. \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be something he hopes to gain.\" \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations. At short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report what a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in finding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem over to the godawful police.\" \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.

That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give the police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various reasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called Dimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own, say, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the proper approach, either. \"Weapons?\" \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long knife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\" Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in semantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could die from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of protection himself. \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on tenuous evidence.\" \"Let's have it anyway.\" \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For some reason you can't get off this planet.\" That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand star systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one. Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a transfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he had left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here. He hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't unusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as reliable as they might be. Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with that delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was self-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?"}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_2#0", "contents": "Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself. He was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched to his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the basis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long journey, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go to Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the company that employed him, and possibly not even to them. The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his mission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money wasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What did the thug want? Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was too well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for anyone this far away to have learned about it. And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as dead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't involve too much risk. \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\" Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of that boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually was on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives like rain. He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the rain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it unhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility and the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the near amphibians who created it. A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport tide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made life dangerous for a human—Venice revised, brought up to date in a faster-than-light age. Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely flexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the ribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout the city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly and noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human—Cassal shivered. If he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No investigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had certainly picked the right place. The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal was almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by. What she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out. \"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at closer range.\""}

{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_3#0", "contents": "Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive in an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful out of her element, though. The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow, physically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with it. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A scientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder. \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got close. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed. Anticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans. That makes the knife definite.\" Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal stopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter. \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything on this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted intersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\" The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said Cassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on getting back to the hotel?\" \"I'm curious. Turn here.\" \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that intersection, he turned there. It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily slow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on the other. He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all very well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was also the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an electronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that. \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking fast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\" \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased. Not just now.\" \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism concealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued: \"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like this, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is critical.\" \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand. He clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness assumed an even more sinister quality. \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\" \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask me for a light.\" \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I hate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\" \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't there any clue?\" \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn around.\""}

{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_4#0", "contents": "Cassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him feel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little. A dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the alley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant shot by. \"Hey!\" shouted Cassal. Echoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling that no one was going to come to his assistance. \"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he missed. He's turned around and is coming back.\" \"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal. \"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\" Cassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few seconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected stiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical instrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its function, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto. \"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but he can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare. What he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep you posted below the level of his hearing.\" \"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against the wall. \"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet. Low.\" Sickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of a miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately, his estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance, the soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His opponent gasped and broke away. \"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got him. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's afraid.\" Attack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some didn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent fell to the ground, gasped and was silent. Cassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near the water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't move. \"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely perceptible.\" \"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief. Foam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed from cuts on the face. \"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_5#0", "contents": "Horrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but would the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to investigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would question him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what could he do about it? Suppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney 21? Grimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of this. Why had the man attacked? What did he want? \"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body data—a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\" Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles of no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount of money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A picture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which resembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all. Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed to be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of getting to Tunney 21. Right now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the boulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence. He bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him. Before he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly trying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he was forced to the ground. He threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps rushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping by way of water. Whoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in sight. \"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man I've ever been strangled by.\" \"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the basic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I checked him, he had no heartbeat.\" \"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted Cassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't wanted to kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the police. He needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second time he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was successful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He squeezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away. Something, however, was missing—his wallet. The thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle. Persistent fellow. Damned persistent. It really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the supposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police. Now he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It contained more money than his wallet had. Except for the identification tab he always carried"}

Now he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It contained more money than his wallet had. Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it was more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece of plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he now had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for another tab. A white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell. Curiously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word, STAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_6#0", "contents": "The old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling precariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the door disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The technician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed on the door. TRAVELERS AID BUREAU Murra Foray, First Counselor It was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The old technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again. With a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed help and he had to find it in this dingy rathole. Inside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a maze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable. Travelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he managed to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms. A woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer everything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be available for consultation.\" Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he asked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\" \"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily. \"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\" \"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to the first counselor.\" \"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the screen. Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression. Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly supplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him, Cassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of him. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and answers. One thing he drew the line at—why he wanted to go to Tunney 21 was his own business. The first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed, that anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average, rather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the chin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_7#0", "contents": "She glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth. Destination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales engineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior. \"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of customer relations.\" \"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows arched. \"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\" \"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\" He could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't. \"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can guess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study under them.\" Close—but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not necessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could build Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even less likely. There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21 that Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies that had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he could help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that could build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag could set its own price, which could be control of all communications, transport, trade—a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of all that. His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher to come to Earth, if he could . Literally, he had to guess the Tunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition, the reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their arrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working for ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as Dimanche was a key factor. Her voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\" \"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've been here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney 21.\" \"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the screen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \" Rickrock C arrived yesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\" \"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will the next ship arrive?\" \"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked. He didn't answer."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_8#0", "contents": "\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation, is near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've covered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything within a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer distances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly, Cassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on or near Godolph. Within the next five years—maybe.\""}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_9#0", "contents": "He blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local transportation, star-hopping?\" \"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\" \"I don't need that kind of luck.\" \"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the emphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help you. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification tab.\" \"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual speaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood made in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it plainly, because it was virtually inside his ear. Cassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it with me. In fact, I may have lost it.\" She smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any part of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier for us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't remember your real name and where you put your identification—\" She arose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\" He glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His real name! \"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\" Presently she returned. \"I have news for you, whoever you are.\" \"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you don't believe it, send back to—\" He stopped. It had taken him four months to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for a ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances such as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for anything. \"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The spaceport records indicate that when Rickrock C took off this morning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\" \"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who had tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became clear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten it. \"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to understand what galactic travel entails.\" Outsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second transfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond the first ring, called Rimmers? Probably."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_10#0", "contents": "She was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without stopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is impossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken off a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently needed elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years pass before he learns it's never coming. \"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't vanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend on ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time, credit established, lost identification replaced—\" \"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any trouble.\" She seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was more congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited number of ships and using statistical probability as a guide—why, no man would arrive at his predetermined destination. But that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare galactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a giant room. Or could you? For the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship, was the comparison too apt? It might be. \"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to be settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused. \"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third ring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They don't encourage immigration.\" In effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a passenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of having a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when his money was gone. Cassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring. \"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\" \"I won't,\" he promised grimly."}
{"chunk_id": "DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_11#0", "contents": "The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his estimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he. Nothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that he was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first counselor. \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is special, though—\" \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\" She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that you'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum that would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any appreciable time. He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always work, if I have to.\" \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do business with Godolphians.\" Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully. \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special knowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly—\" He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The instrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large. From the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that information at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he could get. Dimanche was his special advantage. \"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can always find something in that line.\" \"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the Milky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't yet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better as a salesman.\" He got up, glowering. \"If that's all—\" \"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot provided for that purpose as you leave.\" A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle, swung open. The agency was efficient. \"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is hard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\" He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was also eminently practical. The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable contribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the bureau."}

He rolled the currency into a neat bundle, attached his name, and dropped it into the chute. \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\" \"What's a Huntner?\" \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing about her home planet when I managed to locate her.\" \"Any other information?\" \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached her. I got out as fast as I could.\" \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless, it sounded depressing. \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as electronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\" Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly inquisitive at times. Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on the other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man was staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed every sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was removing the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him. He turned and peered. \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged. \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting for my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions. \"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency. Why did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency were new.\" The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor resigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one didn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\" She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\" The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed overcome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away. Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job, afraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He shrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but he didn't intend to depend on that alone."}

His father smiled thinly. \"What?\" he asked patronizingly. \"I'm a rocket pilot,\" the boy said, his thin jaw stretching the skin of his cheeks. His father laughed in the way the boy had learned to anticipate and hate. \"Yeah,\" he said. He leaned back in his chair and laughed so hard that the Sunday paper slipped off his wide lap and fell to the floor with an unnoticed stiff rustle. \"A rocket pilot!\" His father's derision hooted through the quiet parlor. \"A ro— oh, no! —a rocket pilot !\" The boy stared silently at the convulsed figure in the chair. His lips fell into a set white bar, and the corners of his jaws bulged with the tension in their muscles. Suddenly, he turned on his heel and stalked out of the parlor, through the hall, out the front door, to the porch. He stopped there, hesitating a little. \" Marty! \" His father's shout followed him out of the parlor. It seemed to act like a hand between the shoulder-blades, because the boy almost ran as he got down the porch stairs. \"What is it, Howard?\" Marty's mother asked in a worried voice as she came in from the kitchen, her damp hands rubbing themselves dry against the sides of her housedress. \"Crazy kid,\" Howard Isherwood muttered. He stared at the figure of his son as the boy reached the end of the walk and turned off into the street. \" Come back here! \" he shouted. \"A rocket pilot,\" he cursed under his breath. \"What's the kid been reading? Claiming he's a rocket pilot!\" Margaret Isherwood's brow furrowed into a faint, bewildered frown. \"But—isn't he a little young? I know they're teaching some very odd things in high schools these days, but it seems to me....\" \"Oh, for Pete's sake, Marge, there aren't even any rockets yet! Come back here, you idiot! \" Howard Isherwood was standing on his porch, his clenched fists trembling at the ends of his stiffly-held arms. \"Are you sure, Howard?\" his wife asked faintly. \"Yes, I'm sure !\" \"But, where's he going?\" \" Stop that! Get off that bus! YOU hear me? Marty?\" \" Howard! Stop acting like a child and talk to me! Where is that boy going?\" Howard Isherwood, stocky, red-faced, forty-seven, and defeated, turned away from the retreating bus and looked at his wife. \"I don't know,\" he told her bitterly, between rushes of air into his jerkily heaving lungs. \"Maybe, the moon,\" he told her sarcastically.

This program is just like the others you've followed for nine semesters; nothing but math and engineering. You've taken just about every undergrad course there is in those fields. How long are you going to keep this up?\" \"I'm signed up for Astronomy 101,\" Isherwood pointed out. The faculty advisor snorted. \"A snap course. A breather, after you've studied the same stuff in Celestial Navigation. What's the matter, Ish? Scared of liberal arts?\" Isherwood shook his head. \"Uh-unh. Not interested. No time. And that Astronomy course isn't a breather. Different slant from Cee Nav—they won't be talking about stars as check points, but as things in themselves.\" Something seemed to flicker across his face as he said it. The advisor missed it; he was too engrossed in his argument. \"Still a snap. What's the difference, how you look at a star?\" Isherwood almost winced. \"Call it a hobby,\" he said. He looked down at his watch. \"Come on, Dave. You're not going to convince me. You haven't convinced me any of the other times, either, so you might as well give up, don't you think? I've got a half hour before I go on the job. Let's go get some beer.\" The advisor, not much older than Isherwood, shrugged, defeated. \"Crazy,\" he muttered. But it was a hot day, and he was as thirsty as the next man. The bar was air conditioned. The advisor shivered, half grinned, and softly quoted: \"Though I go bare, take ye no care, I am nothing a-cold; I stuff my skin so full within Of jolly good ale and old.\" \"Huh?\" Ish was wearing the look with which he always reacted to the unfamiliar. The advisor lifted two fingers to the bartender and shrugged. \"It's a poem; about four hundred years old, as a matter of fact.\" \"Oh.\" \"Don't you give a damn?\" the advisor asked, with some peevishness. Ish laughed shortly, without embarrassment. \"Sorry, Dave, but no. It's not my racket.\" The advisor cramped his hand a little too tightly around his glass. \"Strictly a specialist, huh?\" Ish nodded. \"Call it that.\" \"But what , for Pete's sake? What is this crazy specialty that blinds you to all the fine things that man has done?\" Ish took a swallow of his beer. \"Well, now, if I was a poet, I'd say it was the finest thing that man has ever done.\" The advisor's lips twisted in derision. \"That's pretty fanatical, isn't it?\" \"Uh-huh.\" Ish waved to the bartender for refills."}

Call this low?\" Ish teased. \"Here. Let's drop it a little, and you'll really get an idea of how fast we're going.\" He nudged the wheel forward, and the Navion dipped its nose in a shallow dive, flattening out thirty feet above the mangrove. The swamp howled with the chug of the dancing pistons and the claw of the propeller at the protesting air, and, from the cockpit, the Everglades resolved into a dirty-green blur that rocketed backward into the slipstream. \"Marty!\" Ish chuckled again. He couldn't have held the ship down much longer, anyway. He tugged back on the wheel suddenly, targeting a cumulous bank with his spinner. His lips peeled back from his teeth, and his jaw set. The Navion went up at the clouds, her engine turning over as fast as it could, her wings cushioned on the rising thrust of another thermal. And, suddenly, it was as if there were no girl beside him, to be teased, and no air to rock the wings—there were no wings. His face lost all expression. Faint beads of sweat broke out above his eyes and under his nose. \"Up,\" he grunted through his clenched teeth. His fists locked on the wheel. \"Up!\" The Navion broke through the cloud, kept going. \"Up.\" If he listened closely, in just the right way, he could almost hear ... \"Marty!\" ... the rumble of a louder, prouder engine than the Earth had ever known. He sighed, the breath whispering through his parting teeth, and the aircraft leveled off as he pushed at the wheel with suddenly lax hands. Still half-lost, he turned and looked at the white-faced girl. \"Scare you—?\" he asked gently. She nodded. Her fingertips were trembling on his forearm. \"Me too,\" he said. \"Lost my head.

You're dead broke, a widow, and with a funeral to pay for. The only smart thing to do is wait a while.\" Nan's eyes clouded, and her lips trembled. \"That's what I've been trying to say. Why do you have to win the Vandenberg Cup next week? Why can't you sell the Foo and go into some kind of business? You're a trained pilot.\" He had been standing in front of her with his body unconsciously tense from the strain of trying to make her understand. Now he relaxed—more—he slumped—and something began to die in his face, and the first faint lines crept in to show that after it had died, it would not return to life, but would fossilize, leaving his features in the almost unreadable mask that the newspapers would come to know. \"I'm a good bit more than a trained pilot,\" he said quietly. \"The Foo Is a means to an end. After I win the Vandenberg Cup, I can walk into any plant in the States—Douglas, North American, Boeing— any of them—and pick up the Chief Test Pilot's job for the asking. A few of them have as good as said so. After that—\" His voice had regained some of its former animation from this new source. Now he broke off, and shrugged. \"I've told you all this before.\" The girl reached up, as if the physical touch could bring him back to her, and put her fingers around his wrist. \"Darling!\" she said. \"If it's that rocket pilot business again....\" Somehow, his wrist was out of her encircling fingers. \"It's always 'that rocket pilot business,'\" he said, mimicking her voice. \"Damn it, I'm the only trained rocket pilot in the world! I weigh a hundred and fifteen pounds, I'm five feet tall, and I know more navigation and math than anybody the Air Force or Navy have! I can use words like brennschluss and mass-ratio without running over to a copy of Colliers , and I—\" He stopped himself, half-smiled, and shrugged again. \"I guess I was kidding myself. After the Cup, there'll be the test job, and after that, there'll be the rockets. You would have had to wait a long time.\" All she could think of to say was, \"But, Darling, there aren't any man-carrying rockets.\" \"That's not my fault,\" he said, and walked away from her.

He climbed out of the crackling, pinging ship, bearded and dirty, with oil on his face and in his hair, with food stains all over his whipcord, red-eyed, and huskily quiet as he said his few words into the network microphones. And he was not satisfied. There was no peace in his eyes, and his hands moved even more sharply in their expressive gestures as he gave an impromptu report to the technicians who were walking back to the personnel bunker with him. Nan could see that. Four years ago, he had been different. Four years ago, if she had only known the right words, he wouldn't be so intent now on throwing himself away to the sky. She was a woman scorned. She had to lie to herself. She broke out of the press section and ran over to him. \"Marty!\" She brushed past a technician. He looked at her with faint surprise on his face. \"Well, Nan!\" he mumbled. But he did not put his hand over her own where it touched his shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Marty,\" she said in a rush. \"I didn't understand. I couldn't see how much it all meant.\" Her face was flushed, and she spoke as rapidly as she could, not noticing that Ish had already gestured away the guards she was afraid would interrupt her. \"But it's all right, now. You got your rockets. You've done it. You trained yourself for it, and now it's over. You've flown your rocket!\" He looked up at her face and shook his head in quiet pity. One of the shocked technicians was trying to pull her away, and Ish made no move to stop him. Suddenly, he was tired, there was something in him that was trying to break out against his will, and his reaction was that of a child whose candy is being taken away from him after only one bite. \"Rocket!\" he shouted into her terrified face. \" Rocket! Call that pile of tin a rocket?\" He pointed at the weary Mark VII with a trembling arm. \"Who cares about the bloody machines ! If I thought roller-skating would get me there, I would have gone to work in a rink when I was seventeen! It's getting there that counts!

Fourteen hours, thirty-six minutes, and four days to go. \"How's it?\" the FS asked. Ish grinned and shrugged. \"All right.\" But he didn't usually grin. The realization disquieted him a little. \"Think you'll make it?\" Deliberately, rather than automatically, he fell back into his usual response-pattern. \"Don't know. That's what I'm being paid to find out.\" \"Uh- huh .\" The FS tapped the eraser of his pencil against his teeth. \"Look—you want to talk to a man for a while?\" \"What man?\" It didn't really matter. He had a feeling that anything he said or did now would have a bearing, somehow, on the trip. If they wanted him to do something for them, he was bloody well going to do it. \"Fellow named MacKenzie. Big gun in the head-thumping racket.\" The Flight Surgeon was trying to be as casual as he could. \"Air Force insisted on it, as a matter of fact,\" he said. \"Can't really blame them. After all, it's their beast.\" \"Don't want any hole-heads denting it up on them, huh?\" Ish lit the cigarette and flipped his lighter shut with a snap of the lid. \"Sure. Bring him on.\" The FS smiled. \"Good. He's—uh—he's in the next room. Okay to ask him in right now?\" \"Sure.\" Something flickered in Isherwood's eyes.

Ish nodded. \"How's that?\" The corners of Isherwood's mouth twitched, and he said \"Yes\" for the recorder's benefit. \"Odd jobs, first of all?\" \"Something like that. Anything I could get, the first few months. After I was halfway set up, I stuck to garages and repair shops.\" \"Out at the airports around Miami, mostly, wasn't it?\" \"Ahuh.\" \"Took some of your pay in flying lessons.\" \"Right.\" MacKenzie's face passed no judgements—he simply hunched in his chair, seemingly dwarfed by the shoulders of his perfectly tailored suit, his stubby fingers twiddling a Phi Beta Kappa key.

Ish answered him truthfully, without more than ordinary reservations. This was the man who could ground him He was dangerous—red-letter dangerous—because of it. \"No family.\" Ish shrugged. \"Not that I know of. Cut out at seventeen. My father was making good money. He had a pension plan, insurance policies. No need to worry about them.\" Ish knew the normal reaction a statement like that should have brought.

Suddenly, he sat bolt upright in his chair, and swung toward Ish. His lean arm shot out, and his index finger was aimed between Isherwood's eyes. \"You can't go!\" Ish was on his feet, his fists clenched, the blood throbbing in his temple veins. \"What!\" he roared. MacKenzie seemed to collapse in his chair. The brief commanding burst was over, and his face was apologetic, \"Sorry,\" he said. He seemed genuinely abashed. \"Shotgun therapy. Works best, sometimes. You can go, all right; I just wanted to get a fast check on your reactions and drives.\" Ish could feel the anger that still ran through him—anger, and more fear than he wanted to admit. \"I'm due at a briefing,\" he said tautly. \"You through with me?\" MacKenzie nodded, still embarrassed. \"Sorry.\" Ish ignored the man's obvious feelings.

No smoking, no liquor. I certainly won't be breaking any laws. One week. Get there, putter around for two days, and back again.

He looked up at the Earth, touched by cloud and sunlight, marked with ocean and continent, crowned with ice. The unblinking stars filled the night. He looked around him. The Moon was silent—quiet, patient, waiting. Somewhere, a metal glint against the planet above, if it were only large enough to be seen, was the Station, and the ship for which the Moon had waited. Ish walked a short distance. He was leaving no tracks in the pumice the ages had sown. But it was the way he had thought of it, nevertheless. It was the way the image had slowly built up in his mind, through the years, through the training, through the work. It was what he had aimed the Navion at, that day over the Everglades. \"It's not the same,\" he said. The Personnel Manager sighed. \"Don't you see,\" Ish said, \"It can't be the same. I didn't push the beast up here. There wasn't any feel to it. There wasn't any sound of rockets.\" The Personnel Manager sighed again. \"There wouldn't be, you know. Taking off from the Station, landing here—vacuum.\" Ish shook his head. \"There'd still be a sound. Maybe not for anybody else to hear—and, maybe, maybe there would be.

They were blue under the fingernails. He sighed, feeling the air moving down into his lungs. Stiffly, he got to his feet and began to climb into his G suit. The Moon opened its face to him. From where he lay, strapped into the control seat in the forward bubble, he looked at it emotionlessly, and began to brake for a landing. He looked for footprints in the crater, though he knew he hadn't left any. Earth was a familiar sight over his right shoulder. He brought the twin-bubble beast back to the station. They threw spotlights on it, for the TV pickups, and thrust microphones at him. He could see broad grins behind the faceplates of the suits the docking crew wore, and they were pounding his back. The interior of the Station was a babbling of voices, a tumult of congratulations. He looked at it all, dead-faced, his eyes empty. \"It was easy,\" he said over a world-wide network, and pushed the press representatives out of his way."}

He pulled a coverall out of a locker and climbed into it, then went over to his bunk and lay down on his side, facing the bulkhead. \"Ish.\" It was MacKenzie, bending over him. Ish grunted. \"It wasn't any good was it? You'd done it all before; you'd been there.\" He was past emotions. \"Yeah?\" \"We couldn't take the chance.\" MacKenzie was trying desperately to explain. \"You were the best there was—but you'd done something to yourself by becoming the best. You shut yourself off from your family. You had no close friends, no women. You had no other interests. You were a rocket pilot—nothing else. You've never read an adult book that wasn't a text; you've never listened to a symphony except by accident. You don't know Rembrandt from Norman Rockwell. Nothing. No ties, no props, nothing to sustain you if something went wrong. We couldn't take the chance, Ish! \" \"So?\" \"There was too much at stake. If we let you go, you might have forgotten to come back. You might have just kept going.\" He remembered the time with the Navion , and nodded. \"I might have.\" \"I hypnotized you,\" MacKenzie said. \"You were never dead. I don't know what the details of your hallucination were, but the important part came through, all right. You thought you'd been to the Moon before. It took all the adventure out of the actual flight; it was just a workaday trip.\" \"I said it was easy,\" Ish said. \"There was no other way to do it! I had to cancel out the thrill that comes from challenging the unknown. You knew what death was like, and you knew what the Moon was like. Can you understand why I had to do it?\" \"Yeah. Now get out before I kill you. \" He didn't live too long after that. He never entered a rocket again—he died on the Station, and was buried in space, while a grateful world mourned him. I wonder what it was like, in his mind, when he really died. But he spent the days he had, after the trip, just sitting at an observatory port, cursing the traitor stars with his dead and purposeless eyes.

Flowers, had stumbled onto a murderous plot more hair-raising than any she had ever concocted. And the danger from the villain of the piece didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the Spacemen's Club in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the shoulder. \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to thee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\" A woman here...! The Spacemen's was a sanctuary, a rest club where in-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another voyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly enforced. I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main lounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously. Grannie Annie! There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning on her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a voluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head, tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were planted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in calm defiance. I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I haven't seen you in two years.\" \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this fish-face to shut up.\" The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a friend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely againth the ruleth....\" \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no one there at this hour.\" In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey and Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed the drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions: \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't allowed in the Spacemen's ? What happened to the book you were writing?\" \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew this place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what they are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\" She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be Annabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels. But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.

But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel in the name of science fiction than anyone alive. But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount. One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime novels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a novel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag and hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two expeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto. She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known. \"What happened to Guns for Ganymede ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of your last, wasn't it?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_2#0", "contents": "Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly rolled herself a cigarette. \"It wasn't Guns , it was Pistols ; and it wasn't Ganymede , it was Pluto .\" I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe and beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\" \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have your hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\" Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her feet. \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the Satellite Theater in ten minutes. Come on, you're going with me.\" Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to the jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we drew up before the big doors of the Satellite . They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled colonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the muck, zilcon wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was packed with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity that made Swamp City the frontier post it is. In front was a big sign. It read: ONE NIGHT ONLY DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS NINE GENIUSES THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF THE SYSTEM As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a tinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the front row. \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of the players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go somewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the stage steps and disappeared in the wings. \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me yet.\" The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the stage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian sat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The Mercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably uncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new improved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an Earthman operator."}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_3#0", "contents": "A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and advanced to the footlights. \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce myself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\" There was a roar of applause from the Satellite audience. When it had subsided, the man continued: \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary to give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are nine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting sets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions. These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every question missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand planetoles . \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match her wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of science fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\" From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place on the dais. The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his dials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to coalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his voice echoed through the theater: \" Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury? \" Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her hand. She said quietly: \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed tracto-car.\" And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed, or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of the winner. It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had brought me here. And then I began to notice things. The audience in the Satellite seemed to have lost much of its original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the signal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete. Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a general surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips were turned in a smile of satisfaction. When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving crowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident occurred. A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by, dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an unpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of the Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to an earlier era. Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor"}

Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere, snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned into his mouth. Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to shout derisive epithets. Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place was all but deserted. In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober eyes. \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\" I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men ought to clamp down.\" \"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\" She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh line about her usually smiling lips. \"What do you mean?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_4#0", "contents": "For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back, closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming. \"My last book, Death In The Atom , hit the stands last January,\" she began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months' vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel. Well, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so for this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six weeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra Karn....\" \"Who?\" I interrupted. \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of Varsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about his adventures, and he told me plenty.\" The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she asked abruptly. I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\" \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active rock once found on Mercury. The Alpha rays of this rock are similar to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles projected at high speed. But the character of the Gamma rays has never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of Beta or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons. \"When any form of life is exposed to these Gamma rays from the Green Flame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of intolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate, a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\" I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word. \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long enough to endanger all civilized life. \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom followed.\" Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor. \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an old prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his travels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of an old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green Flames!\" If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed. I"}

The hold of that space ship was packed with Green Flames!\" If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed. I said, \"So what?\" \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean if it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets after the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in existence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble. \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made corking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after it was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on Earth.\" \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the conclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is attempting to put your plot into action.\" Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\" I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl and laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's your thief ... Doctor Universe?\" She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\" I shrugged. \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\" The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple quiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars, police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military dictator to step in. \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand times more potent and is transmiting it en masse .\" If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of approaching danger. \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up. Zinnng-whack! \"All right!\" On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the fresco seemed to melt away suddenly. A heat ray! Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the door. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old woman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and threw over the starting stud. An instant later we were plunging through"}

An instant later we were plunging through the dark night."}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_5#0", "contents": "Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last outpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as the eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick water. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray sky like puffs of cotton. We had traveled this far by ganet , the tough little two headed pack animal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have had its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force belt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to boatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy jagua canoes. It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her confidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City. \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find Ezra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to the lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You see, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the ship.\" Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi just before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer that broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an isolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had given me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control. Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe Grannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots which she had skilfully blended into a novel? Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its place a ringing silence blanketed everything. And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched it advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk. It charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat. There was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp talons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly, missing the thing by the narrowest of margins. From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress appeared. Grannie gave a single warning: \"Stand still!\" The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us again. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the air."}

This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the ground and shot aloft. Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed. I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me. \"In heaven's name, what was it?\" \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here in the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be trained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain and follows with a relentless purpose.\" \"Then that would mean...?\" \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the cafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her tent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is being watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_6#0", "contents": "The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the surface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of the swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive multi-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours. The Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his hand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in a matter of seconds. At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one of the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude jetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn. He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and unkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was dressed in varpa cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his head was an enormous flop-brimmed hat. \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss Flowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his hut. The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest type of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from civilization entirely. Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the object of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful. \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could find that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\" \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a cigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\" \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in Varsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\" \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\" Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by Earthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\" \"Dangerous?\" \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside of myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away because I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped because he made 'em laugh.\" \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face. \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction that's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them laugh, I don't know.\" Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut. Several mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the Venusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned. \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months. You gotta wait 'til I hear it.\" Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning"}

You gotta wait 'til I hear it.\" Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a chair, listening with avid interest. It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead my thoughts far away."}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_7#0", "contents": "Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me from turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning, that all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations. After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of steaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our advance on foot. It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he suddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him. There it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened arelium steel, half buried in the swamp soil. \"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled. A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern quarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And suspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white insulators. Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three Venusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will circle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\" But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence. Moments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship. A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel. Mid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door. \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to climb slowly. The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open. There was no sign of life. \"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed. Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the left side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was bare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking clarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we looked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles swing slowly to and fro. Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in the lower hold are probably exposed to a tholpane plate and their radiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\" Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the glass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact. \"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an atomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no guards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the Green Flames are more accessible.\" In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us.

Visible in the feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the vessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore. Suspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal plate. But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass. Grannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at the crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single move.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_8#0", "contents": "Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently unawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire and erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding desolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this time was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe and switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of the march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe program. \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once, but I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought to make him king or somethin'.\" For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped to her feet. \"Say that again!\" she cried. The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to make this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\" \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness and returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this is Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a method to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's hold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such a way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously. Don't you see?\" I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on. \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames radiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The Doctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but they were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations from the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and their wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic scale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\" \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\" \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial control of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius, Doctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the minds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames' radiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\" I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream. And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the tents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had dropped away to be replaced by another. There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the impression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And simultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the old prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly. An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was followed by another and another.

And simultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the old prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly. An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was followed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down. Opposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar punishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment. \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our only escape is to make 'em laugh!\" He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire. Abruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped and fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping jack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes. Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen blows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild laughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears. For many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was peaceful once more. Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want to go through that again.\" Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny sense of humor,\" he growled."}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_9#0", "contents": "Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes filled with excitement. \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop Doctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here. Right now we're nicely bottled up.\" As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz master on the screen. He was saying: \" Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of unparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow night I urge you, I command you, to tune in. \" With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the Venusians. \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\" She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled up her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship with bundles of equipment, she fell to work. Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled the visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup. Next she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought along as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects. She fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every twelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and fastened it securely against the stepto glass wall. Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she selected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity of wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and out, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus. At length she finished. \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll tell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow night, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme dictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship under full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast—the laughing of the Varsoom!\" \"You're going to what?\" \"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there. Visualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe makes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild peals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\" \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn. \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly. I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar Psychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that morning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly tried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter silence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the scheduled Doctor Universe program.

Read 'em something from one of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit up and take notice.\" For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her feet quickly. \"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from Murder On A Space Liner .\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doctor_Universe_10#0", "contents": "It didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this mad venture. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy of her most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted the ladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite search lamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circle of white radiance. Karn gripped my arm. \"This is it,\" he said tensely. \"If this fails ...\" His voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowly at first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more dramatically. And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening. \"... the space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot from the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control cabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free himself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to the gravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in mute appeal. \" A restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodies were surging closer. Karn nodded in awe. \"She's got 'em!\" he whispered. \"Listen. They're eatin' up every word.\" I heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere out in the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle, it was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another and another. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into the air. Ezra Karn gulped. \"Gripes!\" he said. \"They're laughing already. They're laughing at her book! And look, the old lady's gettin' sore.\" Up on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading to glare savagely out into the darkness. The laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after peal of mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in my life, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook her fist at the unseen hordes out before her. \"Ignorant slap-happy fools!\" she screamed. \"You don't know good science fiction when you hear it.\" I turned to Karn and said quietly, \"Turn on the visi set. Doctor Universe should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in as much of that laughter as you can.\""}

The Varsoom followed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen army in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did the last chuckle fade into the distance. All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently out before her. But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all sides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR UNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN AUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE. \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE JET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\" She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile. \"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't appreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell yarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background material?\" I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said. But I knew I would."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Winter 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes impassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed. Then he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape, and took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more. Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the translucent Dome—a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the stars shone dimly. Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he had another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass himself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city, after his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would not be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he had to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet Patrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country, and concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only safety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had to get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough. They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the crashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they didn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared raider in the System. In that was his only advantage. He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and then boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the short, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over the top of the ramp, and then followed. The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel. Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and started to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite young, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather, and a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw. \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\" \"I don't understand,\" Syme said. \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\" \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you. I—\" The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said finally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then—\"Okay, citizen, you can clear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\" Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes on the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next street he took a ramp"}

At the next street he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side a block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the intersection, and then followed again more cautiously. It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data, even the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands on it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite, glowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be imitated, and the only way to get it was to kill. Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The boy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation platform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in the transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the machine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket went into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator whisked him up."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_2#0", "contents": "The tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level of the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close overhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the platform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred a touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside. The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance away. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim, deadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the silent figure. It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by some slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still air. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift, instinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its silent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a minute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest. Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into his pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms and thrust it over the parapet. It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist. Before he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late, he realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's harness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was falling, linked to the body of his victim! Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm, felt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His body hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the corpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a little and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion. Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into play, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body. Fraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the sweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms felt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook slipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished. The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost lost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the spaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below. He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He tried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on the smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold on for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off. He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge at him.

He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken only a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\" Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other pulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed to get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety. \"Are you all right?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_3#0", "contents": "Syme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His rescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy hair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a humorous wide mouth. He was still panting. \"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his dark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\" \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I thought—you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly. \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand, and I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\" The man sighed. \"I need a drink. You need a drink. Come on.\" He picked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the elevator, then stopped. \"Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about that?\" \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it wide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\" They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a cafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just killed. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on the first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be found until morning. And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of culcha , he took it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There it was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even friendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was the culcha , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning he'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there were always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and it was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone. He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall, graceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat. \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped, caught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he said again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer, but you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment, but I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to tell you something, because I need your help!—help.\" He paused. \"I need a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\" \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG plate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting in its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their delicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk after them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow of culcha inside him. \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate. Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling.

An indefinable sense, a hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big was coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector. \"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\" Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms, he showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been right; it was big."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_4#0", "contents": "Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining city of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had risen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines, the artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly preserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many thousands of years. But they couldn't be reached. For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected Lillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis as it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both above and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew what had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of the present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew anything about them or about Kal-Jmar. In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth scientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it from every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots that still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they had tried everything they knew to pierce the wall. Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a bloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid dwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped in and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any Earthman to go near the place. Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate. Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical in properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a force that would break it down. And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four hours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme Rector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits on his sleek, tigerish head. Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild. For Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not occur to him that he had been indiscreet. \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better strap on your gun.\" \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\" \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and they think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns where there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that way.\" \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide—very interesting metabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and strapped it on absently. Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous hill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They eat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the deserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to xopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never come near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial. When the"}

When the first colonists came here, they had to learn their crazy language. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different things, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some, but not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\" \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously. \"They might do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\" The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars' deceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a wilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on sliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again on the other side."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_5#0", "contents": "Syme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared across their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow it?\" Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\" he offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we cross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\" Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he pressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail of the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep into the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike was in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over the edge. As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind revealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire cable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical incline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides as they descended. Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the metal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground again and the cable reeled in. Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But how do we get up again?\" \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want or have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that shoots the anchor up on top.\" \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my natural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of almost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his head. Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their harpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and the gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper blackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted, \"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever. The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the gully. Syme was saying, \"What—?\" when there was a thunderous crash that shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into the ground immediately to their left. When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread of the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition. Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate said, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and caught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully toward them. \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\" Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\" The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged.

Also like all Martian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs they did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or, more properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large as they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge that made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with a valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the bloodstream. Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the lips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black fur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of white were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise; or, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which helped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now they were mostly black. The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand car, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears, although some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to Martians. Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he swallowed audibly. One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and motioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and then gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience, could burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same spot long enough."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_6#0", "contents": "\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit, and Tate followed him. \"What do you think they'll—\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I know. They're unpredictable.\" \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car whooshed into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out. The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and started off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded along under the weak gravity. They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a half, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down it, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps, they could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker and more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine kilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture. The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a phosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't decide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though. \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He switched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane on the outside of the helmet. \" Kalis methra ,\" he began haltingly, \" seltin guna getal. \" \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not enough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\" Syme swore amazedly. \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme ignored him. \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said. \"But how—?\" \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on its surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to ignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for several thousand years.\" He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face was expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're right,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn is a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\" Tate looked interested. \"But why this—this gigantic masquerade?\" \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply. Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves because you—had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\" \"Yes.\" Tate thought again. \"But—\" \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our civilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours is an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you thought you were taking it from equals or not.\" \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with us?\" The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect. Unfortunately, you must die.\""}

{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_7#0", "contents": "It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet he could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep the Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian must have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood, holding himself in check with an effort. \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked. \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception of justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to know.\" Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of the cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the leader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away from them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to think about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like trying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\" Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently unconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why—\" he began. \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a very simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform Mars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\" \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim all along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then we'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out. You couldn't have that, of course.\" He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked at them with a queer intentness. \"Well—how about the Martians—the Kal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that one.\" \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a separate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our ancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\" \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make itself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves into cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to the new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem was an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for we progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained its slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes. \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural confusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\" \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with an—inferior—culture.\" \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said. Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged. \"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\" The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He looked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\" he said. \"I am sorry.\" Syme saw all his hopes of"}

Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before he knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the Martian."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_8#0", "contents": "It was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly strong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't tear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost feel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the swift pad of his followers coming across the cavern. He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every muscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with power. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's iron grip! He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the weapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped his lance and fell without a sound. The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way barely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and swerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of the weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor. Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the trapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely to let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped his body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His right leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And all the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths, seeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes, dodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of his powerful lungs. At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down the rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped the weapon from blistered fingers. He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from the seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency kit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out a tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing it impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the burned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid formed an airtight patch. Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind him, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I could have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even to save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\" Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He turned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly, but with his feral, tigerish head held high. He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed him with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something that shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and"}

Tate followed him with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something that shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and didn't know what to do about it. Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the same, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black suitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around to the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which might have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That was that."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_9#0", "contents": "They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to a fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they finally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was obviously exhausted. They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the small, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance of getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his eyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\" Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing above a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme. Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his mind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it receded into the back of his mind. \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again. There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon, and darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen tank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and started toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed again. Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their way past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters on all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning determination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they were. Journey's end. Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless admiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent, still their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made solid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the decay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and preserved for all eternity. \"Well?\" demanded Syme. Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black suitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it. Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile contrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It had a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of that tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling slightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him closely, his big body tensed with expectation. The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It looked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no power man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate that screen. Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately, and closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again. Nothing happened. The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever. There was no change."}

Syme stood stock-still but quivering with repressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud. \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The Martians knew—they wouldn't have tried to stop us if—Wait a minute.\" He paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike eyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists. Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough power to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically possible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set to open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power enough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if you'd built Kal-Jmar?\" Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years ago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five hundred. We can't go by topography. \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no one larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\" \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of Kal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest—as good as any other.\" They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his equipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until he had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a long breath, and closed the switch again. The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For a moment there was nothing, and then— Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed. Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing spot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a perfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening. \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\" Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the holster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he said again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum. I think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will close.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker. \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\" Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in Syme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He just stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face. Syme shot him carefully in the chest. He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead yet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of himself, Syme bent forward to listen. \" You'll be — sorry ,\" Tate said, and died. Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme straightened and smiled tolerantly.

Some detail he had forgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the man who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry! For what? Another dead fool? He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep lungs, stepped forward through the opening."}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_11#0", "contents": "The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode like a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of the whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only a corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright, glowing joy of conquest. The city was his! His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons, yet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for him. He was intoxicated. The city was his! There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing in the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him, the city blazed with treasures beyond price. It was his! The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a building. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for him. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on. There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was blowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he unfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a lungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a little heady; it made his head swim—but it was good air, excellent air! He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This room alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set into the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little things—a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that was as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor for—the artifacts, the record books, the machines! He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could take back only a little with him at first; but he could return again and again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore the city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An invincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps even a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away from Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy engine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain to take him wherever he chose to go!"}
{"chunk_id": "Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_12#0", "contents": "He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming with glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the container of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped them into his mouth. They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger. No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His mouth began to water at the very thought. And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme whirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was remarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled. But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in repair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent, and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not know, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak, and not the distilled liquor of the xopa fungus, which still grew in the subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving the mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse. And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the robot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its flexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before he could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood of xopa -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human beings.... Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the cold body of Tate."}

What with red-spot fever, talking cockatoos and flagpole trees, I was running in circles—especially since Grannie became twins every now and then.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] We had left the offices of Interstellar Voice three days ago, Earth time, and now as the immense disc of Jupiter flamed across the sky, entered the outer limits of the Baldric. Grannie Annie strode in the lead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place in this desert as the trees. Flagpole trees. They rose straight up like enormous cat-tails, with only a melon-shaped protuberance at the top to show they were a form of vegetation. Everything else was blanketed by the sand and the powerful wind that blew from all quarters. As we reached the first of those trees, Grannie came to a halt. \"This is the Baldric all right. If my calculations are right, we've hit it at its narrowest spot.\" Ezra Karn took a greasy pipe from his lips and spat. \"It looks like the rest of this God-forsaken moon,\" he said, \"'ceptin for them sticks.\" Xartal, the Martian illustrator, said nothing. He was like that, taciturn, speaking only when spoken to. He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third day on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us."}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_2#0", "contents": "When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction, visiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she was crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie, had always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've missed something. She's the author of Lady of the Green Flames , Lady of the Runaway Planet , Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast , and other works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are, however, they have one redeeming feature—authenticity of background. Grannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she laid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a transportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from visiting her \"stage\" in person. Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of Interstellar Voice on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another novel in the state of embryo. What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie had met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed her wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated to do the illustrations for Grannie's new book. Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the offices of Interstellar Voice . And then I was shaking hands with Antlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself. \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to persuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\" \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked. Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged. \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out here on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\" I scowled at that; it didn't make sense. \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities here at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix. It's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm not up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red planet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication. The Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts' transmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations per second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches middle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases. Then it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding apparatus, and the rush was on.\" \"What do you mean?\" Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained. \"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found. \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \" Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated .

Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that. However, the point is, between the properties of these two companies stretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric. \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees and a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has crossed the Baldric without trouble.\" \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers Park stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never saw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\""}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_3#0", "contents": "So now here we were at the outer reaches of the Baldric, four travelers on foot with only the barest necessities in the way of equipment and supplies. I walked forward to get a closer view of one of the flagpole trees. And then abruptly I saw something else. A queer-looking bird squatted there in the sand, looking up at me. Silver in plumage, it resembled a parrot with a crest; and yet it didn't. In some strange way the thing was a hideous caricature. \"Look what I found,\" I yelled. \"What I found,\" said the cockatoo in a very human voice. \"Thunder, it talks,\" I said amazed. \"Talks,\" repeated the bird, blinking its eyes. The cockatoo repeated my last statement again, then rose on its short legs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky. Xartal, the Martian illustrator, already had a notebook in his hands and was sketching a likeness of the creature. Ten minutes later we were on the move again. We saw more silver cockatoos and more flagpole trees. Above us, the great disc of Jupiter began to descend toward the horizon. And then all at once Grannie stopped again, this time at the top of a high ridge. She shielded her eyes and stared off into the plain we had just crossed. \"Billy-boy,\" she said to me in a strange voice, \"look down there and tell me what you see.\" I followed the direction of her hand and a shock went through me from head to foot. Down there, slowly toiling across the sand, advanced a party of four persons. In the lead was a little old lady in a black dress. Behind her strode a grizzled Earth man in a flop-brimmed hat, another Earth man, and a Martian. Detail for detail they were a duplicate of ourselves! \"A mirage!\" said Ezra Karn. But it wasn't a mirage. As the party came closer, we could see that their lips were moving, and their voices became audible. I listened in awe. The duplicate of myself was talking to the duplicate of Grannie Annie, and she was replying in the most natural way. Steadily the four travelers approached. Then, when a dozen yards away, they suddenly faded like a negative exposed to light and disappeared. \"What do you make of it?\" I said in a hushed voice. Grannie shook her head. \"Might be a form of mass hypnosis superinduced by some chemical radiations,\" she replied. \"Whatever it is, we'd better watch our step. There's no telling what might lie ahead.\" We walked after that with taut nerves and watchful eyes, but we saw no repetition of the \"mirage.\" The wind continued to blow ceaselessly, and the sand seemed to grow more and more powdery. For some time I had fixed my gaze on a dot in the sky which I supposed to be a high-flying cockatoo. As that dot continued to move across the heavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it. \"It's a kite,\" she nodded. \"There should be a car attached to"}

As that dot continued to move across the heavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it. \"It's a kite,\" she nodded. \"There should be a car attached to it somewhere.\" She offered no further explanation, but a quarter of an hour later as we topped another rise a curious elliptical car with a long slanting windscreen came into view. Attached to its hood was a taut wire which slanted up into the sky to connect with the kite. A man was driving and when he saw us, he waved. Five minutes later Grannie was shaking his hand vigorously and mumbling introductions. \"This is Jimmy Baker,\" she said. \"He manages Larynx Incorporated , and he's the real reason we're here.\" I decided I liked Baker the moment I saw him. In his middle thirties, he was tall and lean, with pleasant blue eyes which even his sand goggles could not conceal. \"I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, Grannie,\" he said. \"If anybody can help me, you can.\" Grannie's eyes glittered. \"Trouble with the mine laborers?\" she questioned."}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_4#0", "contents": "Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we headed back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an electric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these adjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the car's ability to move in any direction. \"If I weren't a realist, I'd say that Larynx Incorporated has been bewitched,\" he began slowly. \"We pay our men high wages and give them excellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year. Up until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and spirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.\" \"Red Spot Fever?\" Grannie looked at him curiously. Jimmy Baker nodded. \"The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness on the part of the patient. Then they disappear.\" He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass. \"They walk out into the Baldric,\" he continued, \"and nothing can stop them. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as they realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes are turned, they give us the slip.\" \"But surely you must have some idea of where they go,\" Grannie said. Baker lit a cigarette. \"There's all kinds of rumors,\" he replied, \"but none of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie ahead of us.\" I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between a rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of translucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were perched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but they didn't move. After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of Larynx Incorporated . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp, a door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was drawn. \"Mr. Baker,\" he said breathlessly, \"seventy-five workers at Shaft Four have headed out into the Baldric.\" Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely. \"Shaft Four, eh?\" he repeated. \"That's our principal mine. If the fever spreads there, I'm licked.\" He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. Silent Xartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got his notebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remained standing. Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself to the bottle of Martian whiskey there. \"There must be ways of stopping this,\" she said. \"Have you called in any physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send the men away until the plague has died down?\" Baker shook his head. \"Three doctors from Callisto were here last month. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away, I may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company is chartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means."}

Failure to produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose all rights.\" A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. A man's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said \"Okay\" and threw off the switch. \"The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric,\" he said slowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk. Grannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings. \"Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where that corridor is at its widest,\" she said. Baker looked up. \"That's right. We only began operations there a comparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix that runs deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of Interstellar Voice , our rival, in a year.\" Grannie nodded. \"I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run up there,\" she said. \"But first I want to see your laboratory.\" There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lower level where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the length of the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and began dropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or four Wellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a small dynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wire and other items. The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and the Martian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began to roll down the ramp."}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_5#0", "contents": "Not until they had vanished in the desert haze did I sense the loneliness of this outpost. With that loneliness came a sudden sense of foreboding. Had I been a fool to let Grannie go? I thought of her, an old woman who should be in a rocking chair, knitting socks. If anything happened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself and neither would her millions of readers. Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled. \"Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.\" A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a long corridor which ended at a staircase. \"Let's look around,\" I said. We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the second floor. Here were the general offices of Larynx Incorporated , and through glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines and report tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore was being packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end a door to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back in a swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel. \"C'mon in,\" he said, seeing us. \"If you want a look at your friends, here they are.\" He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent a slow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, then coalesced into a three-dimensional scene. It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from the rear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me, were Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standing directly behind them. \"It's Mr. Baker's own invention,\" the operator said. \"An improvement on the visiphone.\" \"Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and its passengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?\" \"Sure.\" The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voice entered the room. It stopped abruptly. \"The machine uses a lot of power,\" the operator said, \"and as yet we haven't got much.\" The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappeared somewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myself posted of Grannie's movements. Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. When we returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing. I went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face of Antlers Park flashed on the screen. \"Hello,\" he said in his friendly way. \"I see you arrived all right. Is Miss Flowers there?\" \"Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,\" I said. \"There's trouble up there. Red spot fever.\" \"Fever, eh?\" repeated Park. \"That's a shame. Is there anything I can do?\" \"Tell me,\" I said, \"has your company had any trouble with this plague?\" \"A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the other side of the Baldric."}

Is there anything I can do?\" \"Tell me,\" I said, \"has your company had any trouble with this plague?\" \"A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the other side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemists gave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think of it, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula. I haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have any trouble, I shouldn't either.\" We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactly an hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room. Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on their conversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular array of flagpole trees, with the sky dotted by high-flying cockatoos. \"There's an eyrie over there,\" Jimmy Baker was saying. \"We might as well camp beside it.\""}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_6#0", "contents": "Moments later a rude circle of flagpole trees loomed ahead. Across the top of them was stretched a translucent web. Jimmy and Grannie got out of the car and began making camp. Xartal remained in his seat. He was drawing pictures on large pieces of pasteboard, and as I stood there in the visiscreen room, I watched him. There was no doubt about it, the Martian was clever. He would make a few rapid lines on one of the pasteboards, rub it a little to get the proper shading and then go on to the next. In swift rotation likenesses of Ezra Karn, of myself, of Jimmy Baker, and of Antlers Park took form. Ezra spoke over my shoulder. \"He's doing scenes for Grannie's new book,\" he said. \"The old lady figures on using the events here for a plot. Look at that damned nosy bird! \" A silver cockatoo had alighted on the kite car and was surveying curiously Xartal's work. As each drawing was completed, the bird scanned it with rapt attention. Abruptly it flew to the top of the eyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird companions. And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A group of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and moving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world. With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw the image of Jimmy Baker. The real Jimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this incredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. \"I've got it!\" she said. \"Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images. They're Xartal's drawings!\""}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_7#0", "contents": "\"Don't you see,\" the lady continued. \"Everything that Xartal put on paper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos are like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power of copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental image of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a powerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is then transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common foci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain vibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light field to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.\" The Larynx manager nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"But why don't the birds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?\" \"Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and made a greater impression on their brains,\" Grannie replied. Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate of Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the image of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park. Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank. \"Sorry,\" the operator said. \"I've used too much power already. Have to give the generators a chance to build it up again.\" Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs. \"That explains something at any rate,\" the old prospector said. \"But how about that Red spot fever?\" On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened it and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been attacked by the strange malady. Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had received the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while sleeping or lounging in the barracks. Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that led to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low rectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds. Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those bunks some thirty men lay sleeping. The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood there, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk toward that window. \"Look here,\" he said. Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull metal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The central part of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as I seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work. All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red rays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to concentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork served a double purpose.

It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens slowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men. I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run. Back in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator: \"Turn it on!\" The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel. I stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, nor was Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the controls was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice."}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_8#0", "contents": "Ezra Karn jabbed my elbow. \"Grannie's coming back. I thought she'd be getting sick of this blamed moon.\" It didn't make sense. In all the years I'd known Annabella C. Flowers, never yet had I seen her desert a case until she had woven the clues and facts to a logical conclusion. \"Ezra,\" I said, \"we're going to drive out and meet them. There's something screwy here.\" Ten minutes later in another kite car we were driving at a fast clip through the powdery sands of the Baldric. And before long we saw another car approaching. It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her prim way next to Antlers Park. Park said: \"We left the others at the mine. Miss Flowers is going back with me to my offices to help me improve the formula for that new antitoxin.\" He waved his hand, and the car moved off. I watched it as it sped across the desert, and a growing suspicion began to form in my mind. Then, like a knife thrust, the truth struck me. \"Ezra!\" I yelled, swinging the car. \"That wasn't Grannie! That was one of those damned cockatoo images. We've got to catch him.\" The other car was some distance ahead now. Park looked back and saw us following. He did something to the kite wire, and his car leaped ahead. I threw the speed indicator hard over. Our kite was a huge box affair with a steady powerful pull to the connecting wire. Park's vehicle was drawn by a flat triangular kite that dove and fluttered with each variance of the wind. Steadily we began to close in. The manager of Interstellar Voice turned again, and something glinted in his hand. There was a flash of purple flame, and a round hole appeared in our windscreen inches above Karn's head. \"Heat gun!\" Ezra yelled. Now we were rocketing over the sand dunes, winding in and out between the flagpole trees. I had to catch that car I told myself. Grannie Annie's very life might be at stake, not to mention the lives of hundreds of mine workers. Again Park took aim and again a hole shattered our windscreen. The wind shifted and blew from another quarter. The box kite soared, but the triangular kite faltered. Taking advantage of Park's loss of speed, I raced alongside. The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could use it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and sent it coiling across the intervening space. The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only thing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a halt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free from his grasp. \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded. The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the trigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest. \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance"}

{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_9#0", "contents": "I leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now the country began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to group themselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, as if to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetrate that wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths. Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began again. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as granite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance black bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or doorway between. I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power with an exclamation of astonishment. There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was Grannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing. \"Grannie!\" I yelled. \"What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?\" She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock. \"Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers,\" she said, a twinkle in her eyes. \"I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot of trouble.\" She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve. \"Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.\" She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep gorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing close. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement. Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of Larynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down the center of the gorge toward the entrance. But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen had been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like contrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of bluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forth upon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian. \"Ultra violet,\" Grannie Annie explained. \"The opposite end of the vibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red rays that cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they've reached Shaft Four.\" Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four. We drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners always ahead of us. Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which if worked successfully would see Larynx Incorporated become a far more powerful exporting concern than Interstellar Voice . Antlers Park didn't want that. It was he or his agents who placed those lens buttons in the Larynx barracks.

Then suddenly becoming fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park strove to head her off before she reached Shaft Four. He did head her off and managed to lure her and Baker and Xartal into the Shaft barracks where they would be exposed to the rays from the lens button. But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague. Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in Jimmy Baker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie."}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLE_TROUBLE_10#0", "contents": "I listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished, \"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine laborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\" Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those questions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on this moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted himself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just what to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image. \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's diabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens buttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master controlling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners were in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would be susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you coming with me?\" \"Coming with you?\" I repeated. \"Where?\" The old lady lit a cigarette. \"Pluto maybe,\" she said. \"There's a penal colony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new crime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship, fugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....\" \"Grannie,\" I laughed. \"You're incorrigible!\""}

Svan was the leader making the final plans—plotting them a bit too well. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Winter 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock. There was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning perfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the same. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He turned. \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented. The OD nodded. \"I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said. \"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers ready to lift as soon as they come back.\" The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \" If they come back.\" \"Is there any question?\" The Exec shrugged. \"I don't know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny place. I don't trust the natives.\" Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they're human beings, just like us—\" \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don't like them.\" \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate themselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.\" The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of guards. \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives. They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we know Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that is—right down into the mud. Well—\" he laughed—\"maybe they will. After all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of—\" The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic voice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\" Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it. \"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly and went out."}

{"chunk_id": "DOUBLECROSS_2#0", "contents": "\"You see?\" Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five others in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\" The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her head. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\" Svan laughed harshly. \" They don't think so. You heard them. We are not human any more. The officer said it.\" The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she agreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\" Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still object?\" The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly convinced by Svan. \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\" \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\" Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of assent. \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not return.\" An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he complained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\" Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to Earth.\" \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council authorized—murder?\" Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the Earth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you object?\" Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was dull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked. Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his feet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the ship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the surface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\" He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty, irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a mark on one of them, held it up. \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\" No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that bowl.\""}

It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it with his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said. She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their slips. Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them. \"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation. The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough, after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\" There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\" Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled. Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over, striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing.... And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance. Almost he was disappointed. Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen one to announce it—a second, ten seconds.... Then gray understanding came to him. A traitor! his subconscious whispered. A coward! He stared at them in a new light, saw their indecision magnified, became opposition. Svan thought faster than ever"}

If there was a coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision. Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly beneath the table, marked his own slip. In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in secret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\""}

We have ample time.\" He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered. Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men? The right answer leaped up at him. They all are , he thought. Not one of them understands what this means. They're afraid. He clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was driving. \"Let's get this done with.\" She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite dark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them, illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done. A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence that followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: \"Halt!\" The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again. \"Where are you going?\" he growled. Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard it was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is that not permitted?\" The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\" Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It is urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a complicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\" Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced by a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared. \"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\" He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining. He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength in his body.

The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had ruthlessly pounded it against the road. Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally. Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously, then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be no trace. Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep a watch for other guards.\""}

Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness. \"Can't see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away at the computer's table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\" The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of course, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.\" Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no answer in his stolid face. \"Don't joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose something happens to the delegation?\" \"Then we're in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for the last three hundred years.\" \"It isn't all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they've doubled the guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they know how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this secret group they call the Council.\" \"And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?\" the Exec retorted. \"They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone out now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be coming from the town, anyhow....\""}
{"chunk_id": "DOUBLECROSS_5#0", "contents": "Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed. Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been two bombs in the compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one. He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he said. \"They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\" Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back again,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\" Svan, listening, thought: It's not much of a plan. The guards would not be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a purpose. Aloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember, you are in no danger from the guards.\" From the guards , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a ground-shaking crash. Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting off the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\" \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached for him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said. \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around, sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again. Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean? Was it an error that the girl should die with the others? There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die. He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by its own fierce rockets.

They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the side of the ship. Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance. He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?"}

He spun around and was caught in the glare of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop. Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. \"Svan! They're coming! They found the guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan, with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came for you. We must flee!\" He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly. Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb in the car— \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body.... The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He's still alive,\" he said callously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won't last long, though. What've you got there?\" Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a connection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type, delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car, and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\" \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won't do any bombing now.\" Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered. The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder. \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It's poetic justice if I ever saw it. They had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of paper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don't get,\" he said. \"What's that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on it? What about it?\" The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had the devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over slowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\""}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I The horses and packs were loaded before we went aboard the scoutship. The scout bay is no more than a great oversized airlock with a dozen small ships squatting over their tubes, but it was the last of the Ship that I might ever see, so I took a long final look from the top of the ramp. There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our places in the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that nobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling lost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to me. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An intelligent runt like me. He said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get together when we get down?\" I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked him. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack he'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to come back alive.\" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went back to his place without saying anything. My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be telling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that scrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the meantime, I've got brains as a consolation. After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps. We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and then we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to leave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot. Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's the only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go partners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that crack about being a snob. The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact the Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was almost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council debate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was all right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us kids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going to drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much if"}

I wouldn't have known that much if Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council. I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody else was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when I said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that wasn't in public."}
{"chunk_id": "DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_2#0", "contents": "It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really, because I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me unhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month. Planets make me feel wretched. The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and calves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on a piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere and little grubby things just looking for you to crawl on. If you can think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty imagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I've been on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but not for me. We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it's only a thousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up a level or down a level and be back in civilization. When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the sea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested hills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They don't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his gear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still smarting from the slap I'd given him. In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see Jimmy—if he would get back alive. It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the nearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound like fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive. Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow for fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They do figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time you're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to the Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship is a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that something has to be done in a closed society to keep the population from decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to keep the population steady. I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be found at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes. Venie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start getting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next landing, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly.

It didn't have anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the bad moment any longer. The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird, and in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the color of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last. II The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the lights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in the dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach if it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in thirty gone. I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three things in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others. The first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot I could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to camp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces, though not with that meatball Jimmy D. No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take nothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from nobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting. I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to Year End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was spring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got back we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to look forward to. In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking animals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty good, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the best meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I wondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and they've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good that I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky. On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the hillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching it in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a hard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't identify. One of"}

Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't identify. One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when they dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the actual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on Earth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were established, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have draft animals. The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight, as well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything else in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies were planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that could have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have had to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll bet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses."}

I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined bend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There were five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures alive. They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and knobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for faces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were almost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They made a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded along. I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the men on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as cats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line and he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That one wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me. He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he had a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we reached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow me. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the face he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man looks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That was why I kept riding. He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head? There be escaped Losels in these woods.\" I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it was that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though. Generally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say anything. It seemed smart. \"Where be you from?\" he asked. I pointed to the road behind us. \"And where be you going?\" I pointed ahead. No other way to go. He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and Daddy, who should know better. We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd better ride on from here with us. For protection.\" He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a mouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether everybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International English spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit with him. One of the other outriders came easing by then.

I suppose they'd been watching us all the while. He called to the hard man. \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at all. We mought as well throw him back again.\" The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he expected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed. The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us to Forton for protection.\" I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving along and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes. I felt uncomfortable. I said, \"I don't think so.\" What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and reached for the rifle in his saddle boot. I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over with the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he didn't want to be fried. I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\" They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions. When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\" They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I could see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with narrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling tones said, \"Look here, kid....\" \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It surprised me. I didn't think I sounded that mean. I decided he just didn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot. After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the creatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get them now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next bend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and the creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road. I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my mind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes I even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels. III When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my great-grandmother brought from Earth.

The thing is that inside it, nestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than the last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time. My face must have been like that as I rode along the road. The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave way to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of the green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before hadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work. But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or something. I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody questioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving silently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've seen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back. Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received a jolt that sickened me. By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were cold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to a gallop. I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all stone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were no machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the edge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the window—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it. But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't see one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There were little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All the boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why Horst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but I decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the clocks tick on this planet. But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They swarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and four children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me then—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I closed my eyes until it passed."}

They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in their path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth had and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came. I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough foresight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some others like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I wouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me. What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up blowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The older people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the Council should know. For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt really frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I felt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I whomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head. I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk again. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's smart and brains I needed. How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method. For one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you want to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody? Who? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind up with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think of was to find a library, but that might be a job. I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the late afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was starting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the sky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what had gone wrong. I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal. The scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to drop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I triggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't know why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry. The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my head, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started bucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain idiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me overhead, I got a"}

As it skidded by me overhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours. Not too different, but not ours. One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and we wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that takes an advanced technology to build."}
{"chunk_id": "DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_5#0", "contents": "I felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to a campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't help but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent buildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more than a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof. I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man, his wife and their three children. The kids were running around and playing, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father came and pulled him away. The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said hello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I had two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until that moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these kids. Isn't that horrible? About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man I had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He had white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never seen before. When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered around. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the children tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go, so the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd accent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness, it seemed just right. It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in a house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a nice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony errand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the poor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the handkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her dear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to defeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home. I wished for the same for myself. The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids off to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the camp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I couldn't see far into the dark. A voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this one, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're not.\" Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the campfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the fire, and cut back to where Ninc"}

I decided that it was time for me to leave the campfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the fire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets and mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now what they used the high-walled pen for. I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the night. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take leave. I never got the chance."}
{"chunk_id": "DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_6#0", "contents": "I was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my shoulder and I was swung around. \"Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one who'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He was alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast. I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he went down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him and reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from behind and pinned my arms to my side. I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly hand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a lungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he didn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet and dragged me off. When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped dragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and I'll hurt you.\" That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd threatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things to do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight for that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said. The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting the animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him. \"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what we can use.\" The other one didn't move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing tone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally backed down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me being kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his bunch. But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under my jacket. Horst turned back to me and I said, \"You can't do this and get away with it.\" He said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of trouble. So don't give me a hard time.\" He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I didn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering. \"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed a courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or something stuffy like that. He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I knew I'd goofed. \"Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be"}

I be taking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to court and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving you your freedom.\" \"Why would they be doing that?\" I asked. I slipped my hand under my jacket. \"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the Ships,\" Horst said. \"That be enough. They already have one of you brats in jail in Forton.\" I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with all my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him. He said, \"The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out what this be for.\" He held out my pickup signal. Horst looked at it, then handed it back. \"Throw it away,\" he said. I leveled my gun at them—Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, \"Hand that over to me.\" Horst made a disgusted sound. \"Don't make any noise,\" I said, \"or you'll fry. Now hand it over.\" I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the saddle. \"What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\" \"I can't remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\" I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind and the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good enough,\" to the others who'd come up behind me. I felt like a fool. Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and said in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was natural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it until it cracked and fell apart. Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard that my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\" I said calmly, \"You big louse.\" It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut.

KOMETEVSKY'S DAY By FRITZ LEIBER Illustrated by DAVID STONE [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction February 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Before science, there was superstition. After science, there will be ... what? The biggest, most staggering , most final fact of them all! \"But it's all predicted here! It even names this century for the next reshuffling of the planets.\" Celeste Wolver looked up unwillingly at the book her friend Madge Carnap held aloft like a torch. She made out the ill-stamped title, The Dance of the Planets . There was no mistaking the time of its origin; only paper from the Twentieth Century aged to that particularly nasty shade of brown. Indeed, the book seemed to Celeste a brown old witch resurrected from the Last Age of Madness to confound a world growing sane, and she couldn't help shrinking back a trifle toward her husband Theodor. He tried to come to her rescue. \"Only predicted in the vaguest way. As I understand it, Kometevsky claimed, on the basis of a lot of evidence drawn from folklore, that the planets and their moons trade positions every so often.\" \"As if they were playing Going to Jerusalem, or musical chairs,\" Celeste chimed in, but she couldn't make it sound funny. \"Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is to end up in the orbit of Mercury,\" Theodor continued. \"Well, nothing at all like that has happened.\" \"But it's begun,\" Madge said with conviction. \"Phobos and Deimos have disappeared. You can't argue away that stubborn little fact.\" That was the trouble; you couldn't. Mars' two tiny moons had simply vanished during a period when, as was generally the case, the eyes of astronomy weren't on them. Just some hundred-odd cubic miles of rock—the merest cosmic flyspecks—yet they had carried away with them the security of a whole world."}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_2#0", "contents": "Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt that in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the charmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea, the sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they pierced. People must have felt like this , she thought, when Aristarches first hinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet was falling dizzily through space. Only it's worse for us, because they couldn't see that anything had changed. We can. \"You need something to cling to,\" she heard Madge say. \"Dr. Kometevsky was the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this might happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of the man.\" She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and anxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much worse. \"Of course, there are several more convincing alternate explanations....\" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that there weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated, surely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the Disordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance phrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist. And in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you admitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen holes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: \"Besides, if Phobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been picked up by now by 'scope or radar.\" \"Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?\" Madge questioned. \"Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but I think' I'm right.\" And of course she was. She swung the book under her arm. \"Whew, it's heavy,\" she observed, adding in slightly scandalized tones, \"Never been microfilmed.\" She smiled nervously and looked them up and down. \"Going to a party?\" she asked. Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket justified the question, but they shook their heads. \"Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,\" Celeste said, while Theodor explained, \"As it happens, we're bound on business connected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute a sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes. And since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're going to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical sleight-of-hand.\" Madge nodded. \"Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be off. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.\" She gave them a woeful grin. \"See you when the Earth jumps.\" Theodor said to Celeste, \"Come on, dear. We'll be late.\" But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. \"You know, Teddy,\" she said uncomfortably, \"all this reminds me of those old myths where too much good fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much luck,"}

It was just too much luck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World Government started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that couldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of things, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and—\" she hesitated a bit—\"complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where am I to find it?\" \"In me,\" Theodor said promptly. \"In you?\" Celeste questioned, walking slowly. \"But you're just one-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or Ivan.\" \"You angry with me about something?\" \"Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a crisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.\" \"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,\" Theodor told her warmly. \"You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to be punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from Heaven and all that?\" \"Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.\" Celeste smiled. \"I guess none of us realized how much we've come to depend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from under you.\" Theodor nodded emphatically. \"All the more reason to get a line on what's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically far-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory Perception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days there's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the planet. I'm going to present the evidence at the meeting.\" Celeste looked up at him. \"So that's why Rosalind's bringing Frieda's daughter?\" \"Dotty is your daughter, too, and Rosalind's,\" Theodor reminded her. \"No, just Frieda's,\" Celeste said bitterly. \"Of course you may be the father. One-third of a chance.\" Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. \"Anyway, Dotty will be there,\" he said. \"Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly seemed to need more sleep.\" As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of the path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted to the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon. \"Did you know,\" Theodor said suddenly, \"that in Gulliver's Travels Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two moons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately, too. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and literature.\" \"Stop being eerie,\" Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, \"Those names Phobos and Deimos—they're Greek, aren't they?"}

But then she went on, \"Those names Phobos and Deimos—they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?\" Theodor lost a step. \"Fear and Terror,\" he said unwillingly. \"Now don't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of major and minor ancient gods had been taken—the bodies in the Solar System are named that way, of course—and these were about all that were available.\" It was true, but it didn't comfort him much."}

I and my god-friends like to keep some of our thoughts secret, but the other gods have forbidden us to. A little smile flickered across the lips of the sleeping girl, and the woman in gold tights and gold-spangled jacket leaned forward thoughtfully. In her dignity and simplicity and straight-spined grace, she was rather like a circus mother watching her sick child before she went out for the trapeze act. I and my god-friends sail off in our great round silver boats , Dotty went on dreaming. The other gods are angry and scared. They are frightened of the thoughts we may think in secret. They follow us to hunt us down. There are many more of them than of us."}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_4#0", "contents": "As Celeste and Theodor entered the committee room, Rosalind Wolver—a glitter of platinum against darkness—came in through the opposite door and softly shut it behind her. Frieda, a fair woman in blue robes, got up from the round table. Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor kissed his two other wives. She was pleased to note that Edmund seemed impatient too. A figure in close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrows at the collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious, fateful temper of the moment. He took two briefcases from his vest pocket and tossed them down on the table beside one of the microfilm projectors. \"I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan,\" he said. Frieda frowned anxiously. \"It's ten minutes since he phoned from the Deep Space Bar to say he was starting right away. And that's hardly a two minutes walk.\" Rosalind instantly started toward the outside door. \"I'll check,\" she explained. \"Oh, Frieda, I've set the mike so you'll hear if Dotty calls.\" Edmund threw up his hands. \"Very well, then,\" he said and walked over, switched on the picture and stared out moodily. Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors, and began silently checking through their material. Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyes didn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeeded each other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently and switched to audio. At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and some irritation, but in a few moments they were also listening. \"The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbital positions of Phobos and Deimos—that is, the volume of space they'd be occupying if their positions had remained normal—report finding masses of dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are moving in the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished moons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the mass of material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists have ventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of the Disintegration Hypothesis. \"However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a marked lessening of tension. The finding of the debris—solid, tangible stuff—seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in which some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of the moons has been found. \"The rest will also be!\" Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor had switched off their projectors. \"Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimum of commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat to the fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled in churches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopter processions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding that instant preparations be made for—and I quote—'Earth's coming leap through space.'

They have also formally challenged all astronomers to produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strange book so recently conjured from oblivion, The Dance of the Planets . \"That about winds up the story for the present. There are no new reports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket ships searching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements been issued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics, Cosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and so forth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poem written even before Dr. Kometevsky's book: \"This Earth is not the steadfast place We landsmen build upon; From deep to deep she varies pace, And while she comes is gone. Beneath my feet I feel Her smooth bulk heave and dip; With velvet plunge and soft upreel She swings and steadies to her keel Like a gallant, gallant ship.\""}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_5#0", "contents": "While the TV voice intoned the poem, growing richer as emotion caught it up, Celeste looked around her at the others. Frieda, with her touch of feminine helplessness showing more than ever through her business-like poise. Theodor leaning forward from his scarlet cloak thrown back, smiling the half-smile with which he seemed to face even the unknown. Black Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong show of decisiveness. In short, her family. She knew their every quirk and foible. And yet now they seemed to her a million miles away, figures seen through the wrong end of a telescope. Were they really a family? Strong sources of mutual strength and security to each other? Or had they merely been playing family, experimenting with their notions of complex marriage like a bunch of silly adolescents? Butterflies taking advantage of good weather to wing together in a glamorous, artificial dance—until outraged Nature decided to wipe them out? As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come slowly in. The Golden Woman's face was white as the paths she had been treading. Just then the TV voice quickened with shock. \"News! Lunar Observatory One reports that, although Jupiter is just about to pass behind the Sun, a good coronagraph of the planet has been obtained. Checked and rechecked, it admits of only one interpretation, which Lunar One feels duty-bound to release. Jupiter's fourteen moons are no longer visible! \" The chorus of remarks with which the Wolvers would otherwise have received this was checked by one thing: the fact that Rosalind seemed not to hear it. Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible statement from penetrating. She walked shakily to the table and put down a briefcase, one end of which was smudged with dirt. Without looking at them, she said, \"Ivan left the Deep Space Bar twenty minutes ago, said he was coming straight here. On my way back I searched the path. Midway I found this half-buried in the dirt. I had to tug to get it out—almost as if it had been cemented into the ground. Do you feel how the dirt seems to be in the leather, as if it had lain for years in the grave?\" By now the others were fingering the small case of microfilms they had seen so many times in Ivan's competent hands. What Rosalind said was true. It had a gritty, unwholesome feel to it. Also, it felt strangely heavy. \"And see what's written on it,\" she added. They turned it over. Scrawled with white pencil in big, hasty, frantic letters were two words: \"Going down!\""}

{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_7#0", "contents": "Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've done everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a thorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally, is in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions are being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the evening—which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\" One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table. Celeste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that had engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms. \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly about the Deep Shaft.\" \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five miles?\" \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\" At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes went toward Ivan's briefcase."}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_8#0", "contents": "Our trick has succeeded , Dotty dreamt. The other gods have passed our hiding place a dozen times without noticing. They search the Universe for us many times in vain. They finally decide that we have found a door going out of the Universe. Yet they fear us all the more. They think of us as devils who will some day return through the door to destroy them. So they watch everywhere. We lie quietly smiling in our camouflaged boats, yet hardly daring to move or think, for fear that the faintest echoes of our doings will give them a clue. Hundreds of millions of years pass by. They seem to us no more than drugged hours in a prison."}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_9#0", "contents": "Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. \"We need a break.\" Frieda agreed wearily. \"We've gone through everything.\" \"Good idea,\" Edmund said briskly. \"I think we've hit on several crucial points along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of inconsequential material. I'll finish up that part of the job right now and present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?\" Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his cloak over a shoulder. \"I'm going out for a drink,\" he informed them. After several hesitant seconds, Rosalind quietly followed him. Frieda stretched out on a couch and closed her eyes. Edmund scanned microfilms tirelessly, every now and then setting one aside. Celeste watched him for a minute, then sprang up and started toward the room where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped. Not my child , she thought bitterly. Frieda's her mother, Rosalind her nurse. I'm nothing at all. Just one of the husband's girl friends. A lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world. But then she straightened her shoulders and went on."}
{"chunk_id": "DR__KOMETEVSKY'S_DAY_10#0", "contents": "Rosalind didn't catch up with Theodor. Her footsteps were silent and he never looked back along the path whose feeble white glow rose only knee-high, lighting a low strip of shrub and mossy tree trunk to either side, no more. It was a little chilly. She drew on her gloves, but she didn't hurry. In fact, she fell farther and farther behind the dipping tail of his scarlet cloak and his plodding red shoes, which seemed to move disembodied, like those in the fairy tale. When she reached the point where she had found Ivan's briefcase, she stopped altogether. A breeze rustled the leaves, and, moistly brushing her cheek, brought forest scents of rot and mold. After a bit she began to hear the furtive scurryings and scuttlings of forest creatures. She looked around her half-heartedly, suddenly realizing the futility of her quest. What clues could she hope to find in this knee-high twilight? And they'd thoroughly combed the place earlier in the night. Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she was seized by a horror of the cold, grainy Earth underfoot—an ancestral terror from the days when men shivered at ghost stories about graves and tombs. A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind—the unnaturalness of the way the Earth had impregnated the corner of Ivan's briefcase, almost as if dirt and leather co-existed in the same space. She remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted her first tug, like a rooted plant. She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally dwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused herself and started forward. Something held her feet. They were ankle-deep in the path. While she looked in fright and horror, they began to sink still lower into the ground. She plunged frantically, trying to jerk loose. She couldn't. She had the panicky feeling that the Earth had not only trapped but invaded her; that its molecules were creeping up between the molecules of her flesh; that the two were becoming one. And she was sinking faster. Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hip-deep, waist-deep. She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her body from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in the ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. And always the sense of the dark, grainy tide rose inside as well as around her. She thought, he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his briefcase and toss it away. She jerked off a glove, leaned out as far as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into the powdery path. Then the Earth mounted to her chin, her nose, and covered her eyes. She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed with her, making a little glow all around. She saw roots, pebbles, black rot, worn tunnels, worms. Tier on tier of them, her vision penetrating the solid ground. And at the same time,"}

She dropped from black soil through gray clay and into pale limestone. Her tortured, rock-permeated lungs sucked at rock and drew in air. She wondered madly if a volume of air were falling with her through the stone. A glitter of quartz. The momentary openness of a foot-high cavern with a trickle of water. And then she was sliding down a black basalt column, half inside it, half inside gold-flecked ore. Then just black basalt. And always faster. It grew hot, then hotter, as if she were approaching the mythical eternal fires."}

Then he saw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the blue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the tiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could hardly have been fifteen. The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious disappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These are thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension, and impulse traveling—a result of the unusual stresses of the time. Finally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe, especially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods' and in some way responsible for current events. \"It is thought—\" The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining casually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over for him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced, \"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of pomegranate juice.

It was Colonel Fortescue, a military antique long retired from the Peace Patrol and reputed to have seen actual fighting in the Last Age of Madness. Now, for some reason, the face sported a knowing smile. Theodor shrugged. Just then the TV \"big news\" light blinked blue and the girl switched on audio. The Colonel winked at Theodor. \"... confirming the disappearance of Jupiter's moons. But two other utterly fantastic reports have just been received. First, Lunar Observatory One says that it is visually tracking fourteen small bodies which it believes may be the lost moons of Jupiter. They are moving outward from the Solar System at an incredible velocity and are already beyond the orbit of Saturn!\" The Colonel said, \"Ah!\" \"Second, Palomar reports a large number of dark bodies approaching the Solar System at an equally incredible velocity. They are at about twice the distance of Pluto, but closing in fast! We will be on the air with further details as soon as possible.\" The Colonel said, \"Ah-ha!\" Theodor stared at him. The old man's self-satisfied poise was almost amusing. \"Are you a Kometevskyite?\" Theodor asked him. The Colonel laughed. \"Of course not, my boy. Those poor people are fumbling in the dark. Don't you see what's happened?\" \"Frankly, no.\" The Colonel leaned toward Theodor and whispered gruffly, \"The Divine Plan. God is a military strategist, naturally.\" Then he lifted the scotch-and-soda in his clawlike hand and took a satisfying swallow. \"I knew it all along, of course,\" he went on musingly, \"but this last news makes it as plain as a rocket blast, at least to anyone who knows military strategy. Look here, my boy, suppose you were commanding a fleet and got wind of the enemy's approach—what would you do? Why, you'd send your scouts and destroyers fanning out toward them. Behind that screen you'd mass your heavy ships. Then—\" \"You don't mean to imply—\" Theodor interrupted. The girl behind the bar looked at them both cryptically. \"Of course I do!\" the Colonel cut in sharply. \"It's a war between the forces of good and evil. The bright suns and planets are on one side, the dark on the other. The moons are the destroyers, Jupiter and Saturn are the big battleships, while we're on a heavy cruiser, I'm proud to say. We'll probably go into action soon. Be a corking fight, what? And all by divine strategy!\" He chuckled and took another big drink. Theodor looked at him sourly.

The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words: \"They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No! Please, no!\" Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at the same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an agent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an expression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She touched the child's hand. Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come awake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in a smile. \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then, after a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very queer.\" \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\" The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she asked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\" Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her face broke into a radiant smile. \"Of course I do, darling. I love you very much.\" Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again. There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste heard her name called. She stood up. \"I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others,\" she said. \"If you want me, dear, just call.\" \"Yes, Mummy.\""}

He looked more frightfully strained, they realized, than even they felt. His expression was a study in suppressed excitement, but there were also signs of a knowledge that was almost too overpowering for a human being to bear. His voice was clipped, rapid. \"I think it's about time we stopped worrying about our own affairs and thought of those of the Solar System, partly because I think they have a direct bearing on the disappearances of Ivan end Rosalind. As I told you, I've been sorting out the crucial items from the material we've been presenting. There are roughly four of those items, as I see it. It's rather like a mystery story. I wonder if, hearing those four clues, you will come to the same conclusion I have.\" The others nodded. \"First, there are the latest reports from Deep Shaft, which, as you know, has been sunk to investigate deep-Earth conditions. At approximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have encountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named the durasphere. It resists their hardest drills, their strongest corrosives. They have extended a side-tunnel at that level for a quarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible by the mirror-smooth metal surface, show that the durasphere has a slight curvature that is almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth itself. The suggestion is that deep borings made anywhere in the world would encounter the durasphere at the same depth. \"Second, the movements of the moons of Mars and Jupiter, and particularly the debris left behind by the moons of Mars. Granting Phobos and Deimos had duraspheres proportional in size to that of Earth, then the debris would roughly equal in amount the material in those two duraspheres' rocky envelopes. The suggestion is that the two duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes with such titanic velocity as to leave those disrupted envelopes behind.\" It was deadly quiet in the committee room. \"Thirdly, the disappearances of Ivan and Rosalind, and especially the baffling hint—from Ivan's message in one case and Rosalind's downward-pointing glove in the other—that they were both somehow drawn into the depths of the Earth. \"Finally, the dreams of the ESPs, which agree overwhelmingly in the following points: A group of beings separate themselves from a godlike and telepathic race because they insist on maintaining a degree of mental privacy. They flee in great boats or ships of some sort. They are pursued on such a scale that there is no hiding place for them anywhere in the universe. In some manner they successfully camouflage their ships. Eons pass and their still-fanatical pursuers do not penetrate their secret. Then, suddenly, they are detected.\" Edmund waited. \"Do you see what I'm driving at?\" he asked hoarsely."}

The thought that there are creatures in the Universe to whom the whole career of Man—in fact, the whole career of life—is no more than a few thousand or hundred thousand years. And to whom Man is no more than a minor stage property—a trifling part of a clever job of camouflage.\" This time he went on, \"Fantasy writers have at times hinted all sorts of odd things about the Earth—that it might even be a kind of single living creature, or honeycombed with inhabited caverns, and so on. But I don't know that any of them have ever suggested that the Earth, together with all the planets and moons of the Solar System, might be....\" In a whisper, Frieda finished for him, \"... a camouflaged fleet of gigantic spherical spaceships.\" \" Your guess happens to be the precise truth. \" At that familiar, yet dreadly unfamiliar voice, all four of them swung toward the inner door. Dotty was standing there, a sleep-stupefied little girl with a blanket caught up around her and dragging behind. Their own daughter. But in her eyes was a look from which they cringed. She said, \"I am a creature somewhat older than what your geologists call the Archeozoic Era. I am speaking to you through a number of telepathically sensitive individuals among your kind. In each case my thoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension. I inhabit the disguised and jetless spaceship which is your Earth.\" Celeste swayed a step forward. \"Baby....\" she implored. Dotty went on, without giving her a glance, \"It is true that we planted the seeds of life on some of these planets simply as part of our camouflage, just as we gave them a suitable environment for each. And it is true that now we must let most of that life be destroyed. Our hiding place has been discovered, our pursuers are upon us, and we must make one last effort to escape or do battle, since we firmly believe that the principle of mental privacy to which we have devoted our existence is perhaps the greatest good in the whole Universe. \"But it is not true that we look with contempt upon you. Our whole race is deeply devoted to life, wherever it may come into being, and it is our rule never to interfere with its development. That was one of the reasons we made life a part of our camouflage—it would make our pursuers reluctant to examine these planets too closely. \"Yes, we have always cherished you and watched your evolution with interest from our hidden lairs. We may even unconsciously have shaped your development in certain ways, trying constantly to educate you away from war and finally succeeding—which may have given the betraying clue to our pursuers. \"Your planets must be burst"}

But their thoughts were no longer of thirty-odd mile journeys down through solid earth, or of how cool it was after the heat of the passage, or of how grotesque it was to be trapped here, the fragment of a marriage. They were both listening to the voice that spoke inside their minds. \"In a few minutes your bodies will be separated into layers one atom thick, capable of being shelved or stored in such a way as to endure almost infinite accelerations. Single cells will cover acres of space. But do not be alarmed. The process will be painless and each particle will be catalogued for future assembly.

Only little Dotty sat straight and staring, speechless and unanswering, quite beyond their reach, like a telephone off the hook and with the connection open, but no voice from the other end. They had just switched off the TV after listening to a confused medley of denials, prayers, Kometevskyite chatterings, and a few astonishingly realistic comments on the possibility of survival. These last pointed out that, on the side of the Earth opposite the Pacific, the convulsions would come slowly when the entombed spaceship burst forth—provided, as seemed the case, that it moved without jets or reaction. It would be as if the Earth's vast core simply vanished. Gravity would diminish abruptly to a fraction of its former value. The empty envelope of rock and water and air would slowly fall together, though at the same time the air would begin to escape from the debris because there would no longer be the mass required to hold it. However, there might be definite chances of temporary and even prolonged survival for individuals in strong, hermetically sealed structures, such as submarines and spaceships. The few spaceships on Earth were reported to have blasted off, or be preparing to leave, with as many passengers as could be carried. But most persons, apparently, could not contemplate action of any sort. They could only sit and think, like the Wolvers. A faint smile relaxed Celeste's face. She was thinking, how beautiful! It means the death of the Solar System, which is a horrifying subjective concept. Objectively, though, it would be a more awesome sight than any human being has ever seen or ever could see. It's an absurd and even brutal thing to wish—but I wish I could see the whole cataclysm from beginning to end. It would make death seem very small, a tiny personal event. Dotty's face was losing its blank expression, becoming intent and alarmed. \"We are in contact with our pursuers,\" she said in the familiar-unfamiliar voice. \"Negotiations are now going on. There seems to be—there is a change in them. Where they were harsh and vindictive before, they now are gentle and conciliatory.\" She paused, the alarm on her childish features pinching into anxious uncertainty. \"Our pursuers have always been shrewd. The change in them may be false, intended merely to lull us into allowing them to come close enough to destroy us. We must not fall into the trap by growing hopeful....\" They leaned forward, clutching hands, watching the little face as though it were a television screen. Celeste had the wild feeling that she was listening to a communique from a war so unthinkably vast and violent, between opponents so astronomically huge and nearly immortal, that she felt like no more than a reasoning ameba ... and then realized with an explosive urge to laugh that that was exactly the situation. \"No!\" said Dotty.

On the TV screen, Celeste watched two brightly lit ships spinning in the sky—whether human spaceships or Phobos and Deimos come to help Earth rejoice, she couldn't tell. Dotty spoke again, the joy in her strange voice forcing them to turn. \"And you, dear children, creatures of our camouflage, we welcome you—whatever your future career on these planets or like ones—into the society of enlightened worlds! You need not feel small and alone and helpless ever again, for we shall always be with you!\" The outer door opened. Ivan and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly smiling, arm in arm. \"Like rockets,\" Rosalind blurted happily. \"We came through the durasphere and solid rock ... shot up right to the surface.\" \"They didn't have to take us along,\" Ivan added with a bleary grin. \"But you know that already, don't you? They're too good to let you live in fear, so they must have told you by now.\" \"Yes, we know,\" said Theodor. \"They must be almost godlike in their goodness.

It's knowing, I suppose, that—well, we're not alone.\" Dotty blinked and looked around and smiled at them all with a wholly little-girl smile. \"Oh, Mummy,\" she said, and it was impossible to tell whether she spoke to Frieda or Rosalind or Celeste, \"I've just had the funniest dream.\" \"No, darling,\" said Rosalind gently, \"it's we who had the dream.

They're gonna miss me at the palace.\" \"No, of course not,\" Sol said. He followed her into the darkened parlor, and watched as she turned the screw on a hurricane-style lamp, shedding a yellow pool of light over half a flowery sofa and a doily-covered wing chair. \"You go on up. I'll be perfectly fine.\" \"Guess you can use a towel, though. I'll get you one, then I'm going up. We wake pretty early in this house.

{"chunk_id": "dream_town_4#0", "contents": "They crossed the street diagonally, and entered a two-story wooden building. Dawes took the stairs at a brisk pace, and pushed open the door on the second floor. A fat man looked up from behind a desk. \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd see if you wanted to help move Brundage.\" The man batted his eyes. \"Oh, Brundage!\" he said. \"You know, I clean forgot about him?\" He laughed. \"Imagine me forgetting that?\" \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't amused. \"And you Prince Regent.\" \"Aw, Willie—\" \"Well, come on. Stir that fat carcass. Gotta pick up Sheriff Coogan, too. This here gentleman has to see him about somethin' else.\" The man regarded Sol suspiciously. \"Never seen you before. Night or day. Stranger?\" \"Come on !\" Dawes said. The fat man grunted and hoisted himself out of the swivel chair. He followed lamely behind the two men as they went out into the street again. A woman, with an empty market basket, nodded casually to them. \"Mornin', folks. Enjoyed it last night. Thought you made a right nice speech, Mr. Dawes.\" \"Thanks,\" Dawes answered gruffly, but obviously flattered. \"We were just goin' over to Brundage's to pick up the body. Ma's gonna pay a call on Mrs. Brundage around ten o'clock. You care to visit?\" \"Why, I think that's very nice,\" the woman said. \"I'll be sure and do that.\" She smiled at the fat man. \"Mornin', Prince.\" Sol's head was spinning. As they left the woman and continued their determined march down the quiet street, he tried to find answers. \"Look, Mr. Dawes.\" He was panting; the pace was fast. \"Does she dream about this—Armagon, too? That woman back there?\" \"Yep.\" Charlie chuckled. \"He's a stranger, all right.\" \"And you, Mr.—\" Sol turned to the fat man. \"You also know about this palace and everything?\" \"I told you,\" Dawes said testily. \"Charlie here's Prince Regent. But don't let the fancy title fool you. He got no more power than any Knight of the Realm. He's just too dern fat to do much more'n sit on a throne and eat grapes. That right, Charlie?\" The fat man giggled. \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes said. The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed citizen with a long, sad face, was rocking on a porch as they approached his house, trying to puff a half-lit pipe. He lifted one hand wearily when he saw them. \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes grinned. \"Thought you, me, and Charlie would get Brundage's body outa the house. This here's Mr. Becker; he got another problem. Mr. Becker, meet Cookie Coogan.\" The Sheriff joined the procession, pausing only once to inquire into Sol's predicament. He described the hitchhiker incident, but Coogan listened stoically. He murmured something about the Troopers, and shuffled alongside the puffing fat man. Sol soon realized that their destination was a barber shop. Dawes cupped his hands over the plate glass and peered inside. Gold letters on the glass advertised: HAIRCUT SHAVE & MASSAGE PARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody in the shop. Must be upstairs.\""}

{"chunk_id": "dream_town_5#0", "contents": "The fat man rang the bell. It was a while before an answer came. It was a reedy woman in a housecoat, her hair in curlers, her eyes red and swollen. \"Now, now,\" Dawes said gently. \"Don't you take on like that, Mrs. Brundage. You heard the charges. It hadda be this way.\" \"My poor Vincent,\" she sobbed. \"Better let us up,\" the Sheriff said kindly. \"No use just lettin' him lay there, Mrs. Brundage.\" \"He didn't mean no harm,\" the woman snuffled. \"He was just purely ornery, Vincent was. Just plain mean stubborn.\" \"The law's the law,\" the fat man sighed. Sol couldn't hold himself in. \"What law? Who's dead? How did it happen?\" Dawes looked at him disgustedly. \"Now is it any of your business? I mean, is it?\" \"I don't know,\" Sol said miserably. \"You better stay out of this,\" the Sheriff warned. \"This is a local matter, young man. You better stay in the shop while we go up.\" They filed past him and the crying Mrs. Brundage. When they were out of sight, Sol pleaded with her. \"What happened? How did your husband die?\" \"Please ...\" \"You must tell me! Was it something to do with Armagon? Do you dream about the place, too?\" She was shocked at the question. \"Of course!\" \"And your husband? Did he have the same dream?\" Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't you leave me alone?\" She turned her back. \"I got things to do. You can make yourself comfortable—\" She indicated the barber chairs, and left through the back door. Sol looked after her, and then ambled over to the first chair and slipped into the high seat. His reflection in the mirror, strangely gray in the dim light, made him groan. His clothes were a mess, and he needed a shave. If only Brundage had been alive ... He leaped out of the chair as voices sounded behind the door. Dawes was kicking it open with his foot, his arms laden with two rather large feet, still encased in bedroom slippers. Charlie was at the other end of the burden, which appeared to be a middle-aged man in pajamas. The Sheriff followed the trio up with a sad, undertaker expression. Behind him came Mrs. Brundage, properly weeping. \"We'll take him to the funeral parlor,\" Dawes said, breathing hard. \"Weighs a ton, don't he?\" \"What killed him?\" Sol said. \"Heart attack.\" The fat man chuckled. The tableau was grisly. Sol looked away, towards the comfortingly mundane atmosphere of the barber shop. But even the sight of the thick-padded chairs, the shaving mugs on the wall, the neat rows of cutting instruments, seemed grotesque and morbid. \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they went through the doorway. \"About my car—\" The Sheriff turned and regarded him lugubriously. \"Your car ? Young man, ain't you got no respect ?\" Sol swallowed hard and fell silent. He went outside with them, the woman slamming the barber-shop door behind him. He waited in front of the building while the men toted away the corpse to some new destination."}

{"chunk_id": "dream_town_6#0", "contents": "He took a walk. The town was just coming to life. People were strolling out of their houses, commenting on the weather, chuckling amiably about local affairs. Kids on bicycles were beginning to appear, jangling the little bells and hooting to each other. A woman, hanging wash in the back yard, called out to him, thinking he was somebody else. He found a little park, no more than twenty yards in circumference, centered around a weatherbeaten monument of some unrecognizable military figure. Three old men took their places on the bench that circled the General, and leaned on their canes. Sol was a civil engineer. But he made like a reporter. \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old man, leathery-faced, with a fine yellow moustache, looked at him dumbly. \"Have you ever heard of Armagon?\" \"You a stranger?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thought so.\" Sol repeated the question. \"Course I did. Been goin' there ever since I was a kid. Night-times, that is.\" \"How—I mean, what kind of place is it?\" \"Said you're a stranger?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then 'tain't your business.\" That was that. He left the park, and wandered into a thriving luncheonette. He tried questioning the man behind the counter, who merely snickered and said: \"You stayin' with the Dawes, ain't you? Better ask Willie, then. He knows the place better than anybody.\" He asked about the execution, and the man stiffened. \"Don't think I can talk about that. Fella broke one of the Laws; that's about it. Don't see where you come into it.\" At eleven o'clock, he returned to the Dawes residence, and found Mom in the kitchen, surrounded by the warm nostalgic odor of home-baked bread. She told him that her husband had left a message for the stranger, informing him that the State Police would be around to get his story. He waited in the house, gloomily turning the pages of the local newspaper, searching for references to Armagon. He found nothing. At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced State Trooper came to call, and Sol told his story. He was promised nothing, and told to stay in town until he was contacted again by the authorities. Mom fixed him a light lunch, the greatest feature of which was some hot biscuits she plucked out of the oven. It made him feel almost normal. He wandered around the town some more after lunch, trying to spark conversation with the residents. He learned little."}
{"chunk_id": "dream_town_7#0", "contents": "At five-thirty, he returned to the Dawes house, and was promptly leaped upon by little Sally. \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" she said, clutching his right leg and almost toppling him over. \"We had a party in school. I had chocolate cake. You goin' to stay with us?\" \"Just another night,\" Sol told her, trying to shake the girl off. \"If it's okay with your folks. They haven't found my car yet.\" \"Sally!\" Mom was peering out of the screen door. \"You let Mr. Becker alone and go wash. Your Pa will be home soon.\" \"Oh, pooh,\" the girl said, her pigtails swinging. \"Do you got a girlfriend, mister?\" \"No.\" Sol struggled towards the house with her dead weight on his leg. \"Would you mind? I can't walk.\" \"Would you be my boyfriend?\" \"Well, we'll talk about it. If you let go my leg.\" Inside the house, she said: \"We're having pot roast. You stayin'?\" \"Of course Mr. Becker's stayin',\" Mom said. \"He's our guest.\" \"That's very kind of you,\" Sol said. \"I really wish you'd let me pay something—\" \"Don't want to hear another word about pay.\""}
{"chunk_id": "dream_town_8#0", "contents": "Mr. Dawes came home an hour later, looking tired. Mom pecked him lightly on the forehead. He glanced at the evening paper, and then spoke to Sol. \"Hear you been asking questions, Mr. Becker.\" Sol nodded, embarrassed. \"Guess I have. I'm awfully curious about this Armagon place. Never heard of anything like it before.\" Dawes grunted. \"You ain't a reporter?\" \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I was just satisfying my own curiosity.\" \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked reflective. \"You wouldn't be thinkin' about writing us up or anything. I mean, this is a pretty private affair.\" \"Writing it up?\" Sol blinked. \"I hadn't thought of it. But you'll have to admit—it's sure interesting.\" \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly. \"I guess it would be.\" \"Supper!\" Mom called. After the meal, they spent a quiet evening at home. Sally went to bed, screaming her reluctance, at eight-thirty. Mom, dozing in the big chair near the fireplace, padded upstairs at nine. Then Dawes yawned widely, stood up, and said goodnight at quarter-of-ten. He paused in the doorway before leaving. \"I'd think about that,\" he said. \"Writing it up, I mean. A lot of folks would think you were just plum crazy.\" Sol laughed feebly. \"I guess they would at that.\" \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said. \"Goodnight.\" He read Sally's copy of Treasure Island for about half an hour. Then he undressed, made himself comfortable on the sofa, snuggled under the soft blanket that Mom had provided, and shut his eyes. He reviewed the events of the day before dropping off to sleep. The troublesome Sally. The strange dream world of Armagon. The visit to the barber shop. The removal of Brundage's body. The conversations with the townspeople. Dawes' suspicious attitude ... Then sleep came."}
{"chunk_id": "dream_town_9#0", "contents": "He was flanked by marble pillars, thrusting towards a high-domed ceiling. The room stretched long and wide before him, the walls bedecked in stunning purple draperies. He whirled at the sound of footsteps, echoing stridently on the stone floor. Someone was running towards him. It was Sally, pigtails streaming out behind her, the small body wearing a flowing white toga. She was shrieking, laughing as she skittered past him, clutching a gleaming gold helmet. He called out to her, but she was too busy outdistancing her pursuer. It was Sheriff Coogan, puffing and huffing, the metal-and-gold cloth uniform ludicrous on his lanky frame. \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed. \"Gimme my hat!\" Mom was following him, her stout body regal in scarlet robes. \"Sally! You give Sir Coogan his helmet! You hear?\" \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said. \"Why, Mr. Becker! How nice to see you again! Pa! Pa! Look who's here!\" Willie Dawes appeared. No! Sol thought. This was King Dawes; nothing else could explain the magnificence of his attire. \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily. \"So I see. Welcome to Armagon, Mr. Becker.\" \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped. \"Then this is the place you've been dreaming about?\" \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And now you're in it, too.\" \"Then I'm only dreaming!\" Charlie, the fat man, clumsy as ever in his robes of State, said: \"So that's the snooper, eh?\" \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled. \"Think you better round up the Knights.\" Sol said: \"The Knights?\" \"Exelution! Exelution!\" Sally shrieked. \"Now wait a minute—\" Charlie shouted. Running feet, clanking of armor. Sol backed up against a pillar. \"Now look here. You've gone far enough—\" \"Not quite,\" said the King. The Knights stepped forward. \"Wait!\" Sol screamed. Familiar faces, under shining helmets, moved towards him; the tips of sharp-pointed spears gleaming wickedly. And Sol Becker wondered—would he ever awake?

HINCKLEY It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister city of metal that glittered malignantly before the cautious advance of three awed space-scouters. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one usually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has occurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence at the city a quarter-mile away. He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the twilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the barren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they landed, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction. He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant. Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men, unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with a graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city. Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the stillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight sky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the city. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build a city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings. The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting geometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight, and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while this planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return in their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition had, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return flight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only city on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny mosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from the city a man moved, he would always be going north. \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused. \"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black pile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\" Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust cavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little, adjusting his radio. \"Worried?\" Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind of. I wonder what they were like?\" Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\" Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining metal band. Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away. \"It's here, too.\" Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell them we're going in.\" Rodney nodded. After a time,"}

After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\" Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it is—was—for.\" \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested. \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\" The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street, their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved cautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square surrounded by the tallest buildings in the city. Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not—not very big. Is it?\" Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the—well, shall we call them, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\" Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—\"Maybe they crawled.\" A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved slowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out—and the image faded. \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw. Then—\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light at all?\" \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly. \"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship, we're very likely to find out.\" Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\" \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin looked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past that out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat lay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow, from here, a little dim, a little hazy. He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that explained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was something familiar, yet twisted and distorted. \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\" \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here. What's the matter, Wass?\" The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\" There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—\"It's almost as if the city didn't want to be photographed.\" Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere along this street.\" Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal street, at right angles to their path of entrance. Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was almost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point being, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and subtle, things no man could ever"}

Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal street, at right angles to their path of entrance. Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was almost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point being, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and subtle, things no man could ever comprehend. Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere, sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the heavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before the thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he decided to grin at himself, at his own imagination. Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up Martin's spine. \"What's the matter?\" The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw—I thought I saw—something—moving—\" Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the other's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself, man!\" Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\" \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing from the other direction.\" Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That—\" \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios. \"Martin, I can't get out!\""}
{"chunk_id": "DUST_UNTO_DUST_2#0", "contents": "Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up. Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall.\" \"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are—\" \"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check here.\" Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving, toward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings. The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette. \"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must be all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences of this. Then—\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we separated.\" Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic through the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused this?\" He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it.\" \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\" Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\" Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\" Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\" Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\" Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're both wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\" Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at Martin. \"The wind—?\" \"Why not?\" \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood straighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer. They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass, and stood watching him labor along the metal toward them. Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\" \"The shield?\" Wass nodded. \"What else?\" \"I don't know—\" \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we might—\" Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to cover the city.\" Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it. \"I wonder where it gets its power?\" \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We may have to....\" \"What?\" Rodney prompted. Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\" He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall buildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and plain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately following his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the corridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and the streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into either side of the corridor. It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.

There were a multitude of doors and arches set into either side of the corridor. It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive. Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted downward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch. A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It looks like a switchboard.\" The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a great arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had come to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining through the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick rope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal roof. \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\" Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\" \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make assumptions ever since we got here.\" \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly. Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch. \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make. Rodney turned. \"But—\" \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\" \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\" \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the switch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly. He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you think you're doing?\" \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\" \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\" \"We've got to—\" \"No!\" Then, more quietly—\"We still have eleven hours to find a way out.\" \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the time it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet. And Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\" \"You too, Wass?\" \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\" Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always thinking of your own tender hide, of course.\" Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us that much less time to find a way out. Martin—\" \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you stand!\""}
{"chunk_id": "DUST_UNTO_DUST_3#0", "contents": "Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all have guns, Martin.\" \"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited. After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly, \"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\" \"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out of here, then!\" Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the metal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a halt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must be at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\" Rodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around the city would take years.\" Martin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level leading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\" Wass laughed rudely. \"Have you a better idea?\" Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That leads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for the dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\" \"You mean dig out?\" Martin asked. \"Sure. Why not?\" \"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no equipment.\" \"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\" Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea. Rodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in to themselves.\" \"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\" \"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added. Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp. The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet perhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort, gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the darkness before the men. At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city. Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example. Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down on them. Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in a circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up there?\" \"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with his light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to you?\" Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\" \"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole city.\" \"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my nightmares stay when they're not on shift.\" Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he thought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him silently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more so by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the three lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions, past something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another something which could"}

The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall. The edge of the city—the city which was a dome of force above and a bowl of metal below. After a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\" \"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said. Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was holding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\" \"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But Rodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then—\"I can't think of anything else.\" They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past the same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all looking different now in the new angles of illumination. Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall, matchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty triumph in the rear. Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he sighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at surface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and then when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for now. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn. But—The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd ever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and Martin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at some point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a sort of racial insanity. No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be. Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity, a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien metal, which was making him theorize so wildly. Then Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\" Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass. \"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding up the procession?\" Martin was silent. Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It was in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before a bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as the combined light of their torches would reach. \"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass. Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips. Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section of the bank."}

Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips. Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section of the bank. Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they wouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\" Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why not?\" They were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\" \"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by the deadline we may be eating these.\" Martin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us find a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no water.\" Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the gun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For a plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water. Maybe—\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"—only the little moisture in the atmosphere.\""}
{"chunk_id": "DUST_UNTO_DUST_4#0", "contents": "They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side, Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear. Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was loud and rather uneven in the radio receivers. Martin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to take off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\" Rodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin. Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without us and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate ourselves and God only knows what else and—\" He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch. Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away silently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches. The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of Rodney's sobs. \"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\" The slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as a last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die gradually—\" Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last resort. We still have a little time.\" Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight, now that he was up again. \"Martin, I—\" Martin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently. \"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this city somewhere.\" Rodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\" Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not looking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can leave the same way.\" Down the ramp again. \"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured. Rodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\" Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down, picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the present level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\" Eleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\" \"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\" \"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ... think it's the last.\" They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of artificial light on the bottom level of the alien city. Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about the floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are cemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled—\" \"Rodney! Stop it!\" Rodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\" \"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\" \"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps—\" \"They had a war,\" Martin said. Wass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\" Martin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built before the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I know?\" Wass turned, too, persistent. \"But the"}

Or maybe this was already built before the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I know?\" Wass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\" \"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient planet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock it off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\" They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow shapes, looking carefully about them. Rodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\" Martin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He added dryly, \"Use your imagination.\" They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again, uncertain. Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes. Wass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\" \"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said. \"I wonder what the pattern was.\" \"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later expeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\" Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then—\"Martin! Martin! I think I've found something!\" Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind him. \"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See? Right here.\" Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more from the floor. \"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of the same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk. From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped and turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over. \"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\" Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily—almost too easily—rotating the disk as it turned. Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed hinge. The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the six-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that drifted and eddied directly beneath them. Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone. \"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\" Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the opening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down. He was shaking."}

{"chunk_id": "DUST_UNTO_DUST_5#0", "contents": "After a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember the wind? Air currents are moving it.\" Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing. Then—\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\" Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him, otherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\" Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun loosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\" Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney and he, too, had drawn his gun. The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it, outlined in the light of two torches. For a little while he was alone. Then—causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney—a tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about Martin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight, obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange objects. Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering spirals. Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said nothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and now, himself. \"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance. \"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered. Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a torch swinging wildly on the end of it. The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently rolling mounds of fine, white stuff. Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip of the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the switches and blow yourself to smithereens?\" Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him disgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into the infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom of the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He stamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing jump. He sank no farther than his knees. He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest edge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long as we avoid the drifts.\" Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney. \"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and sank into the dust. \"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way, I'll go mine.\" \"Wass!\" There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening. The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied and swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were hard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves. \"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked. \"Of course,\" Martin growled.

There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination. The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously plunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times without number. Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours, Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\" Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his throat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust, his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed. A grate. Rodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\" Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now, Martin. I—\" There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate. The grate groaned upward and stopped. Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he began to scream. Martin switched off his radio, sick. He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall. \"Well?\" \"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't you answer?\" \"We couldn't do anything for him.\" Rodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\" \"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly. Rodney said nothing. Then Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\" Rodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't understand it all. But—Martin, dying alone like that in a place like this—!\" Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up toward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\" An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the edge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force shimmering, almost invisible, about it. Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship. Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members standing by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run toward them. \"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It was the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed."}

I In the dream I was swimming in a river of white fire and the dream went on and on. And then I was awake—and the fire was still there, fiercely burning at me. I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and conscious. I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to an unpadded acceleration couch—the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it. I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare, but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst.... There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was fading out again...."}
{"chunk_id": "END_AS_A_HERO_2#0", "contents": "I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a fracture. The left arm—well, it was still there, wrapped to the shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't complaining. As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the Gool—if I survived. I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at work. I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition—with a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull—I shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip from Belshazzar's CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was here—and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters. I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before. It was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the haggard look. \"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out there?\" I turned him down to a mutter. \"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for an answer—not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on: \" Belshazzar was sabotaged. So was Gilgamesh —I think. I got out. I lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the Med people the drinks are on me.\" I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would get his reaction to my report. I dozed off—and awoke with a start. Kayle was talking. \"—your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\" \"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled—or croaked.

But Kayle's voice was droning on: \"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack—and came to on the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there. \"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the possibility of—what's that term you use?—hyper-cortical invasion. You know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to pass the patrol line. \"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept the risk.\" \"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope you think of something? I need a doctor!\" Presently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and pretend—right up until the warheads struck—that I didn't know I'd been condemned to death. II I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I was acting under Gool orders. I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan, psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were mine, all mine.... But how could I be sure of that? Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of their tampering—not at a conscious level. But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I wasn't just any casualty.

Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion. And found it. As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried motivations. I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt. \" It is a contact, Effulgent One! \" \" Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the threshold.... \" \" It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating trough! \" A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the voices—yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought against the intruding stimuli—then yielded under the relentless thrust of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me—and then the hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg. My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought—and the world-ending impact as I fell. At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality lashed out again—fighting the invader. \" Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one! \" \" Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend the last filament of your life-force! \" Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering—at a conscious level. Watching the Gool mind, I learned. The insinuating probe—a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had theorized—was no more than a pattern in emptiness.... But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had been done to me. Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning themselves. Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable void—and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a glistening dark shape. There was a soundless shriek. \" Effulgence! It reached out—touched me! \""}

I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering. Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact, tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind.... I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a more favorable position. I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals—riches beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe cluster—those who remained of a once-great race—at a single feeding trough. They would spread out across a galaxy—and beyond. But not if I could help it. The Gool had evolved a plan—but they'd had a stroke of bad luck. In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough, perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage. Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see what I could steal. A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts, fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the concepts of an alien mind. I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine. I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its meaning exploded in my mind. From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of their kind. Matter across space."}

I can build it, though, using standard components, plus an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil—and a few other things....\" I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now. Kayle came back—and his answer boiled down to \"no.\" I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the ego-complex. I might have saved my breath. \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped. \"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to you well enough. I'm sorry.\" I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the problem at hand. I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring. And I had a few ideas. III The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized it was the routine DEW line patrol contact. \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee preparatory to picking up approach orbit....\" The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try. I closed my eyes, reached out—as the Gool mind had reached out to me—and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched keys, spoke into his microphone: \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\" I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line now, rapidly approaching atmosphere. \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am picking you up on"}

But I was clear of the DEW line now, rapidly approaching atmosphere. \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\" There was a long pause. Then: \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\" It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it dumb, and hope for a little luck. \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that, fellows. I'm a little banged up—I guess I switched frequencies on you. What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\" \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\" \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I checked in with DEW—\" It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the controls, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out— A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar screens blanked off.... For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up, over, buffeting me against the restraining harness. I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on the water. I would have to risk calling Kayle now—but by voluntarily giving my position away, I should convince him I was still on our side—and I was badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key. \"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\" Kayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You penetrated the planetary defenses—God knows how. I—\" \"Later,\" I snapped. \"How about calling off your dogs now? And send somebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other complaints.\" \"We have you pinpointed,\" Kayle cut in. \"It's no use fighting it, Granthan.\""}

Call them back! I have information that can win the war—\" \"I'm sorry, Granthan,\" Kayle said. \"It's too late—even if I could take the chance you were right.\" A different face appeared on the screen. \"Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and in the name of the President—who has been apprised of this tragic situation—it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor—posthumously—for your heroic effort. Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will, to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts from your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.\" The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture. \"Stow that, you pompous idiot!\" I barked. \"I'm no spy!\" Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general. \"Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....\" I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes. The missiles would be from Canaveral. I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out.... I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked through the cluster of minds. \"— missile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot. \" I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers. He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam his hand against the destruct button. Men fell on him, dragged him back. \"— fool, why did you blow it? \" I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel, detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew. I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now. I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next attacker. IV It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself. A few more minutes and you can lie down ... rest.... The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker square.

There was a startled exclamation. I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep— I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between the cars. I caught the clear thought: \"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right—\" I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled steer. It was easy—if I could only stay awake. I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide down into darkness."}
{"chunk_id": "END_AS_A_HERO_7#0", "contents": "The car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation at the treatment it had received—walking brace and all—and the burned arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a badly embalmed mummy—except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast. I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would have finished me—and the hapless fisherman—right then. We rode out a couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the air. At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car—with driver. He dropped me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me. Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of the farce. I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages. I needed new clothes—or at least different ones—and something to cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had recognized me at a glance. I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly worried—at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself. The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes and let my awareness stretch out. \"— lousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey.... \" I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign. I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged. My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped sandwiches under a glass cover. \"I'll take 'em all."}

And give me a big glass of water.\" \"Better git out there and look after yer train,\" the girl said carelessly. \"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\" \"Put it in a bag. Quick.\" \"Look who's getting bossy—\" My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \"You git back around that counter!\" She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear. \"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\" My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it up and started out. \"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\" The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard him say: \"Friend o' mine in there—just passin' through.\" I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would rationalize his behavior, fill in the details—and never know that the original idea hadn't been his own. I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \"U. S. Naval Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\". With any luck I'd reach New Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could wait."}
{"chunk_id": "END_AS_A_HERO_8#0", "contents": "It was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles in me. I had my supplies—a few candy bars and some cigarettes—stuffed in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right leg and the sling binding my arm. I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road, started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes. Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with black hair. \"Want a lift?\" he called. I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them. An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it. Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin tailor—maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret. The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a fisherman—I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house derelict. I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with a wart. \"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\" He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick. \"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\" \"I'm a tourist,\" I said. \"They told me before I left home not to miss it.\" He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without looking. \"How far is it?\" I asked him. \"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\" \"Pretty big place, I guess.\" He didn't answer.

I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low buildings. \"What's this?\" \"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\" I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew. He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me. \"You want I should drive in, sir?\" \"I'll get out here.\" He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good elbow. \"I'll get your change, sir,\" he said, reaching for his hip. \"Keep it.\" \"Thank YOU.\" He hesitated. \"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\" \"I'll be all right.\" \"I hope so,\" he said. \"A man like you—you and me—\" he winked. \"After all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\" \"True,\" I said. \"Consider your tip doubled.

He had seen the phantom—and lived. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Winter 1942. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's lips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his fingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the Mary Lou were now black as meteor dust. \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at the cover. \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man would not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping us drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and we'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed helplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use. The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His face contorted as he tried to withhold a sob. \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once more!\" \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt. No man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be anguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no man could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of the solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the stars. Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like Dobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from now, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in space and bring them home again. Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted him so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the stars. Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the heavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he first crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would die a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any man could. Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a tremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard. \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling. \"Saw what?\" \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\" \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is it?\" Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded space. \"The Ghost Ship!\" Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in whispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales. But he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of Dobbin's"}

He had heard it spoken of in whispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales. But he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of Dobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up in this time of delirium. \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly. \"It's come—for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward Willard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His mouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one with the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone. For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body of his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was necessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had ever had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the useless motors of the Mary Lou ."}
{"chunk_id": "GALACTIC_GHOST_2#0", "contents": "The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the ship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged it had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care and attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept. The substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious food and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed. When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be then that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes he thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control board, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in the direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great loneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever known would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair and hopeless pain. Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was sitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars. A chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered! Distinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted, it dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He watched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion. And then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth! Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished instantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few minutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes would help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass of fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a moving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth investigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the last flashing seconds of life. Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted its semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but, instead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused his heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it would reach the Mary Lou . Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing his ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars, though dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something about its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It resembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty years ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though half-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a rocket ship. But the instruments on the control board could not lie.

The presence of any material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed. But the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the presence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable. Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years in space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint ghost-like rocket ships? The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship! Was this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was impossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales told by men drunk with the liquors of Mars. \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself over and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now motionless a few hundred miles away. Deep within him a faint voice cried, \" It's come—for me! \" but Willard stilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it. There must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there had been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam forever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true for the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space? He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was not nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A moment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost Ship was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand as if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again. But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller, fainter and fainter. Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket recede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded loneliness of the stars descended upon him."}
{"chunk_id": "GALACTIC_GHOST_3#0", "contents": "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard would never see there was published a small item: \" Arden, Rocketport —Thirteen years ago the Space Ship Mary Lou under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the exploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been seen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II , in memory of his father.\" Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the cold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only things both dear and precious to him. Willard, master and lone survivor of the Mary Lou , knew this well for he had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the anguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be done. And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the Earth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known on Earth. In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and feeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his feet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew. How beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and friendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would never see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers and scientists. Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the shops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd that he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a man who is alone. Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he, for example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really only a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had seen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different situations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But perhaps space itself denies reason. Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here and a story there put together all that he knew: Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost Ship haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its tragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again. When your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a lifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you! And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy ship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage. Bitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind. Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost track of the days. It was difficult"}

When your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a lifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you! And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy ship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage. Bitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind. Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost track of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose could time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there reason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became meaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About three years must have passed since his last record in the log book of the Mary Lou . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another great disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a full-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with joy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy was short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly disappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a distant star through the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon him. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him. Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague fear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting and watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it. How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no longer a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing. Perhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care."}
{"chunk_id": "GALACTIC_GHOST_4#0", "contents": "Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not because it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been ingrained in him through the years. He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism of the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in perfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no speed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All was in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when there was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth, long forgotten Earth. He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him. He arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being marked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of the stars, he suddenly froze. There was a ship, coming toward him! For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt assailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no phantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight shone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid and had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the Ghost Ship in his youth. For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin, had gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him. The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him. \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU.\" With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent the answering message. \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\" He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within him and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened to the happiest message he had ever heard: \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU ARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO COME?\" Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words. \"YES! COMING!\" The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the Mary Lou . In a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically glad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago. He realized suddenly that everything about the Mary Lou was hateful to him. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty years of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair. He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock. The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away and a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was tossed to him.

A rope was tossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving the Mary Lou behind him forever. Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor say anything. His heart was choked with emotion. \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\" He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in bed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him."}
{"chunk_id": "GALACTIC_GHOST_5#0", "contents": "He woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the passing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so much of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the point of gibbering insanity. He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he never remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to remove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to also realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the value of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental shock of moving about among his people back on Earth. During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing it with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his friends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans' sleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges. And each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and confused. Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no longer was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But there was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they refused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual running of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions, they mumbled and drifted away. And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one night while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth swimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the years he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the Mary Lou . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had once known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years of solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind."}
{"chunk_id": "GALACTIC_GHOST_6#0", "contents": "He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought that perhaps he might still be in the Mary Lou . The warm, smiling face of a man quickly reassured him. \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know when you came to.\" Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He pressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He yawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his entire body. He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his mind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year and perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian expedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home base Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at the end of the trail. Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those years, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else. The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood up and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of his ship, but he would manage. \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\" \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled, \"Of course, you looked through the log book of the Mary Lou .\" The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very old man. \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly, measuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\" \"Yes?\" the old captain said. \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the thought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me and help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have died. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of vast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be now!\" A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the captain's eyes. \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\" Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips. \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked. The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged at him. \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a statement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly. Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him, he knew . \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is non-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All things that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass and energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened to the Mary Lou"}

Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years ago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel the change ourselves, for change is relative.

But to some ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen years—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist. \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on it...\" \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the simple reason that we would go through it!\" The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth again. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he walked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of birds. Never. Never. Never.... \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\" \"Yes.\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This was the endless problem of all spaceship cooks: He had to feed the men tomorrow on what they had eaten today! Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls, men on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's true that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion can never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a challenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts that a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list. In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing seals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers, celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the road to the larger Space without. Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the hundred-and-first chapter of Moby Dick , a book spooled in the amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more than a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of Leyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a man condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space. The Pequod's crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won their war on canned pork and beans. The Triton made her underwater periplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and concentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the skies, a decline set in. The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent food. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings from aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the groundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_2#0", "contents": "Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky through a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting exordium of Isaiah 36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today what was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water. The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning offal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a spacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount. Slimeheads remember the H. M. S. Ajax fiasco, for example, in which a galleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's shielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from the Ajax in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think of the Benjo Maru incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing Saccharomycodes yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent bite he ate to a superior grade of sake . And for a third footnote to the ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\" Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the Charles Partlow Sale . The Sale blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted in the maria to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann, the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was Robert Bailey. Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming, dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food. This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a statement of the least fuel a man can run on. Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the C. P. Sale no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat, protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the algae fed us. All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble from our 2,680 shaves"}

Even the stubble from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in essential amino acids. The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a breed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of squeamishness."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_3#0", "contents": "Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife in space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher extraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer, guardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder. Generally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim is the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain. If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties of his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann was the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do so alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have done splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart was a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet Earth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a Pullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social hemorrhoid. The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook. It was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey, Robert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate shipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed haut cuisine and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our algaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any other name than The Kitchen Cabinet. Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink, textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat. For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not. \"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea, \"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun in my home country: Mensch ist was er isst. It means, you are what you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this Schweinerei you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the ladder from the dining-cubby."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_4#0", "contents": "\"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me. \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got to live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\" \"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\" \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I said. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in my time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\" Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This is what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into its bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies, we'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\" \"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous death of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up the good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\" Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye from Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook waved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about tomorrow's menu.\" The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the next day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed with something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of burnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only guess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and drying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The pièce de résistance was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's so tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really steak.\" Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently imploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big man's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed. \"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and cycler-salt.\""}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_5#0", "contents": "\"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,\" I said. I gazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding. \"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another bite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and grasshoppers, to stay alive.\" \"Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded. \"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised algae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This—the brain that guides the ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me, Belly-Robber?\" Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really don't know what I can do to please you.\" \"You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban Hausfrau with the vapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums or weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will keep my belly content and my brain alive.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British term Dumb Insolence. Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I followed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you're driving Bailey too hard. You're asking him to make bricks without straw.\" Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor, that my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged man?\" \"Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,\" I said. \"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\" Winkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the Pharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the mother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him uncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment, to improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\" \"You're driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He'll crack.\" \"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we ground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys many discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\" \"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began. \"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_6#0", "contents": "Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical path to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my compliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of the crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius acidly called in question again. I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an ersatz hot turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy a grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a genuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said. \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second helping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but only arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere edibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics student. That will be all, Bailey.\" The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed, seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside, and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our Captain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice that would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when Winkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_7#0", "contents": "Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects besides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As his rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this ration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of books, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help him while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a fact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of spices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice, and a dozen others. Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards interested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien to his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd exercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance to the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram. To collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come aboard their ship mother-naked. But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects baggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon mess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet on the mysterious box as he sat to eat. \"What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today, Belly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook. Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd had much practice. \"I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\" he said. \"I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the texture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\" \"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out. Voila! I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine meat.\" \"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said. \"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with our food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of distaste. \"It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I never cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils the meal.\" Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of the table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates. \"Try it,\" he urged the Captain."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_8#0", "contents": "Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not too bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a more reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\" Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella. \"Aha! I have it!\" \"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked. \"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and ripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed the cap. \"Ketchup,\" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's masterpiece. \"The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.\" Lifting a hunk of the \"steak,\" streaming ketchup, to his mouth, Winkelmann chewed. \"Just the thing,\" he smiled. \"Damn you!\" Bailey shouted. Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook. \"... Sir,\" Bailey added. \"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said meditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\" \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began. \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you understand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded. \"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed, slave-driving....\" \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\" \"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion. \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said. \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\" \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said. \"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added."}
{"chunk_id": "GOURMET_9#0", "contents": "Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal bulkhead. \"You'll have that drink now,\" I said. \"No, dammit!\" he shouted. \"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is therapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it. After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said. \"You've taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to be ashamed of.\" \"He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel and sauerkraut and Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art out of an algae tank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet of the Friends of Escoffier!\" \"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You've worked your fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not appreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year from now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\" \"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be an apt confederate of vis medicatrix naturae , the healing power of nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed. For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in horribleness, a pottage or boiled Chlorella vulgaris that looked and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey, red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you're improving a little at last.\" Bailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said. I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were now strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain had pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I thought. Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted of salt, and went largely undrunk.

That evening, going down the ladder to supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier, of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss of canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the first-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\" \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said. \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman said. I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of us with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the galley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\" I said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is actually good .\" \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said. I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph; you couldn't have done it without him.\" \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\" Bailey asked. \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum performance out of his Ship's Cook.\" Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked. I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job. He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good of the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked, spearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll have to admit that I do.\" Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my plate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said."}

Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them five buckos for a glass of water—and got it! [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories May 1943. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Characteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity, though his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, with no dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land that had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically into the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his tall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something incoherent. They met in the doorway, violently. \"We're delirious!\" Joe cried. \"It's a mirage!\" \"What is?\" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton. Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared, speechless for once. In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea purveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had they seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon. Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two hands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the remaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish Harvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this impossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit juice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously. \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer things to know there are always more.\" He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped: \"Water—quick!\" Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out two glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked for more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender had taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey. Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so fast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender's impersonal eyes studying them shrewdly. \"Strangers, eh?\" he asked at last. \"Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,\" Harvey answered in his usual lush manner. \"We purvey that renowned Martian remedy, La-anago Yergis , the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in the ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in proclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history of therapeutics.\" \"Yeah?\" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser glasses without washing them. \"Where you heading?\" \"Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone without water for five ghastly days.\" \"Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?\" Joe asked. \"We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land here unless they're in trouble.\" \"Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.\" \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you"}

Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every chaser.\" Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That—that's robbery!\" the lanky man managed to get out in a thin quaver. The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta make more on each one. Besides—\" \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty crook—robbing poor spacemen! You—\" \"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\" Harvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the bartender apologetically. \"Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands are sometimes overactive. You were going to say—?\""}
{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_2#0", "contents": "The round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression. \"Folks are always thinkin' the other feller's out to do 'em,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Lemme explain about the water here. It's bitter as some kinds of sin before it's purified. Have to bring it in with buckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I was chargin' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge because I gotta.\" \"Friend,\" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight five-bucko bills, \"here is your money. What's fair is fair, and you have put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an unconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man's thirst.\" The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar. \"If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling your tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official recorder, fire chief....\" \"And chief of police, no doubt,\" said Harvey jocosely. \"Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just call me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will you need?\" Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half rations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively. \"Let's say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the quantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me more to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to, that's all.\" The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with them. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently watched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the proper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and wetted his lips expectantly. Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to do about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be preposterous. We simply can't afford it.\" Johnson's response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about charging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing. It's just the purified stuff that comes so high.\" After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water pool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed back to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside. \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe picked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly, is the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\" \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn't something you can get used to in ten minutes.\" In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from the igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents, according to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their buckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more."}

{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_3#0", "contents": "It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on a bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign in front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping a faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to investigate. Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound that was unmistakably a buried pipe. \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had to transport water in pails.\" \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily. \"It leads to the saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the pipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it leads from .\" Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of scrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst into the open—before a clear, sparkling pool. Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water. \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice. But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and tasting it. \"Sweet!\" he snarled. They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample. His mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The only thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's conscience.\" \"The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,\" said Harvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. \"Joseph, the good-natured artist in me has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we have had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this point hence.\" Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they stopped and their fists unclenched. \"Thought you gents were leaving,\" the mayor called out, seeing them frozen in the doorway. \"Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed. Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\" \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed. Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair and held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been born and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have kept him down near the general dimensions of a man. He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own hand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when his fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed one. \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense atmosphere. The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and unpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for.... \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you feel well?\" Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were gently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features drooping like a bloodhound's. \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming"}

He sagged against the door frame, all his features drooping like a bloodhound's. \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming down with asteroid fever!\" \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms of the disease that once scourged the universe.\" \"What do you mean, once ?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it every year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him out of here!\" \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\" \"Then he'll be here for months!\" Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and his gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe in tiny, uncontaminating gasps. \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said frantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction cups—\" \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man requires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\" \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction. Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand rocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a few minutes, carrying a bottle."}
{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_4#0", "contents": "Joe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly crossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly, put the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink. When Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner drink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and waited for the inevitable result. Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several moments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed to perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features straightened out. \"Are—are you all right?\" asked the mayor anxiously. \"Much better,\" said Joe in a weak voice. \"Maybe you need another dose,\" Harvey suggested. Joe recoiled. \"I'm fine now!\" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove it. Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face, and then the mayor timidly felt his pulse. \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" Johnson ejaculated. \" La-anago Yergis never fails, my friend,\" Harvey explained. \"By actual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three minutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught this one before it grew formidable.\" The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. \"If you don't charge too much,\" he said warily, \"I might think of buying some.\" \"We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,\" Harvey replied with dignity. \"It sells itself.\" \"'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole case,\" said Johnson. \"That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with the vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.\" \"How much?\" asked the mayor unhappily. \"For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred buckos.\" Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of doing so. \"F-four hundred,\" he offered. \"Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,\" Harvey said flatly. \"Make it four fifty,\" quavered Johnson. \"I dislike haggling,\" said Harvey. The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and fifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: \"And we will include, gratis , an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian handicraftsmanship.\" Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. \"No tricks now. I want a taste of that stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.\" Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The mayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing minute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which the man gradually won. \"There ain't no words for that taste,\" he gulped when it was safe to talk again. \"Medicine,\" Harvey propounded, \"should taste like medicine.\" To Joe he said: \"Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to which we have dedicated ourselves.\" With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the clearing and entered the ship.

As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped his murderous silence and cried: \"What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that snake oil?\" \"That was not poison,\" Harvey contradicted quietly. \"It was La-anago Yergis extract, plus.\" \"Plus what—arsenic?\" \"Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture our specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling yonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case, mind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been swindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have been, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.\" \"But why use it on me?\" Joe demanded furiously. Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. \"Did Johnson ask to taste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce the same medicine that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a guinea pig for a splendid cause.\" \"Okay, okay,\" Joe said. \"But you shoulda charged him more.\" \"Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which that swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he possesses. We could not be content with less.\" \"Well, we're starting all right,\" admitted Joe. \"How about that thing with six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?\" Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively. \"I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity. Apparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him. At first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our streamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic suckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the audio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous figure to the zoo!\""}
{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_5#0", "contents": "Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried the case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a place of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it down carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave him, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at least as good as the first; he gagged. \"That's the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted out the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously balanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain at paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter, and asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.\" Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about food at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry. \"It's only water we were short of,\" Harvey said apprehensively. \"We've got rations back at the ship.\" \" H-mph! \" the mayor grunted. \"Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap. Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome to our hospitality.\" \"Your hospitality,\" said Harvey, \"depends on the prices you charge.\" \"Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying,\" answered the mayor promptly. \"What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here you can't get anywhere else for any price.\" Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw none. \"Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,\" he said guardedly. Johnson immediately fell into the role of \"mine host.\" \"Come right in, gents,\" he invited. \"Right into the dining room.\" He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or less private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little chance of company. Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with two menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins, silverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails, which were on the house. Then he stood by for orders. Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were phenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he grinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\" \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\" For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the culinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service was as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played deftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian viotars , using his other two hands for waiting on the table. \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey whispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the kitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society hostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum to women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\" \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You're right.\" \"But I dislike having to revise"}

This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate our check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\" The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion. \"It's been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain't often I have visitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\" As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and Harvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in a yelp of horror. \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.—\"How do you arrive at this fantastic, idiotic figure— three hundred and twenty-eight buckos !\""}
{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_6#0", "contents": "Johnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table, not a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty fingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu. Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with rage. The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80 redsents.\" \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won't pay it!\" Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you'd act like that,\" he said with regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on his vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. \"Afraid I'll have to ask the sheriff to take over.\" Johnson, the \"sheriff,\" collected the money, and Johnson, the \"restaurateur,\" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to remain calm. \"My friend,\" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a schoolmasterish severity, \"your long absence from Earth has perhaps made you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the folk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: 'It is folly to kill a goose that lays golden eggs,' and 'Penny wise is pound foolish.'\" \"I don't get the connection,\" objected Johnson. \"Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put out of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial deal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for the peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the way you have—\" \"Who said I wanted to sell him?\" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his fingers together and asked disinterestedly: \"What were you going to offer, anyhow?\" \"It doesn't matter any longer,\" Harvey said with elaborate carelessness. \"Perhaps you wouldn't have accepted it, anyway.\" \"That's right,\" Johnson came back emphatically. \"But what would your offer have been which I would have turned down?\" \"Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?\" \"Either one. It don't make no difference. Genius is too valuable to sell.\" \"Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don't tell me no amount of money would tempt you!\" \"Nope. But how much did you say?\" \"Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!\" \"Well, I'll tell you something,\" said the mayor confidentially. \"When you've got one thing, you've got one thing. But when you've got money, it's the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you've got money, you can buy this and that and this and that and—\" \"This and that,\" concluded Joe. \"We'll give you five hundred buckos.\" \"Now, gents!\" Johnson remonstrated. \"Why, six hundred would hardly—\" \"You haven't left us much money,\" Harvey put in. The mayor frowned. \"All right, we'll split the difference. Make it five-fifty.\" Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he stood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively acquired. \"I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,\" he said to Johnson. \"I should imagine you will"}

To Johnson he explained: \"You must see the wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner will soon have it here for your astonishment.\" Joe's face grew as glum as Johnson's had been. \"Aw, Harv,\" he protested, \"do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were getting the key!\" \"We must not be selfish, my boy,\" Harvey said nobly. \"We have had our chance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might have more success than we.

He was bursting with questions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For his part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba until Joe came in, lugging a radio. \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes you think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and political speech-makers.\" \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word, and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had, with the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor of this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\" \"I ain't in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly. Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph. He has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our study, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an enormous fortune.\" \"Well, that's no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I'm glad he did turn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole years.\" He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door. \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain't saying I'll buy, but what is it I'm turning down?\" Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face sorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet. \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among the chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before his tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He banged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again, that was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit his greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!\" \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out. \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered that the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by energy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the inhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than ourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would find himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\" The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar. \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\" \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor Dean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\" The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared thoughtfully at the battered cabinet. \"Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he conceded. \"But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up there wouldn't talk our language.\" Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy lie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?\" Johnson recoiled. \"No—no, of course not . I mean, being up here, I naturally couldn't get all the details.\""}

I mean, being up here, I naturally couldn't get all the details.\" \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I'm sorry I lost my temper. But it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts emanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be so difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was communication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired our language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own hyper-scientific trimmings?\" \"Why, I don't know,\" Johnson said in confusion. \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect the simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed broadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor failed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could stand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to solve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\" Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\" \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be rewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who could devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a person with unusual patience.\" \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\" \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\" Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\""}
{"chunk_id": "GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_8#0", "contents": "Harvey turned a knob on the face of the scarred radio. After several squeals of spatial figures, a smooth voice began: \"There are omnious pleajes of moby-hailegs in sonmirand which, howgraismon, are notch to be donfured miss ellasellabell in either or both hagasanipaj, by all means. This does not refly, on the brother man, nat or mizzafil saces are denuded by this ossifaligo....\" Harvey switched off the set determinedly. \"Wait a minute!\" Johnson begged. \"I almost got it then!\" \"I dislike being commercial,\" said Harvey, \"but this astounding device still belongs to us. Would we not be foolish to let you discover the clue before purchasing the right to do so?\" The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized longing. \"How much do you want?\" he asked unhappily. \"One thousand buckos, and no haggling. I am not in the mood.\" Johnson opened his mouth to argue; then, seeing Harvey's set features, paid with the worst possible grace. \"Don't you think we ought to tell him about the batteries, Harv?\" Joe asked. \"What about the batteries?\" demanded Johnson with deadly calm. \"A very small matter,\" Harvey said airily. \"You see, we have been analyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course, the batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not less than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.\" \"What do I do then?\" Harvey shrugged. \"Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph has by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their kind left in the system, I ask only what they cost—one hundred and ninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.\" Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his gun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted. Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors collected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were outside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely to a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying: \"Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort. If you rue amount it, how do you respench a pure woman to ansver go-samak—\" \"I'll get it!\" they heard Johnson mutter. Then the sound of giant feet crossing the barroom floor reached their ears, and a shrill question: \"What's that, Papa?\" \"A fortune, Jed! Those fakers are damned fools, selling us a thing like—\" Joe gazed at Harvey admiringly. \"Another one sold? Harv, that spiel pulls them in like an ether storm!\" Together with the remarkable planetoid man, they reached the ship. Above them, dark, tumbling shapes blotted out the stars and silently moved on. Joe opened the gangway door. \"Come on in, pal,\" he said to Genius. \"We're shoving off.\" The planetoid man grinned foolishly. \"Can't go arong with you,\" he said with an apologetic manner. \"I rike to, but pressure fratten me out if I go.\" \"What in solar blazes are you talking about?\" Harvey asked. \"I grow up on pranetoid,\" Genius explained. \"On big pranet, too much pressure for me.\" The two salesmen"}

I never reave pranetoid, though.\" \"Joseph,\" Harvey said ominously, \"that slick colonist has put one over upon us. What is our customary procedure in that event?\" \"We tear him apart,\" Joe replied between his teeth. \"Not Mister Johnson,\" advised Genius. \"Have gun and badge. He shoot you first and then rock you up in prison.\" Harvey paused, his ominous air vanishing. \"True.

Within a few minutes the automatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the asteroid belt. \"I got kind of dizzy,\" Joe said, \"there were so many deals back and forth. How much did we make on the sucker?\" \"A goodly amount, I wager,\" Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and paper. \"Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199. Total—let's see—1668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.\" He emptied his pockets of money, spread it out on the astrogation table and began counting. Finished, he looked up, troubled. \"How much did we have when we landed, Joseph?\" \"Exactly 1668 buckos,\" Joe answered promptly. \"I can't understand it,\" said Harvey. \"Instead of double our capital, we now have only 1668 buckos and 50 redsents!\" Feverishly, he returned to his pencil and paper. \"Drinking water, 790; battery water, free; meal, 328; planetoid man, 550. Total: 1668 buckos!\" He stared at the figures. \"We paid out almost as much as we took in,\" he said bitterly. \"Despite our intensive efforts, we made the absurd sum of fifty redsents.\" \"Why, the dirty crook!\" Joe growled. But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical. \"Perhaps, Joseph, we are more fortunate than we realize. We were, after all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more I believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty redsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\" Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly and asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\" \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\" \"How much did it cost us?\" Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're right, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after all that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\" \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\" He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on Mars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\" \" Goldbricks! \" Harvey said succinctly. Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars."}

DE VET Illustrated by TURPIN [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction July 1957. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Kaiser stared at the tape in his hand for a long uncomprehending minute. How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby talk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this last communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual about it? He went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as they should. OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER, LET USNS KNOW. SS II Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape thoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large drops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout ship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground. \"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do anything here except rain?\" His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And why was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been doing during that time? Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture from his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out when the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he was stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the job very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle alone—or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or no chance of his being able to find either here. Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and brought them out where he could look at them: The mother ship, Soscites II , had been on the last leg of its planet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout ship—the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the exploring of new worlds—and set itself into a giant orbit about this planet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy. The Soscites II had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means of slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop. Its limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an orbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle a pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low. Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here forever. That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing recently.

It held about a yard and a half of tape, probably his last several messages—both those sent and those received. He pulled it out impatiently and began reading. The first was from himself: YOUR SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUT WITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT? AND WHERE DO I GET IT? DO YOU THINK I FOUND A TOOL SHOP DOWN HERE? FOR GOD'S SAKE, COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER. VISITED SEAL-PEOPLE AGAIN TODAY. STILL HAVE THEIR STINK IN MY NOSE. FOUND HUTS ALONG RIVER BANK, SO I GUESS THEY DON'T LIVE IN WATER. BUT THEY DO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME THERE. NO, I HAVE NO WAY OF ESTIMATING THEIR INTELLIGENCE. I WOULD JUDGE IT AVERAGES NO HIGHER THAN SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HUMAN. THEY DEFINITELY DO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. WILL TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM, BUT YOU GET TO WORK FAST ON HOW I REPAIR SCOUT. SWELLING IN ARM WORSE AND AM DEVELOPING A FEVER. TEMPERATURE 102.7 AN HOUR AGO. SMOKY The ship must have answered immediately, for the return message time was six hours later than his own, the minimum interval necessary for two-way exchange. DOING OUR BEST, SMOKY. YOUR IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, AS WE SEE IT, IS TO KEEP WELL. WE FED ALL THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE US INTO SAM, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXCEPT THE STING IN YOUR ARM. AS EXPECTED, ALL THAT CAME OUT WAS \"DATA INSUFFICIENT.\" TRY TO GIVE US MORE. ALSO DETAIL ALL SYMPTOMS SINCE YOUR LAST REPORT. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AT THIS END. GOOD LUCK. SS II Sam, Kaiser knew, was the ship's mechanical diagnostician. His report followed: ARM SWOLLEN. UNABLE TO KEEP DOWN FOOD LAST TWELVE HOURS. ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO, ENTIRE BODY TURNED LIVID RED. BRIEF PERIODS OF BLANKNESS. THINGS KEEP COMING AND GOING. SICK AS HELL. HURRY. SMOKY The ship's next message read: INFECTION QUITE DEFINITE. BUT SOMETHING STRANGE THERE. GIVE US ANYTHING MORE YOU HAVE. SS II His own reply perplexed Kaiser: LAST LETTER FUNNY. I NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY IS OO SENDING GARBLE TALK? DID USNS MAKE UP SECRET MESSAGES? SMOKY The expedition, apparently, was as puzzled as he: WHAT'S THE MATTER, SMOKY? THAT LAST MESSAGE WAS IN PLAIN TERRAN. NO REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T READ IT. AND WHY THE BABY TALK? IF YOU'RE SPOOFING, STOP. GIVE US MORE SYMPTOMS. HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW? SS II The baby talk was worse on Kaiser's next: TWAZY. WHAT FOR OO TENDING TWAZY LETTERS? FINK UM CAN WEAD TWAZY LETTERS? SKIN ALL YELLOW NOW. COLD. COLD. CO The ship's following communication was three hours late. It was the last on the tape—the one Kaiser had read earlier. Apparently they decided to humor him.

He felt better now, outside of a muscular weariness, as though convalescing from a long illness. He put the back of his hand to his forehead. Cool. No fever anyway. He glanced at the clock-calendar on the instrument board and back at the date and time on the tape where he'd started his baby talk. Twenty hours. He hadn't been out of his head too long. He began punching the communicator keys while he nibbled at a biscuit. SEEM TO BE FULLY RECOVERED. FEELING FINE. ANYTHING NEW FROM SAM? AND HOW ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO SCOUT? GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU HAVE ON EITHER OR BOTH. SMOKY Kaiser felt suddenly weary. He lay on the scout's bunk and tried to sleep. Soon he was in that phantasm land between sleep and wakefulness—he knew he was not sleeping, yet he did dream. It was the same dream he had had many times before. In it, he was back home again, the home he had joined the space service to escape. He had realized soon after his marriage that his wife, Helene, did not love him. She had married him for the security his pay check provided. And though it soon became evident that she, too, regretted her bargain, she would not divorce him. Instead, she had her revenge on him by persistent nagging, by letting herself grow fat and querulous, and by caring for their house only in a slovenly way. Her crippled brother had moved in with them the day they were married. His mind was as crippled as his body and he took an unhealthy delight in helping his sister torment Kaiser."}
{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_3#0", "contents": "Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an hour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still five more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck and shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout. After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of Big Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a heavy drizzle now. Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest against one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots and a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with a slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll over onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground. The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm. Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid ground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside the ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae, extending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded temperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary conditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and all its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study. Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide, sluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there, he headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a higher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw them. As usual, most were swimming in the river. One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture of gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps a lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his toothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that might have been a greeting—or a warning to the others that a stranger approached. The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery body of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms to his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in three-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick, with footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave his legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish smell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm. The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling slightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm forward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main group."}

{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_4#0", "contents": "They had stopped their play and eating as Kaiser approached and now most of them swam in to shore and stood in the water, staring and piping. They varied in size from small seal-pups to full-grown adults. Some chewed on bunches of water weed, which they manipulated with their lips and drew into their mouths. They had mammalian characteristics, Kaiser had noted before, so it was not difficult to distinguish the females from the males. The proportion was roughly fifty-fifty. Several of the bolder males climbed up beside Kaiser and began pawing his plastic clothing. Kaiser stood still and tried to keep his breathing shallow, for their odor was almost more than he could bear. One native smeared Kaiser's face with an exploring paw and Kaiser gagged and pushed him roughly away. He was bound by regulations to display no hostility to newly discovered natives, but he couldn't take much more of this. A young female splashed water on two young males who stood near and they turned with shrill pipings and chased her into the water. The entire group seemed to lose interest in Kaiser and joined in the chase, or went back to other diversions of their own. Kaiser's inspectors followed. They were a mindless lot, Kaiser observed. The river supplied them with an easy existence, with food and living space, and apparently they had few natural enemies. Kaiser walked away, following the long slow bend of the river, and came to a collection of perhaps two hundred dwellings built in three haphazard rows along the river bank. He took time to study their construction more closely this time. They were all round domes, little more than the height of a man, built of blocks that appeared to be mud, packed with river weed and sand. How they were able to dry these to give them the necessary solidity, Kaiser did not know. He had found no signs that they knew how to use fire, and all apparent evidence was against their having it. They then had to have sunlight. Maybe it rained less during certain seasons. The domes' construction was based on a series of four arches built in a circle. When the base covering the periphery had been laid, four others were built on and between them, and continued in successive tiers until the top was reached. Each tier thus furnished support for the next above. No other framework was needed. The final tier formed the roof. They made sound shelters, but Kaiser had peered into several and found them dark and dank—and as smelly as the natives themselves. The few loungers in the village paid little attention to Kaiser and he wandered through the irregular streets until he became bored and returned to the scout. The Soscites II sent little that helped during the next twelve hours and Kaiser occupied his time trying again to repair the damage to the scout. The job appeared maddeningly simply. As the scout had glided in for a soft landing, its metal bottom had ridden a concealed rock and bent inward."}

He still could think of no way to do the job, simple as it was, though he gave his concentration to it the rest of the day. That evening, Kaiser received information from the Soscites II that was at least definite: SET YOURSELF FOR A SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FINALLY CAME THROUGH. YOU WON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR. AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU HAVE BEEN INVADED BY A SYMBIOTE—SIMILAR TO THE TYPE FOUND ON THE SAND WORLD, BARTEL-BLEETHERS. GIVE US A FEW MORE HOURS TO WORK WITH SAM AND WE'LL GET YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS HE CAN GIVE US. HANG ON NOW! SOSCITES II Kaiser's reply was short and succinct: WHAT THE HELL? SMOKY Soscites II's next communication followed within twenty minutes and was signed by the ship's doctor: JUST A FEW WORDS, SMOKY, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I THOUGHT I'D GET THIS OFF WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM SAM. REMEMBER THAT A SYMBIOTE IS NOT A PARASITE. IT WILL NOT HARM YOU, EXCEPT INADVERTENTLY. YOUR WELFARE IS AS ESSENTIAL TO IT AS TO YOU. ALMOST CERTAINLY, IF YOU DIE, IT WILL DIE WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE YOU'VE HAD SO FAR WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SYMBIOTE'S DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING ITSELF TO ITS NEW ENVIRONMENT. IN A WAY, I ENVY YOU. MORE LATER, WHEN WE FINISH WITH SAM. J. G. ZARWELL Kaiser did not answer. The news was so startling, so unforeseen, that his mind refused to accept the actuality. He lay on the scout's bunk and stared at the ceiling without conscious attention, and with very little clear thought, for several hours—until the next communication came in: WELL, THIS IS WHAT SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY. SYMBIOTE AMICABLE AND APPARENTLY SWIFTLY ADAPTABLE. YOUR CHANGING COLOR, DIFFICULTY IN EATING AND EVEN BABY TALK WERE THE RESULT OF ITS EFFORTS TO GIVE YOU WHAT IT BELIEVED YOU NEEDED OR WANTED. CHANGING COLOR: PROTECTIVE CAMOUFLAGE. TROUBLE KEEPING FOOD DOWN: IT KEPT YOUR STOMACH EMPTY BECAUSE IT SENSED YOU WERE IN TROUBLE AND MIGHT HAVE NEED FOR SHARP REFLEXES, WITH NO EXCESS WEIGHT TO CARRY. THE BABY TALK WE AREN'T TOO CERTAIN ABOUT, BUT OUR BEST CONCLUSION IS THAT WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, YOU WERE MOST HAPPY. IT WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU BACK THAT HAPPY STATE OF MIND. OBVIOUSLY IT QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE MISTAKES IT MADE AND CORRECTED THEM. SAM CAME UP WITH A FEW MORE IDEAS, BUT WE WANT TO WORK ON THEM A BIT BEFORE WE SEND THEM THROUGH. SLEEP ON THIS. SS II"}

He was not the gregarious type and had no close friends on board. He had hoped to find the solitude he liked best in space, but he had been disappointed. True, there were fewer people here, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he would have been more contented living in a crowded city. His naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because he was more intelligent and efficient than they were. He did his work well and painstakingly and was seldom in error. They would have liked him better had he been more prone to mistakes. He was certain that they respected him, but they did not like him. And he returned the dislike. The suggestion that he get some sleep might not be a bad idea. He hadn't slept in over eighteen hours, Kaiser realized—and fell instantly asleep. The communicator had a message waiting for him when he awoke: SAM COULDN'T HELP US MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT AFTER RESEARCH AND MUCH DISCUSSION, WE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING TWO CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS EITHER THAT OF A VERY THIN LIQUID OR, MORE PROBABLY, A VIRUS FORM WITH SWIFT PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTIC. IT UNDOUBTEDLY LIVES IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND PERMEATES YOUR SYSTEM. SECOND, IT SEEMED TO US, AS IT MUST HAVE TO YOU, THAT THE SYMBIOTE COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED BY READING YOUR MIND. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY NOW. WE THINK THAT IT HAS SUCH CLOSE CONTACT WITH YOUR GLANDS AND THEIR SECRETIONS, WHICH STIMULATE EMOTION, THAT IT CAN GAUGE YOUR FEELINGS EVEN MORE ACCURATELY THAN YOU YOURSELF CAN. THUS IT CAN JUDGE YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES QUITE ACCURATELY. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU TEST OUR THEORY. THERE ARE DOZENS OF WAYS. IF YOU ARE STUMPED AND NEED SUGGESTIONS, JUST LET US KNOW. WE AWAIT WORD FROM YOU WITH GREAT INTEREST. SS II By now, Kaiser had accepted what had happened to him. His distress and anxiety were gone and he was impatient to do what he could to establish better contact with his uninvited tenant. With eager anticipation, he set to thinking how it could be done. After a few minutes, an idea occurred to him. Taking a small scalpel from a medical kit, he made a shallow cut in his arm, just deep enough to bleed freely. He knew that the pain would supply the necessary glandular reaction. The cut bled a few slow drops—and as Kaiser watched, a shiny film formed and the bleeding stopped. That checked pretty well with the ship's theory. Perhaps the symbiote had made his senses more acute. He tried closing his eyes and fingering several objects in the room. It seemed to him that he could determine the texture of each better than before, but the test was inconclusive. Walking to the rear of the scout, he tried reading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood out sharp and clear!"}

The temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture on his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been here.

At first, despite the lack of success in straightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a subdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the symbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really important problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming discouraged. At last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He sent out a terse message to the Soscites II : TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE INTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS ANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL, BUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE? I CAN'T FIX SCOUT WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS, AND IF MY GUESS IS RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT TO RETURN IN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT. SMOKY Kaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires, a spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed that a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at the native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he wondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant horseshoe. He intended to find out. Wrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the doorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on his shoulders and began his journey—in the opposite direction from the first native settlement. He walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise had been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the river, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This group was decidedly more advanced than the first! They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change was mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was more subdued, less repugnant. By signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to understand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and called to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The first male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a gesture of friendship. The weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned part of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it. The weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed the mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him and waited with some trepidation for a reaction."}

{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_8#0", "contents": "As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the native settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react to the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by his digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at peace with this world. Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise of some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in case. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the beast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as it went. The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of shorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in the water when he arrived and were very friendly. That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded around as he swam—they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency—and often nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had difficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he neared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and pulled him under. Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was clowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him helpless. They sank deeper. When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of bubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee up into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the surface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his feet hit the river bottom. As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and seemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying to think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but there was none. He shrugged helplessly. There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here—if they had the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for them—and he packed and started back to the scout. Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed the relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and now he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist, he wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his bare skin were pleasant to feel. When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The tarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free it. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling the equipment to the ground. Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in the tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly his eyes widened."}

He did not consult the communicator, as he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped place on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there. Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine casing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried again, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The metal beneath yielded slightly—but he felt the palms of his hands bruise against the lever. Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted. His hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased tremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried again. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly—until the fuel pump hung free! Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution rest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its anticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act. He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to read the two messages waiting for him. The first was quite routine: REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL WEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME MOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST BE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID. TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME ADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE SYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH SYMBIOTES' AID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE. WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED. GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES. SS II The second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note of uneasiness in it. SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT. INFORMATION ON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES. SS II Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had covered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to sleep. In the morning, another message was waiting: VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY. SS II"}
{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_10#0", "contents": "Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the Soscites II be experiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they were, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a suggestion of urgency—there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of information. Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser. He knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time. And the Soscites II would not complete its orbit of the planet for two weeks yet. Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used to wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the vicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went back inside. Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the captain himself: WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR SCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER! H. A. HESSE, CAPT. Kaiser pushed the last of his meal—which he had been eating with his fingers—into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his hands with it and dropped it to the floor. He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding the captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for serious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only to the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment. It was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from the ship on his trip."}
{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_11#0", "contents": "The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and when Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to the village he had visited the day before. However, there were other seal-people here. And they were almost human! The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup—that was little changed from the first he had found—as in their obviously greater intelligence. This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked. Kaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he slipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them. Where the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly alike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these had no odor—only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet him, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings. Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes of curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent. One was a female. They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he understood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He tried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object, but their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused himself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was fairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to carry on a limited conversation. The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until Kaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached the river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water."}
{"chunk_id": "GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_12#0", "contents": "Before he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the communicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment, then returned and read the message on the tape: STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM YOU. IN MEANTIME, GIVE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOLLOWING. WE KNOW THAT THE SYMBIOTES MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SEAL-PEOPLE. THERE IS EVERY PROBABILITY THAT YOURS WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU—TO BETTER FIT YOUR BODY TO ITS PRESENT ENVIRONMENT. THE DANGER, WHICH WE HESITATED TO MENTION UNTIL NOW—WHEN YOU HAVE FORCED US BY YOUR OBSTINATE SILENCE—IS THAT IT CAN ALTER YOUR MIND ALSO. YOUR REPORT ON SECOND TRIBE OF SEAL-PEOPLE STRONGLY INDICATES THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING. THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT MORE INTELLIGENT AND HUMANLIKE THAN THE OTHERS. ON THE CONTRARY, YOU ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THEM. DANGER ACUTE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY. REPEAT: IMMEDIATELY! SS II Kaiser picked up a large rock and slowly, methodically pounded the communicator into a flattened jumble of metal and loose parts. When he finished, he returned to the waiting girl on the river bank. She pointed at his plastic trousers and made laughing sounds in her throat. Kaiser returned the laugh and stripped off the trousers. They ran, still laughing, into the water. Already the long pink hair that had been growing on his body during the past week was beginning to turn brown at the roots."}

HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for every place, but on robot-harried Mars the situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner from jumping. \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and let go of everything.\" Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs. For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously stationary sofa. \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr. Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a trial?\" Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes. \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\" Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently. \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible, reasonable coöperation from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the—\" \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread. \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk twenty years ago?\" Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt!

{"chunk_id": "HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_2#0", "contents": "Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere with the harmony of his home. \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man, you missed a bet!\" Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes, other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the drawing looked lovely and enticing. \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\" Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you, Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns to process the stuff!\" Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\" Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that was when he saw the line about the robots. \"—the only hotel staffed entirely with robot servants—\" \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll disfranchise him! I'll—\" \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel, why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\" \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual lope. \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say"}

{"chunk_id": "HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_3#0", "contents": "The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the interval. It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel. Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting, green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval. He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt, he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently. Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly he went over to the desk. He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself. Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the stress of the argument. \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you hear?\" No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing. The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive, really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know. Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he smiled at the enraged woman. \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good. I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want someone to hear what I say!

I want to be able to change my mind once in awhile!\" Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk. \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment, please.\" He turned back to the woman. But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil enough to wait your turn!\" Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course, are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned authoritatively to the clerk. \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing your—ah—discussion with the lady.\" The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow. \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist banged the counter. The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it. Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper. \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a silent and efficient robot."}
{"chunk_id": "HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_4#0", "contents": "The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men; mere details.... Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule. Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim cigar—his first in months—and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax. Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him out. Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded. \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\" He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest. Inexorably it pushed him flat. \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something, at that."}
{"chunk_id": "HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_5#0", "contents": "There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered. \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots around here, have you?\" Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his fist and contemplated the outrage. \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor. \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with the blasted things. And as for using force—it's man against metal. You try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready to staff my offices with the things!\" The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\" \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You mean you work out here on the tundra?\" \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts. Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it, he's about out of business.\" Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak. But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third robot enter, wheeling a chair. \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me! Take it away!\" The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly. The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the treatment"}

Again he lifted the receiver of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly, mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed."}

For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often, since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and exercised him. Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept. There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal. \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he could wake up enough to be. He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again, still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it. After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a man or he's stuck.\" \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait any longer to break out of this—this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what happens?\" \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll get my clothes.\" Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\" \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\" Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you? I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\" Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's okay with"}

It's okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in that fancy lobby.\" Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\" Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's clothing. The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone. \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for me. I want to go down to the lobby.\" He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to the elevator."}

He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots shared his self control. The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor. Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard. With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he ordered. \"Take him to the—to the mud-baths!\" \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes. Especially, card indexes. \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get it straight again! Stop it!\" \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave. With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became oddly inanimate. \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the collar of his flapping coat. \"Now—the manager, please.\" \"This—this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at the same time phrase his resignation in his mind. Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good man—\" he began. \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why? Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me, Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\" Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair."}

And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair. With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered. \"As if I invented the damned things!\" Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway, at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my resignation.\" Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way. We—\" he grimaced disgustedly—\"had to pioneer in the use of robots. And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help. So—Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\" Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said mildly. Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts, aren't you?\" Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands—at a reasonable price, of course—and forget the outrages I've suffered at your establishment.\" Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots after what you've seen and experienced?\" Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\" With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr. Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but across the lobby to the elevator.

They watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed. \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib, it's amazing! Look at him! And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years. \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it again!\" Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to you. All right?\" \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\" Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped. \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they belong!\" He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary, waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead.

Then he thought of the block of stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate, honey?\" \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left the port."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed. ILLUSTRATED BY KRENKEL HIS MASTER'S VOICE ANALOG SCIENCE FACT · SCIENCE FICTION Spaceship McGuire had lots of knowledge—but no wisdom. He was smart—but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to ask questions too profound for any philosopher—questions like \"Who are you?\" By RANDALL GARRETT I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called Raven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar Ravenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it came to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could make anyone dislike him without trying. When I entered the office, he was [3] sitting behind his mahogany desk, his eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass and a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said: \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\" I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point in my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\" He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a planetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter per second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have to be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low as ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting right out of the glass [4] again. The momentum it builds up is enough to make it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all over the place. Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to fall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it. Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice. He tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges touching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a head on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at work would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action on a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The negative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time you see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and throwing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force. I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at it. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and neater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way. He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and sipped appreciatively.

Not until he put it back down on the desk again did he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come in. \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\" \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping my voice level. [5] \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your action than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of heavy linseed oil. He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When I didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have inadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent sabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\" I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back the fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think you'd win.\" \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your own impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would hardly offer to pay you another one.\" I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial business and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains. Ravenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to personal relationships, he wasn't very wise. \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the point,\" I told him. \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through your own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that your sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\" \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation of the concepts might not be quite [6] the same as yours. Get to the point.\" He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell me that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by unauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after activation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth be considered its ... ah ... master. \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being' unambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that it would be much easier to define a single individual. That would prevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the single individual were careful in giving orders himself. \"Now, it appears that you , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to McGuire after he had been activated.

Is that correct?\" \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best expression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had explained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire and the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up what had really happened."}

[7] A man has to be a good actor to be a competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I knew a great deal more about the problem than he did. He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They realize now that there should be some way of making that change, but they failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely draining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can this bias be eliminated.\" \"Then why don't they do that?\" \"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of anger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes time, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and make the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of the improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other words, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is precisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\" \"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me because things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on the McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position as manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts might be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and Ravenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely. \"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you [8] money?\" \"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again—understandably enough, I think.\" \"Perfectly. It's mutual.\" He ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding work, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first six models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at me. \"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to be tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the fore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his hull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further attempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\" \"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go to Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\" \"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of that kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on the McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other spacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and very determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am certain that the robot ship is the answer to the transportation problems in"}

For the sake of every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of McGuire!\" What's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody , I quoted to myself. I'd have said it out loud, [9] but I was fairly certain that Shalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics. \"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the robotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to be the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can be turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\" \"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\" \"I don't deny it.\" \"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be charged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't want to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8 is successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\" \"How much?\" \"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to build a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs in it.\" He considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will do it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one each six months for three years after the first successful commercial ship is built by Viking.\" \"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a deal. Is there anything else?\" \"No.\" \"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\" \"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness [10] of his voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman is a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall welcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to subside.\" I could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding his own touch of color to the room. And, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal triumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost nothing, he'd really have blown up."}

The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted sky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on a bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the magnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the nickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I was stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself against the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker beacon on my way to Ceres. For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized spaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial engine and the few necessities of life—air, some water, and a very little food—still costs more than a Rolls-Royce [11] automobile does on Earth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in the Belt. They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay in a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to hop from beacon to beacon, which means that your average velocity doesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating and decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the neighborhood in, and that's all that's needed. I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one gee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming ordeal with McGuire. Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my business. The sign on the door of my office in New York says: DANIEL OAK, Confidential Expediter ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things Done. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a spaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the business, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but collecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted to. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important than Shalimar Ravenhurst. Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and Function can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of the System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to evaluate the political activities of [12] various sub-governments all over the System.

The vast majority of [13] the System's citizens don't even know the Government has a Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the Political Survey Division. The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of McGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the traffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable as McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables and making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given orders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving and safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot. And a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders that may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician. Those orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to repair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care of such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the malfunctioning of an individual automobile. McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in command of a spacecraft. In a sense, he was the spacecraft, since it served him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves the human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a top velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge of a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per second. Nor [14] did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths were variable and led through the emptiness of space. Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them having to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be somewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans aboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull. But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be necessary to give orders— fast ! And that means verbal orders, orders that can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by microphone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a teletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space. That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has to be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well. And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with."}

{"chunk_id": "HIS_MASTER'S_VOICE_ANALOG_SCIENCE_FACT_·_SCIENCE_FICTION_4#0", "contents": "For more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain. First Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow harm to come to a human being. Second Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except when such orders conflict with the First Law . [15] Third Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except when this conflicts with the First or Second Law. Nobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining the term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot can encompass the concept. A traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly narrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\" are the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries, illegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's only concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the only way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging the pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen. And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a traffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile. With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists attempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first six went insane. If one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\" the robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more valid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot brain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would be called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you, depending [16] on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous as an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if not more so. So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was impressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws. If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult to define a responsible human being. One, in other words, who can be relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be relied upon not to drive the robot insane. The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another tack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members of a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one responsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only from that person.\" As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\" for \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how important I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire."}

I don't like riding in flitterboats, sitting on a [17] bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a broomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me and the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you can't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until you hit the next beacon station. Ceres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon station. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And except for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres, lock, stock, and mining rights. Part of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership. There were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their hands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything short of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to that, too, before very long. Ceres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody would cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as dirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a great deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt. But, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface gravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981, and that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly hampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds on Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a strain that takes a [18] week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in the Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at least an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them from growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense takes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give you a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise. I parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by Landing Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome. After I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the inner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me. \"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his scarred, battered face. \"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said, shaking his extended hand. \"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me. \"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath and some sleep.\" \"You'll get that, but first"}

Seriously, what I need is a bath and some sleep.\" \"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want a drink?\" \"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\" \"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\" I followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By definition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions follow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point. [19] Colonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union suit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was a tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor seemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were shocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other colors. A crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of Midwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt. You can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you did, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle that chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might have to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels inside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are places where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away from his vac suit. I read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he claimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually due to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to the colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid over. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the suit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right; I wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I have spent summers in nudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves with lavender [20] and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who go to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who go to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different. I'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go on wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits."}

We sat down at a table and ordered drinks when the waiter bustled over. A cop in uniform isn't supposed to drink, but Brock figures that the head of the Security Guard ought to be able to get away with a breach of his own rules. We had our drinks in front of us and our cigarettes lit before Brock opened up with his troubles. \"Oak,\" he said, \"I wanted to intercept you before you went to the plant because I want you to know that there may be trouble.\" \"Yeah? What kind?\" Sometimes it's a pain to play ignorant. \"Thurston's outfit is trying to oust Ravenhurst from the managership of Viking and take over the job. Baedecker Metals & Mining Corporation, which is managed by Baedecker himself, wants to force Viking out of business so that BM&M can take over Ceres for large-scale processing of precious metals. \"Between the two of 'em, they're raising all sorts of minor hell around [21] here, and it's liable to become major hell at any time. And we can't stand any hell—or sabotage—around this planetoid just now!\" \"Now wait a minute,\" I said, still playing ignorant, \"I thought we'd pretty well established that the 'sabotage' of the McGuire series was Jack Ravenhurst's fault. She was the one who was driving them nuts, not Thurston's agents.\" \"Perfectly true,\" he said agreeably. \"We managed to block any attempts of sabotage by other company agents, even though it looked as though we hadn't for a while.\" He chuckled wryly. \"We went all out to keep the McGuires safe, and all the time the boss' daughter was giving them the works.\" Then he looked sharply at me. \"I covered that, of course. No one in the Security Guard but me knows that Jack was responsible.\" \"Good. But what about the Thurston and Baedecker agents, then?\" He took a hefty slug of his drink. \"They're around, all right. We have our eyes on the ones we know, but those outfits are as sharp as we are, and they may have a few agents here on Ceres that we know nothing about.\" \"So? What does this have to do with me?\" He put his drink on the table. \"Oak, I want you to help me.\" His onyx-brown eyes, only a shade darker than his skin, looked directly into my own. \"I know it isn't part of your assignment, and you know I can't afford to pay you anything near what you're worth. It will have to come out of my [22] pocket because I couldn't possibly justify it from operating funds. Ravenhurst specifically told me that he doesn't want you messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he doesn't like your methods of operation.\" \"And you're going to go against his orders?\" \"I am.

I'm going to protect Ravenhurst's interests to the best of my ability, and that means that I'll use the best of other people's abilities if I can.\" I grinned at him. \"The last I heard, you were sore at me for blatting it all over Ceres that Jaqueline Ravenhurst was missing, when she sneaked aboard McGuire.\" He nodded perfunctorily. \"I was. I still think you should have told me what you were up to. But you did it, and you got results that I'd been unable to get. I'm not going to let a momentary pique hang on as an irrational dislike. I like to think I have more sense than that.\" \"Thanks.\" There wasn't much else I could say. \"Now, I've got a little dough put away; it's not much, but I could offer you—\" I shook my head, cutting him off. \"Nope. Sorry, Brock. For two reasons. In the first place, there would be a conflict of interest. I'm working for Ravenhurst, and if he doesn't want [23] me to work for you, then it would be unethical for me to take the job. \"In the second place, my fees are standardized. Oh, I can allow a certain amount of fluctuation, but I'm not a physician or a lawyer; my services are [24] not necessary to the survival of the individual, except in very rare cases, and those cases are generally arranged through a lawyer when it's a charity case. \"No, colonel, I'm afraid I couldn't [25] possibly work for you.\" He thought that over for a long time. Finally, he nodded his head very slowly. \"I see. Yeah, I get your point.\" He scowled down at his drink. \" But ,\" I said, \"it would be a pleasure [26] to work with you.\" He looked up quickly. \"How's that?\" \"Well, let's look at it this way: You can't hire me because I'm already working for Ravenhurst; I can't hire [27] you because you're working for Ravenhurst. But since we may need each other, and since we're both working for Ravenhurst, there would be no conflict of interest if we co-operate. \"Or, to put it another way, I can't take money for any service I may render you, but you can pay off in services. Am I coming through?\" His broad smile made the scars on his face fold in and deepen. \"Loud and clear. It's a deal.\" I held up a hand, palm toward him. \"Ah, ah, ah! There's no 'deal' involved.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The chance of mass slaughter was their eternal nightmare. How black is the blackest treachery? Is the most callous traitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision? That at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero. Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when he reached the village. He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing, parching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's unicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred miles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius' second planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like a magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body. He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on his gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the single well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick house, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof now, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed in a Kumaji raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest time as a boy. He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked as he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and brought the ladle to his lips. He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish. Poisoned. He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost gagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen and rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with the poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's house. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the saline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table was set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last night's partially-consumed dinner still on the table. The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of the moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth—too late for anything. He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring at him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard scurried away. \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called. Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center, a Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and sweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin, which had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black. Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost spasmodically to get the water down.

His purple skin, which had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black. Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost spasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the canteen and said: \"What happened here?\" \"They're gone. All gone.\" \"Yes, but what happened?\" \"The Kumaji—\" \"You're Kumaji.\" \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now they're gone.\" \"But you stayed here—\" \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too old to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_2#0", "contents": "Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\" Actually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century Earth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were sought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The Kumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life on the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one oasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy, Kumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about the raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government, so far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had suggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since a colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions, almost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves. \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded. \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji said in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The well was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go, and go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\" \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City, built at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the surface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground, was almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of trackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat.... \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women and children. The Kumaji are after them.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_3#0", "contents": "Steve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could find some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way he felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists, trekking across a parched wilderness—to the safety of Oasis City—or death. \"Come on,\" Steve said, making up his mind. \"The unicopter can hold two in a pinch.\" \"You're going after them?\" \"I've got to. They're my people. I've been away too long.\" \"Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember.\" \"Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell.\" \"I'm not going anyplace, young fellow.\" \"But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without—\" \"I'm staying,\" the old man said, still without self-pity, just matter-of-factly. \"The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame 'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good, long life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll need every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?\" \"No,\" Steve said. \"Too bad. Well, good-bye and good luck.\" \"But you can't—\" \"Oh, I'm staying. I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home I'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow.\" Slowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small metal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It could do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet."}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_4#0", "contents": "Steve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back to the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be refused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself airborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again. The old man's voice called after him: \"Tell the people ... hurry ... Kumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe out their trail ... but hurry....\" The voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind. Steve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on hate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people. Hours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and wasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and a whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the slow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's Middle East—and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here on the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of burden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked beside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with the swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands with agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve could see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to ride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five hundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them.... \"Hullo!\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding clumsily through the sand toward him. \"Cantwell's the name,\" Steve said. \"I'm one of you.\" Bleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \"Cantwell. Yeah, I remember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh, no. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing here now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\" The bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias Whiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a boy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in his eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in his mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was well-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a big muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had hardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve Cantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the Kumajis, and had grown rich—by colony standards—at his business. Now, Steve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the others—either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a new colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation. Perhaps that explained his bitterness. \"So you've"}

Perhaps that explained his bitterness. \"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\" The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly. They hardly seemed to be moving at all. \"Is my aunt all right?\" Steve said. She was the only family he remembered. Tobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \"I hate to be the one to tell you this. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died from the poisoned water last night.\" For a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was pity—pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death. Sadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness."}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_5#0", "contents": "The caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl. She wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face—it would be a pretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized—was etched with lines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. \"Who is he, Dad?\" the girl said. \"Young Cantwell. Remember?\" So this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten years ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly. She was a woman now.... \"Steve Cantwell?\" Mary said. \"Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I—I'm sorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your aunt. If there's anything I can do....\" Steve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a slim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time like this was little short of amazing, especially since it was completely genuine. He appreciated it. Tobias Whiting said: \"Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get along with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know that.\" He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. \"But I never got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be poor again. We could have been rich.\" Steve asked, \"What happened to all your profits?\" \"Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll never see it again.\" Mary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to her. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding and hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up to recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias Whiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of them, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming. But Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was comforting and reassuring."}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_6#0", "contents": "Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared. The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day. Their water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to reach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of fatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be done for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always slaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still four hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking Steve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the turbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but had assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had done so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji. \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\" At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the day before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money—with the Kumaji.\" None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying anything, and Steve squeezed her hand. \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said. \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the colony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for that money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the Kumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\" \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said. \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must have happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally decided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's 'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the Kumaji, they won't just give it to him—not by a long sight.\" \"No?\" someone asked. \"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like that without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll make the trade.\" His voice reflected some bitterness."}
{"chunk_id": "HOME_IS_WHERE_YOU_LEFT_IT_7#0", "contents": "Mary went to Gort and slapped his face. The elderly man did not even blink. \"Well,\" he asked her gently, \"did your pa tell you he was going?\" \"N-no,\" Mary said. There were tears in her eyes, but she did not cry. Gort turned to Steve. \"Cantwell, can he get far in that 'copter?\" Steve shook his head. \"Ten or fifteen miles is all. Almost out of fuel, Mr. Gort. You saw how I took her up for only a quick mile swing each day. He won't get far.\" \"He'll crash in the desert?\" \"Crash or crash-land,\" Steve said. Mary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent. \"We've got to stop him,\" Gort said. \"And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji, they'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never fight them off without the protection of our village. Near as I can figure, there's a Kumaji base fifty miles due north of here. Whiting knows it too, so that's where he'll be going, I figure. Can't spare more than a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find us—or are led to us—and attack.\" Steve said, \"I should have taken something out of the 'copter every night, so it couldn't start. I'll go.\" Mary came forward boldly. \"I have to go. He's my father. If he crashed out there, he may be hurt. He may be—dying.\" Gort looked at her. \"And if he's trying to sell us out to the Kumajis?\" \"Then—then I'll do whatever Steve asks me to. I promise.\" \"That's good enough for me,\" Steve said. A few minutes later, armed with atorifles and their share of the food and water that was left, Steve and Mary set out northward across the sand while the caravan continued east. Fear of what they might find mounted."}

On the third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji settlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or thlotback , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the sands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding. Steve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond grew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out here with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her heart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in order to regain his fortune. On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and made their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had expected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he escaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the Kumaji encampment by now. \"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\" Mary said. The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of the rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there. \"No,\" Steve said. \"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it all right.\" \"To go—to them?\" \"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm sorry.\" \"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What can we do?\" \"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\" \"North?\" \"North.\" \"And if by some miracle we find him?\" Steve said nothing. The answer—capture or death—was obvious. But you couldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you? As it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own efforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were spotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on their thlots . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel aside. \"They'd kill us,\" he said. \"We can only surrender.\" They were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken that way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular tent. Tobias Whiting was in there."}

To ... to kill you if necessary.\" \"Mary....\" \"Oh, Dad, why did you do it? Why?\" \"We couldn't start all over again, could we? You have a right to live the sort of life I planned for you. You....\" \"Whiting,\" Steve said, \"did you tell them yet?\" \"No. No, I haven't. I have information to trade, sure. But I want to make sure it's going to the right people. I want to get our....\" \"Dad! Our money, and all those deaths?\" \"It doesn't matter now. I—I had changed my mind, Mary. Truly. But now, now that you're a prisoner, what if I don't talk? Don't you see, they'll torture you. They'll make you talk. And that way—we get nothing. I couldn't stand to see them hurt you.\" \"They can do—what they think they have to do. I'll tell them nothing.\" \"You won't have to,\" Whiting said. \"I'll tell them when we reach the larger settlement. They're taking us there tomorrow, they told me.\" \"Then we've got to get out of here tonight,\" Steve said. The low sun cast the shadow of their guard against the thlot skin wall of their tent. He was a single man, armed with a long, pike-like weapon. When darkness came, if the guard were not increased.... They were brought a pasty gruel for their supper, and ate in silence and distaste, ate because they needed the strength. Mary said, \"Dad, I don't want you to tell them anything. Dad, please. If you thought you were doing it for me....\" \"I've made up my mind,\" Tobias Whiting said. Mary turned to Steve, in despair. \"Steve,\" she said. \"Steve. Do—whatever you have to do. I—I'll understand.\" Steve didn't answer her. Wasn't Whiting right now? he thought. If Steve silenced him, wouldn't the Kumaji torture them for the information? Steve could stand up to it perhaps—but he couldn't stand to see them hurt Mary. He'd talk if they did that.... Then silencing Whiting wasn't the answer. But the Kumajis had one willing prisoner and two unwilling ones. They knew that. If the willing one yelled for help but the yelling was kept to a minimum so only one guard, the man outside, came...."}

Far off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert. \"Are you asleep?\" Mary asked. \"No,\" Steve said. \"Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing—like a baby. As if—as if he wasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!\" Steve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's voice surprised him. \"I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I—\" \"I'm going to kill you,\" Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting. He paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as Steve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat and closed there—not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again. Sand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside. Steve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies. The pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against Steve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the thick-muscled neck, clamped there—squeezing. The guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed out wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the guard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp seemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening fingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard—or death for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek another."}

The guard stabbed out awkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned, but Steve hardly heard him. When the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was either dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve had never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to kill attacked a man.... \"Steve!\" It was Mary, calling his name and crying. \"It's Dad. Dad was—hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad—\" Steve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out Tobias Whiting's pain-contorted face. \"My stomach,\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \"The pain....\" Steve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He couldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He touched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying softly. \"You two ...\" Whiting gasped. \"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is—he—what you want?\" \"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\" \"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\" \"I think so,\" Steve said. \"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them—due south. The Earthmen are heading due south. They'll go—south. They won't find the caravan. You'll—all—get away. If it's—what you want, Mary.\" She leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \"Isn't there anything we can do for him?\" Steve shook his head. \"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to deceive them.\" \"I'll live long enough,\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he would. \"Luck to—all of you. From a—very foolish—man....\""}

He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the sand to where the thlots were hobbled for the night. He hardly remembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary death. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the thlots . The animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night to see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he decapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the other's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In the darkness he flung Mary on the thlot's bare back in front of him, and they glided off across the sand. Pursuit was disorganized—and unsuccessful. It was too dark for effective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all night and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any direction. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail. Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said, \"Steve, do you have to tell them?\" \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death, sending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\" \"And not—not what he'd planned to do at first.\" \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can make a mistake, can't he?\" \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\" Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all reach Oasis City in safety. With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Every lonely man tries to make friends. Manet just didn't know when to stop! William Manet was alone. In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It would give him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate loneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him to start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin teaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable lectures to a bored and captive audience of one. He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether it was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as dirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and think more like a god than any man for generations. But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing bore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it. Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already talking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had cut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and winked at it whenever he passed that way. Lately she was winking back at him. Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from his arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity. No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet could only be this lonely on Mars. Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human. All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle of the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat, flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the black sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons and one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole gimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was needed here—no human being, at least. The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't take much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully specified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb Mars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization. They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people for the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to isolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet and his fellows. The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare to Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter service for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations for couples when the law specified only one occupant."}

Passenger fare to Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter service for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations for couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't providing fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between the various Overseers. They weren't very providential. But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered wonderful opportunities. It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making a tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as bright as envy."}
{"chunk_id": "HOW_TO_MAKE_FRIENDS_2#0", "contents": "Manet suspected hallucination, but in an existence with all the pallid dispassion of a requited love he was happy to welcome dementia. Sometimes he even manufactured it. Sometimes he would run through the arteries of the factory and play that it had suddenly gone mad hating human beings, and was about to close down its bulkheads on him as sure as the Engineers' Thumb and bale up the pressure-dehydrated digest, making so much stall flooring of him. He ran until he dropped with a kind of climaxing release of terror. So Manet put on the pressure suit he had been given because he would never need it, and marched out to meet the visiting spaceship. He wasn't quite clear how he came from walking effortlessly across the Martian plain that had all the distance-perpetuating qualities of a kid's crank movie machine to the comfortable interior of a strange cabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin. The black and orange Hallowe'en log charring in the slate stone fireplace seemed real. So did the lean man with the smiling mustache painted with the random designs of the fire, standing before the horizontal pattern of chinked wall. \"Need a fresher?\" the host inquired. Manet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber whiskey full of sparks from the hearth. He stirred himself in the comfortingly warm leather chair. \"No, no, I'm fine .\" He let the word hang there for examination. \"Pardon me, but could you tell me just what place this is?\" The host shrugged. It was the only word for it. \"Whatever place you choose it to be, so long as you're with Trader Tom. 'Service,' that's my motto. It is a way of life with me.\" \"Trader Tom? Service?\" \"Yes! That's it exactly. It's me exactly. Trader Tom Service—Serving the Wants of the Spaceman Between the Stars. Of course, 'stars' is poetic. Any point of light in the sky in a star. We service the planets.\" Manet took the tumbler in both hands and drank. It was good whiskey, immensely powerful. \"The government wouldn't pay for somebody serving the wants of spacemen,\" he exploded. \"Ah,\" Trader Tom said, cautionary. He moved nearer the fire and warmed his hands and buttocks. \"Ah, but I am not a government service. I represent free enterprise.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HOW_TO_MAKE_FRIENDS_3#0", "contents": "\"Nonsense,\" Manet said. \"No group of private individuals can build a spaceship. It takes a combine of nations.\" \"But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known. Ask anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the capitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper. They play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things they can forego the papers. Comprehend, mon ami ? My businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw materials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they make it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals.\" \"I don't believe you,\" Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown blunt with disuse. \"What possible profit could your principals turn from running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the planets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't already supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for it? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this glass of whiskey.\" \"Do you find it good whiskey?\" \"Very good.\" \"Excellent?\" \"Excellent, if you prefer.\" \"I only meant—but never mind. We give you what you want. As for paying for it—why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a Trader Tom Credit Card.\" \"And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?\" Manet demanded. \"That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it.\" \"That's it precisely!\" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. \"You never pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your estate .\" \"But I may leave no estate!\" Trader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. \"All businesses operate on a certain margin of risk. That is our worry.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HOW_TO_MAKE_FRIENDS_4#0", "contents": "Manet finished the mellow whiskey and looked into the glass. It seemed to have been polished clean. \"What do you have to offer?\" \"Whatever you want?\" Irritably, \"How do I know what I want until I know what you have?\" \"You know.\" \"I know? All right, I know. You don't have it for sale.\" \"Old chap, understand if you please that I do not only sell . I am a trader—Trader Tom. I trade with many parties. There are, for example ... extraterrestrials.\" \"Folk legend!\" \"On the contrary, mon cher , the only reality it lacks is political reality. The Assembly could no longer justify their disposition of the cosmos if it were known they were dealing confiscation without representation. Come, tell me what you want.\" Manet gave in to it. \"I want to be not alone,\" he said. \"Of course,\" Trader Tom replied, \"I suspected. It is not so unusual, you know. Sign here. And here. Two copies. This is yours. Thank you so much.\" Manet handed back the pen and stared at the laminated card in his hand. When he looked up from the card, Manet saw the box. Trader Tom was pushing it across the floor towards him. The box had the general dimensions of a coffin, but it wasn't wood—only brightly illustrated cardboard. There was a large four-color picture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a busy city street. The red and blue letters said: LIFO The Socialization Kit \"It is commercialized,\" Trader Tom admitted with no little chagrin. \"It is presented to appeal to a twelve-year-old child, an erotic, aggressive twelve-year-old, the typical sensie goer—but that is reality. It offends men of good taste like ourselves, yet sometimes it approaches being art. We must accept it.\" \"What's the cost?\" Manet asked. \"Before I accept it, I have to know the charges.\" \"You never know the cost. Only your executor knows that. It's the Trader Tom plan.\" \"Well, is it guaranteed?\" \"There are no guarantees,\" Trader Tom admitted. \"But I've never had any complaints yet.\" \"Suppose I'm the first?\" Manet suggested reasonably. \"You won't be,\" Trader Tom said. \"I won't pass this way again.\""}

Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper taste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to himself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad. Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk, suppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the conclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad. So he went to open the box. The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It crumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the boxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed. The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old chemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and unremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to have been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime. On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the Reader's Digest , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in black on the spine and cover: The Making of Friends . Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title in larger print and slightly amplified: The Making of Friends and Others . There was no author listed. A further line of information stated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of the title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD., SYRACUSE. The unnumbered first chapter was headed Your First Friend . Before you go further, first find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital . He quickly riffled through the pages. Other Friends, Authority, A Companion .... Then The Final Model . Manet tried to flip past this section, but the pages after the sheet labeled The Final Model were stuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in the back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to this section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants. Manet flipped back to page one. First find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital to your entire experiment in socialization. The Modifier is Part #A-1 on the Master Chart. He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There was nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and looked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its outside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits. Maybe even the Modifier itself. He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He studied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand. The toe bone was connected to the foot bone.... The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner. The Black King"}

The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy. The Black King shuffled sideways. The Red King followed.... Uselessly. \"Tie game,\" Ronald said. \"Tie game,\" Manet said. \"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful. Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him. Cheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in order to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible. \"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said pontifically. \"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him. Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress. Intelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know any more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to that when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder. \"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said. \"I know.\" \"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the last of which took place near the end of the First World War. The aerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not seen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for single passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts, that this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the leisurely combats of World War One.\" \"I know.\" \"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be warm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.\" \"I know.\""}

He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel Boone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines, the painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing, ad nauseum . What a narrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought and concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal human being? Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy. Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties—Lt. \"Hoot\" Gibson, Sam Merwin tennis stories, Saturday Evening Post covers—when he had first learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm opinions on all these. He yearned for someone to challenge him—to say that Dime Sports had been nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why, Sewanee Review , there had been a magazine for you. Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his own. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior to the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a better band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk. \"Ronald,\" Manet said, \"you are a terrific jerk.\" Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right. Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross. Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel. The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the diesel works, closed again. Ronald leaped forward and led with his right. Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of Ronald's jaw. Ronald pinwheeled to the floor. He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth. \"Had enough?\" he asked Manet. Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. \"Yes.\" Ronald hopped up lightly. \"Another checkers, Billy Boy?\" \"No.\" \"Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.\" Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury. Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in a fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet wanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid. Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard. But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that their checker games always ended in a tie?"}

For a moment he gloried in the blatant display of his flabby muscles and patchy sunburn. Then he sighed, rolled over to his feet and started trudging toward Communication. He padded down the rib-ridged matted corridor, taking his usual small pleasure in the kaleidoscopic effect of the spiraling reflections on the walls of the tubeway. As he passed the File Room, he caught the sound of the pounding vibrations against the stoppered plug of the hatch. \"Come on, Billy Buddy, let me out of this place!\" Manet padded on down the hall. He had, he recalled, shoved Ronald in there on Lincoln's Birthday, a minor ironic twist he appreciated quietly. He had been waiting in vain for Ronald to run down ever since. In Communication, he took a seat and punched the slowed down playback of the transmission. \"Hello, Overseers,\" the Voice said. It was the Voice of the B.B.C. It irritated Manet. He never understood how the British had got the space transmissions assignment for the English language. He would have preferred an American disk-jockey himself, one who appreciated New York swing. \"We imagine that you are most interested in how long you shall be required to stay at your present stations,\" said the Voice of God's paternal uncle. \"As you on Mars may know, there has been much discussion as to how long it will require to complete the present schedule—\" there was of course no \"K\" sound in the word—\"for atmosphere seeding. \"The original, non-binding estimate at the time of your departure was 18.2 years. However, determining how long it will take our stations properly to remake the air of Mars is a problem comparable to finding the age of the Earth. Estimates change as new factors are learned.

The recent estimate by certain reactionary sources of two hundred and seventy-four years is not an official government estimate. The news for you is good, if you are becoming nostalgic for home, or not particularly bad if you are counting on drawing your handsome salary for the time spent on Mars. We have every reason to believe our original estimate was substantially correct.

He hated to think of Ronald locked in the Usher tomb of the File Room for 18 flat years. Long before that, he would have worn his fists away hammering at the hatch. Then he might start pounding with his head. Perhaps before the time was up he would have worn himself down to nothing whatsoever. Manet selected the ripple-finished gray-covered manual from the hodgepodge, and thought: eighteen years. Perhaps I should have begun here, he told himself. But I really don't have as much interest in that sort of thing as the earthier types. Simple companionship was all I wanted. And, he thought on, even an insipid personality like Ronald's would be bearable with certain compensations. Manet opened the book to the chapter headed: The Making of a Girl ."}

It was finished even before the last of the jet pilots.\" \"Don't be silly,\" she snapped. \"If it were over, I'd know about it, wouldn't I?\" She would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright, less equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald. Whoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what constituted appropriate \"feminine\" characteristics. \"I suppose,\" he said heavily, \"that you would like me to take you back to Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Veronica, your stupidity is hideous.\" She lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. \"That is a mean thing to say to me. But I forgive you.\" An invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head until it forced a sound out of him. \"Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so cloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight in you at all?\" He stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw. It was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized regretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago. Veronica sprang forward and led with a right."}

{"chunk_id": "HOW_TO_MAKE_FRIENDS_9#0", "contents": "Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the corridor. \"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth. \"No, darling.\" Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore the noise. She was still following orders. \"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried through sepulchrally. \"Shut up!\" Manet yelled. The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off. A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it. Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took comfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the station. Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch. Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His hands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips seemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the shouting but from having nothing to drink for some months. Ronald didn't say anything to Manet. But he looked offended. \"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back, \"inside, inside.\" Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl. \"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going to lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year, forever! Now what do you think about that?\" \"If you think it's the right thing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly. \"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly. Manet slammed the hatch in disgust. Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of his reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk carefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he walked too carefully for this to happen. As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion, William, you should let us out.\" \"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill, dearest.\" Manet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you back after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\" He went down the corridor, giggling. He giggled and thought: This will never do."}
{"chunk_id": "HOW_TO_MAKE_FRIENDS_10#0", "contents": "Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual diligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the box to go around. The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The Model Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit. He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make any one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier. He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from him for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit. Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit. But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once. Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did so, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet. He glanced forward and found the headings: The Final Model . There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid a price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to that? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he could. He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of ill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and under his fingers.... Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back. Victor was finished. Perfect. Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose. \"Move!\" Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the flesh-sprayers. As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized that it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier. \"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\" Manet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\" Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should understand. I am different from the others.\" \"They all say that.\" \"I am not your friend.\" \"No?\" \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\" Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure at the symmetry of the situation. \"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I am your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have all your knowledge. You do not have all your knowledge. If you let yourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is my function to use everything I possibly can against you.\" \"When do you start?\" \"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\" \"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest. \"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never change. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your interest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll never change. We don't change and you can't change us for others.

Yes.\" \"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see me suffer?\" \" Yes. \" \"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't. I know. You're too human, too like me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state of uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be happening to him. He has to be happening to something.

That's your function.\" \"Stop talking and just think about your miserable life,\" Victor said meanly. \"Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make any new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your uselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that for boredom, for passiveness?\" \"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Manet said irritably, his social manners rusty. \"I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your purpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend!\""}

He moved his shoulders. \"I don't know, but maybe they range this far. Maybe they're on this side of the ridge, too.\" Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. \"I'd hate to lose a day crossing the ridge,\" he said. \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. \"Listen!\" \"Eh?\" Extrone said. \"Hear it? That cough? I think that's one, from over there. Right up ahead of us.\" Extrone raised his eyebrows. This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct. \"It is!\" Ri said. \"It's a farn beast, all right!\" Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. \"I'm glad we won't have to cross the ridge.\" Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. \"Yes, sir.\" \"We'll pitch camp right here, then,\" Extrone said. \"We'll go after it tomorrow.\" He looked at the sky. \"Have the bearers hurry.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. \"You, there!\" he called. \"Pitch camp, here!\" He crossed to Mia, who, along with him, had been pressed into Extrone's party as guides. Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, \"Be quick, now!\" And to Mia, \"God almighty, he was getting mad.\" He ran a hand under his collar. \"It's a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'd hate to think of making him climb that ridge.\" Mia glanced nervously over his shoulder. \"It's that damned pilot's fault for setting us down on this side. I told him it was the other side. I told him so.\" Ri shrugged hopelessly. Mia said, \"I don't think he even saw a blast area over here. I think he wanted to get us in trouble.\" \"There shouldn't be one. There shouldn't be a blast area on this side of the ridge, too.\" \"That's what I mean. The pilot don't like businessmen. He had it in for us.\" Ri cleared his throat nervously. \"Maybe you're right.\" \"It's the Hunting Club he don't like.\" \"I wish to God I'd never heard of a farn beast,\" Ri said. \"At least, then, I wouldn't be one of his guides.

I could buy half this planet, and he makes me his guide—at less than I pay my secretary.\" \"Well, anyway, we won't have to cross that ridge.\" \"Hey, you!\" Extrone called. The two of them turned immediately. \"You two scout ahead,\" Extrone said. \"See if you can pick up some tracks.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said, and instantly the two of them readjusted their shoulder straps and started off. Shortly they were inside of the scrub forest, safe from sight. \"Let's wait here,\" Mia said. \"No, we better go on. He may have sent a spy in.\" They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not professional guides. \"We don't want to get too near,\" Ri said after toiling through the forest for many minutes. \"Without guns, we don't want to get near enough for the farn beast to charge us.\" They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging. \"He'll want the bearers to hack a path for him,\" Mia said. \"But we go it alone. Damn him.\" Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. \"Hot. By God, it's hot. I didn't think it was this hot, the first time we were here.\" Mia said, \"The first time, we weren't guides. We didn't notice it so much then.\" They fought a few yards more into the forest. Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay a blast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but the tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath. \"This isn't ours!\" Ri said. \"This looks like it was made nearly a year ago!\" Mia's eyes narrowed. \"The military from Xnile?\" \"No,\" Ri said. \"They don't have any rockets this small. And I don't think there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we leased from the Club. Except the one he brought.\" \"The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?\" Mia asked. \"You think it's their blast?\" \"So?\" Ri said. \"But who are they?\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_3#0", "contents": "It was Mia's turn to shrug. \"Whoever they were, they couldn't have been hunters. They'd have kept the secret better.\" \"We didn't do so damned well.\" \"We didn't have a chance,\" Mia objected. \"Everybody and his brother had heard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn't our fault Extrone found out.\" \"I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead of us.\" Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"We should have shot our pilot, too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who told Extrone we'd hunted this area.\" \"I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.\" \"After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to the alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.\" There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip. \" I didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking,\" Mia said. Ri's mouth twisted. \"I didn't say you did.\" \"Listen,\" Mia said in a hoarse whisper. \"I just thought. Listen. To hell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us, too, when the hunt's over.\" Ri licked his lips. \"No. He wouldn't do that. We're not—not just anybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even him . And besides, why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Too many people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.\" Mia said, \"I hope you're right.\" They stood side by side, studying the blast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, \"We better be getting back.\" \"What'll we tell him?\" \"That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?\" They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines. \"It gets hotter at sunset,\" Ri said nervously. \"The breeze dies down.\" \"It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. There must be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.\" \"There may be a pass,\" Mia said, pushing a vine away. Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. \"I guess that's it. If there were a lot of them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it's damned funny, when you think about it.\" Mia looked up at the darkening sky. \"We better hurry,\" he said."}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_4#0", "contents": "When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low, obviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the outpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the blazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over Extrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled into the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its blasts. Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat disgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers. Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking officers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce, the officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and knees almost stiff. \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked. They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began. \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone demanded, ominously not raising his voice. \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship. It was sighted a few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\" Extrone's face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there, gentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?\" \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\" \"So?\" Extrone mocked. \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could locate and destroy it.\" Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned away, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring me a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I'm staying here.\" The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\" Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was an alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it, didn't you?\" \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\" \"You'll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said. \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a long range bombardment, sir.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_5#0", "contents": "Extrone said, \"To begin with, they probably don't even know I'm here. And they probably couldn't hit this area if they did know. And you can't afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.\" \"That's why we'd like you to return to an inner planet, sir.\" Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. \"You'll lose a fleet before you'll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen. I'm quite safe here, I think.\" The bearer brought Extrone his drink. \"Get off,\" Extrone said quietly to the four officers. Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back. Instead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the tangle of forest. Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area, casting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot breath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars. Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed the empty glass away, listened for it to shatter. He reached out, parted the heavy flap to his tent. \"Sir?\" Ri said, hurrying toward him in the gathering darkness. \"Eh?\" Extrone said, turning, startled. \"Oh, you. Well?\" \"We ... located signs of the farn beast, sir. To the east.\" Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, \"You killed one, I believe, on your trip?\" Ri shifted. \"Yes, sir.\" Extrone held back the flap of the tent. \"Won't you come in?\" he asked without any politeness whatever. Ri obeyed the order. The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky feathers, costly of transport space, the sleep curtains of silken gauze. The floor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly and smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the left of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals. They tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was electric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to the bed, sat down. \"You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?\" he said. \"I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_6#0", "contents": "Extrone narrowed his eyes. \"I see by your eyes that you are envious—that is the word, isn't it?—of my tent.\" Ri looked away from his face. \"Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have never killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't seen a farn beast.\" Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone's glittering ones. \"Few people have seen them, sir.\" \"Oh?\" Extrone questioned mildly. \"I wouldn't say that. I understand that the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of their planets.\" \"I meant in our system, sir.\" \"Of course you did,\" Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of his sleeve with his forefinger. \"I imagine these are the only farn beasts in our system.\" Ri waited uneasily, not answering. \"Yes,\" Extrone said, \"I imagine they are. It would have been a shame if you had killed the last one. Don't you think so?\" Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. \"Yes, sir. It would have been.\" Extrone pursed his lips. \"It wouldn't have been very considerate of you to—But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed to come along as my guide.\" \"It was an honor, sir.\" Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. \"If I had waited until it was safe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to find such an illustrious guide.\" \"... I'm flattered, sir.\" \"Of course,\" Extrone said. \"But you should have spoken to me about it, when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.\" \"I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity, sir....\" \"Of course,\" Extrone said dryly. \"Like all of my subjects,\" he waved his hand in a broad gesture, \"the highest as well as the lowest slave, know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.\" Ri squirmed, his face pale. \"We do indeed love you, sir.\" Extrone bent forward. \" Know me and love me.\" \"Yes, sir. Know you and love you, sir,\" Ri said. \"Get out!\" Extrone said."}

The two of them, beneath the leaf-swollen branches of the gnarled tree, were seated on their sleeping bags. The moon was clear and cold and bright in a cloudless sky; a small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a central mountain ridge that bisected it into almost twin hemispheres. \"To think of him. As flesh and blood. Not like the—well; that—what we've read about.\" Mia glanced suspiciously around him at the shadows. \"You begin to understand a lot of things, after seeing him.\" Ri picked nervously at the cover of his sleeping bag. \"It makes you think,\" Mia added. He twitched. \"I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll.... Listen, we'll talk. When we get back to civilization. You, me, the bearers. About him. He can't let that happen. He'll kill us first.\" Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. \"No. We have friends. We have influence. He couldn't just like that—\" \"He could say it was an accident.\" \"No,\" Ri said stubbornly. \"He can say anything,\" Mia insisted. \"He can make people believe anything. Whatever he says. There's no way to check on it.\" \"It's getting cold,\" Ri said. \"Listen,\" Mia pleaded. \"No,\" Ri said. \"Even if we tried to tell them, they wouldn't listen. Everybody would know we were lying. Everything they've come to believe would tell them we were lying. Everything they've read, every picture they've seen. They wouldn't believe us. He knows that.\" \"Listen,\" Mia repeated intently. \"This is important. Right now he couldn't afford to let us talk. Not right now. Because the Army is not against him. Some officers were here, just before we came back. A bearer overheard them talking. They don't want to overthrow him!\" Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering. \"That's another lie,\" Mia continued. \"That he protects the people from the Army. That's a lie. I don't believe they were ever plotting against him. Not even at first. I think they helped him, don't you see?\" Ri whined nervously. \"It's like this,\" Mia said. \"I see it like this. The Army put him in power when the people were in rebellion against military rule.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_8#0", "contents": "Ri swallowed. \"We couldn't make the people believe that.\" \"No?\" Mia challenged. \"Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow? You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the alien system!\" \"The people won't support them,\" Ri answered woodenly. \" Think. If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.\" Ri looked around at the shadows. \"That explains a lot of things,\" Mia said. \"I think the Army's been preparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's why Extrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from learning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep them from exposing him to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooled like we were, so easy.\" \"No!\" Ri snapped. \"It was to keep the natural economic balance.\" \"You know that's not right.\" Ri lay down on his bed roll. \"Don't talk about it. It's not good to talk like this. I don't even want to listen.\" \"When the invasion starts, he'll have to command all their loyalties. To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then. He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to tell the truth.\" \"You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.\" Mia smiled twistedly. \"How many has he already killed? How can we even guess?\" Ri swallowed sickly. \"Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?\" Ri shuddered. \"That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all like that.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_9#0", "contents": "With morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells. The air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike, uncontaminated. And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the flap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep. \"Breakfast!\" he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding table and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of various foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher and a drinking mug. Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in his conversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth with water and spat on the ground. \"Lin!\" he said. His personal bearer came loping toward him. \"Have you read that manual I gave you?\" Lin nodded. \"Yes.\" Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. \"Very ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for guides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me, twenty years ago, damn them.\" Lin waited. \"Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.\" \"The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,\" Lin said. \"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?\" \"I believe they're carnivorous, sir.\" \"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only information on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual—and, of course, two businessmen.\" \"They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of tearing a man—\" \"An alien?\" Extrone corrected. \"There's not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an alien to pieces, sir.\" Extrone laughed harshly. \"It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?\" Lin's face remained impassive. \"I guess it seems that way. Sir.\" \"Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,\" Extrone said. \"But you're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?\" Lin shrugged. \"Maybe.\" \"I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know how wonderful it feels to have people all afraid of you.\" \"The farn beasts, according to the manual....\" \"You are very insistent on one subject.\" \"... It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I was saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of aliens. Sir.\" \"All right,\" Extrone said, annoyed. \"I'll be careful.\" In the distance, a farn beast coughed. Instantly alert, Extrone said, \"Get the bearers! Have some of them cut a path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get the hell over here!\" Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt."}

Extrone walked leisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at the vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their sharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy breathing. Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank deeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made oppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air. Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen fought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks for farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the tree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near. Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a powerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained fire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a folding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered two-way communication set. Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny, arboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to Extrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur. When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers slump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume, he sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted, reflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs. \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie. \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be important.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The bearer twiddled the dials. \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother me?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't you?\" \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right in the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\" \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone tore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back, find out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's important.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and perspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands. Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining bearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes. \"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About a quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\" Extrone's eyes lit with passion. Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I think.\" \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward and look at the spoor.\" Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\" Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood up. \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\""}

When they came to the tracks, heavily pressed into drying mud around a small watering hole, Extrone nodded his head in satisfaction. \"This way,\" Lin said, pointing, and once more the two of them started off. They went a good distance through the forest, Extrone becoming more alert with each additional foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with a restraining hand. \"They may be quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought to bring up the column?\" The farn beast, somewhere beyond a ragged clump of bushes, coughed. Extrone clenched the blast rifle convulsively. The farn beast coughed again, more distant this time. \"They're moving away,\" Lin said. \"Damn!\" Extrone said. \"It's a good thing the wind's right, or they'd be coming back, and fast, too.\" \"Eh?\" Extrone said. \"They charge on scent, sight, or sound. I understand they will track down a man for as long as a day.\" \"Wait,\" Extrone said, combing his beard. \"Wait a minute.\" \"Yes?\" \"Look,\" Extrone said. \"If that's the case, why do we bother tracking them? Why not make them come to us?\" \"They're too unpredictable. It wouldn't be safe. I'd rather have surprise on our side.\" \"You don't seem to see what I mean,\" Extrone said. \" We won't be the—ah—the bait.\" \"Oh?\" \"Let's get back to the column.\""}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_12#0", "contents": "\"Extrone wants to see you,\" Lin said. Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy. \"What's he want to see me for?\" \"I don't know,\" Lin said curtly. Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously at Lin's bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have—a little money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to do anything to me—I'd pay you, if you could....\" \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning. Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound, ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where Extrone was seated, petting his rifle. Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me what they look like,\" he said suddenly. \"Well, sir, they're ... uh....\" \"Pretty frightening?\" \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\" \"But you weren't afraid of them, were you?\" \"No, sir. No, because....\" Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good. I want you to do something for me.\" \"I ... I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye. Lin's face was impassive. \"Of course you will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin. A good, long, strong rope.\" \"What are you going to do?\" Ri asked, terrified. \"Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as bait.\" \"No!\" \"Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream—you can scream, by the way?\" Ri swallowed. \"We could find a way to make you.\" There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop, creeping toward his nose. \"You'll be safe,\" Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. \"I'll shoot the animal before it reaches you.\" Ri gulped for air. \"But ... if there should be more than one?\" Extrone shrugged. \"I—Look, sir. Listen to me.\" Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands were trembling. \"It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir. He killed a farn beast before I did, sir. And last night—last night, he—\" \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently. Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir. That's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you. He's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident, sir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I wouldn't....\" Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\" \"That one. Right over there.\" \"The one with his back to me?\" \"Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.\" Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle and said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\" Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\" Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\" \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don't want to use me, sir.

{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_13#0", "contents": "They were at the watering hole—Extrone, Lin, two bearers, and Ri. Since the hole was drying, the left, partially exposed bank was steep toward the muddy water. Upon it was green, new grass, tender-tuffed, half mashed in places by heavy animal treads. It was there that they staked him out, tying the free end of the rope tightly around the base of a scaling tree. \"You will scream,\" Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed across the water hole. \"The farn beast will come from this direction, I imagine.\" Ri was almost slobbering in fear. \"Let me hear you scream,\" Extrone said. Ri moaned weakly. \"You'll have to do better than that.\" Extrone inclined his head toward a bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see. Ri screamed. \"See that you keep it up that way,\" Extrone said. \"That's the way I want you to sound.\" He turned toward Lin. \"We can climb this tree, I think.\" Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark peeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly. Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert. Lin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller crotch. Looking down, Extrone said, \"Scream!\" Then, to Lin, \"You feel the excitement? It's always in the air like this at a hunt.\" \"I feel it,\" Lin said. Extrone chuckled. \"You were with me on Meizque?\" \"Yes.\" \"That was something, that time.\" He ran his hand along the stock of the weapon. The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled Extrone's head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet, underlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri's screams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly. Lin sat quiet, hunched. Extrone's eyes narrowed, and he began to pet the gun stock with quick, jerky movements. Lin licked his lips, keeping his eyes on Extrone's face. The sun seemed stuck in the sky, and the heat squeezed against them, sucking at their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away. Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed."}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_14#0", "contents": "A farn beast coughed, far in the matted forest. Extrone laughed nervously. \"He must have heard.\" \"We're lucky to rouse one so fast,\" Lin said. Extrone dug his boot cleats into the tree, braced himself. \"I like this. There's more excitement in waiting like this than in anything I know.\" Lin nodded. \"The waiting, itself, is a lot. The suspense. It's not only the killing that matters.\" \"It's not only the killing,\" Lin echoed. \"You understand?\" Extrone said. \"How it is to wait, knowing in just a minute something is going to come out of the forest, and you're going to kill it?\" \"I know,\" Lin said. \"But it's not only the killing. It's the waiting, too.\" The farn beast coughed again; nearer. \"It's a different one,\" Lin said. \"How do you know?\" \"Hear the lower pitch, the more of a roar?\" \"Hey!\" Extrone shouted. \"You, down there. There are two coming. Now let's hear you really scream!\" Ri, below, whimpered childishly and began to retreat toward the tether tree, his eyes wide. \"There's a lot of satisfaction in fooling them, too,\" Extrone said. \"Making them come to your bait, where you can get at them.\" He opened his right hand. \"Choose your ground, set your trap. Bait it.\" He snapped his hand into a fist, held the fist up before his eyes, imprisoning the idea. \"Spring the trap when the quarry is inside. Clever. That makes the waiting more interesting. Waiting to see if they really will come to your bait.\" Lin shifted, staring toward the forest. \"I've always liked to hunt,\" Extrone said. \"More than anything else, I think.\" Lin spat toward the ground. \"People should hunt because they have to. For food. For safety.\" \"No,\" Extrone argued. \"People should hunt for the love of hunting.\" \"Killing?\" \"Hunting,\" Extrone repeated harshly."}
{"chunk_id": "HUNT_the_HUNTER_15#0", "contents": "The farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and there was a noise of crackling underbrush. \"He's good bait,\" Extrone said. \"He's fat enough and he knows how to scream good.\" Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully eying the forest across from the watering hole. Extrone began to tremble with excitement. \"Here they come!\" The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his lap. The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank, swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed. Its mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs behind them, rattling leaves. \"Shoot!\" Lin hissed. \"For God's sake, shoot!\" \"Wait,\" Extrone said. \"Let's see what they do.\" He had not moved the rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump. The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head. \"Look!\" Extrone cried excitedly. \"Here it comes!\" Ri began to scream again. Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin waited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination. The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing a sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri. \"Watch! Watch!\" Extrone cried gleefully. And then the aliens sprang their trap."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"What's in a name?\" might be very dangerous to ask in certain societies, in which sticks and stones are also a big problem! I fought to be awake. I was dreaming, but I think I must have blushed. I must have blushed in my sleep. \" Do it! \" she said. \" Please do it! For me! \" It was the voice that always came, low, intense, seductive, the sound of your hand on silk ... and to a citizen of Northem, a conformist, it was shocking. I was a conformist then; I was still one that morning. I awoke. The glowlight was on, slowly increasing. I was in my living machine in Center Four, where I belonged, and all the familiar things were about me, reality was back, but I was breathing very hard. I lay on the pneumo a while before getting up. I looked at the chroner: 0703 hours, Day 17, Month IX, New Century Three. My morning nuro-tablets had already popped from the tube, and the timer had begun to boil an egg. The egg was there because the realfood allotment had been increased last month. The balance of trade with Southem had just swung a decimal or two our way. I rose finally, stepped to the mirror, switched it to positive and looked at myself. New wrinkles—or maybe just a deepening of the old ones. It was beginning to show; the past two years were leaving traces. I hadn't worried about my appearance when I'd been with the Office of Weapons. There, I'd been able to keep pretty much to myself, doing research on magnetic mechanics as applied to space drive. But other jobs, where you had to be among people, might be different. I needed every possible thing in my favor. Yes, I still hoped for a job, even after two years. I still meant to keep on plugging, making the rounds. I'd go out again today. The timer clicked and my egg was ready. I swallowed the tablets and then took the egg to the table to savor it and make it last. As I leaned forward to sit, the metal tag dangled from my neck, catching the glowlight. My identity tag. Everything came back in a rush— My name. The dream and her voice. And her suggestion. Would I dare? Would I start out this very morning and take the risk, the terrible risk?"}

{"chunk_id": "I,_the_Unspeakable_2#0", "contents": "You remember renumbering. Two years ago. You remember how it was then; how everybody looked forward to his new designation, and how everybody made jokes about the way the letters came out, and how all the records were for a while fouled up beyond recognition. The telecomics kidded renumbering. One went a little too far and they psycho-scanned him and then sent him to Marscol as a dangerous nonconform. If you were disappointed with your new designation, you didn't complain. You didn't want a sudden visit from the Deacons during the night. There had to be renumbering. We all understood that. With the population of Northem already past two billion, the old designations were too clumsy. Renumbering was efficient. It contributed to the good of Northem. It helped advance the warless struggle with Southem. The equator is the boundary. I understand that once there was a political difference and that the two superstates sprawled longitudinally, not latitudinally, over the globe. Now they are pretty much the same. There is the truce, and they are both geared for war. They are both efficient states, as tightly controlled as an experiment with enzymes, as microsurgery, as the temper of a diplomat. We were renumbered, then, in Northem. You know the system: everybody now has six digits and an additional prefix or suffix of four letters. Stateleader, for instance, has the designation AAAA-111/111. Now, to address somebody by calling off four letters is a little clumsy. We try to pronounce them when they are pronounceable. That is, no one says to Stateleader, \"Good morning, A-A-A-A.\" They say, \"Good morning, Aaaa.\" Reading the last quote, I notice a curious effect. It says what I feel. Of course I didn't feel that way on that particular morning. I was still conformal; the last thing in my mind was that I would infract and be psycho-scanned. Four letters then, and in many cases a pronounceable four letter word. A four letter word. Yes, you suspect already. You know what a four letter word can be. Mine was. It was unspeakable. The slight weight on my forehead reminded me that I still wore my sleep-learner. I'd been studying administrative cybernetics, hoping to qualify in that field, although it was a poor substitute for a space drive expert. I removed the band and stepped across the room and turned off the oscillator. I went back to my egg and my bitter memories. I will never forget the first day I received my new four letter combination and reported it to my chief, as required. I was unthinkably embarrassed. He didn't say anything. He just swallowed and choked and became crimson when he saw it. He didn't dare pass it to his secretarial engineer; he went to the administrative circuits and registered it himself. I can't blame him for easing me out. He was trying to run an efficient organization, after all, and no doubt I upset its efficiency.

Whenever anyone, especially a woman, asked my name, the embarrassment would become a crackling electric field all about us. The best tactic was just not to answer."}

He looked haggard. \"Er—old man,\" he said, not quite able to bring himself to utter my name, \"I'm going to have to switch you to another department. How would you like to work on nutrition kits? Very interesting work.\" \"Nutrition kits? Me? On nutrition kits?\" \"Well, I—er—know it sounds unusual, but it justifies. I just had the cybs work it over in the light of present regulations, and it justifies.\" Everything had to justify, of course. Every act in the monthly report had to be covered by regulations and cross-regulations. Of course there were so many regulations that if you just took the time to work it out, you could justify damn near anything. I knew what the chief was up to. Just to remove me from my post would have taken a year of applications and hearings and innumerable visits to the capital in Center One. But if I should infract—deliberately infract—it would enable the chief to let me go. The equivalent of resigning. \"I'll infract,\" I said. \"Rather than go on nutrition kits, I'll infract.\" He looked vastly relieved. \"Uh—fine,\" he said. \"I rather hoped you would.\" It took a week or so. Then I was on Non-Productive status and issued an N/P book for my necessities. Very few luxury coupons in the N/P book. I didn't really mind at first. My new living machine was smaller, but basically comfortable, and since I was still a loyal member of the state and a verified conformist, I wouldn't starve. But I didn't know what I was in for. I went from bureau to bureau, office to office, department to department—any place where they might use a space drive expert. A pattern began to emerge; the same story everywhere. When I mentioned my specialty they would look delighted. When I handed them my tag and they saw my name, they would go into immediate polite confusion. As soon as they recovered they would say they'd call me if anything turned up...."}
{"chunk_id": "I,_the_Unspeakable_4#0", "contents": "A few weeks of this and I became a bit dazed. And then there was the problem of everyday existence. You might say it's lucky to be an N/P for a while. I've heard people say that. Basic needs provided, worlds of leisure time; on the surface it sounds attractive. But let me give you an example. Say it is monthly realfood day. You go to the store, your mouth already watering in anticipation. You take your place in line and wait for your package. The distributor takes your coupon book and is all ready to reach for your package—and then he sees the fatal letters N/P. Non-Producer. A drone, a drain upon the State. You can see his stare curdle. He scowls at the book again. \"Not sure this is in order. Better go to the end of the line. We'll check it later.\" You know what happens before the end of the line reaches the counter. No more packages. Well, I couldn't get myself off N/P status until I got a post, and with my name I couldn't get a post. Nor could I change my name. You know what happens when you try to change something already on the records. The very idea of wanting change implies criticism of the State. Unthinkable behavior. That was why this curious dream voice shocked me so. The thing that it suggested was quite as embarrassing as its non-standard, emotional, provocative tone. Bear with me; I'm getting to the voice—to her —in a moment. I want to tell you first about the loneliness, the terrible loneliness. I could hardly join group games at any of the rec centers. I could join no special interest clubs or even State Loyalty chapters. Although I dabbled with theoretical research in my own quarters, I could scarcely submit any findings for publication—not with my name attached. A pseudonym would have been non-regulation and illegal. But there was the worst thing of all. I could not mate."}
{"chunk_id": "I,_the_Unspeakable_5#0", "contents": "Funny, I hadn't thought about mating until it became impossible. I remember the first time, out of sheer idleness, I wandered into a Eugenic Center. I filled out my form very carefully and submitted it for analysis and assignment. The clerk saw my name, and did the usual double-take. He coughed and swallowed and fidgeted. He said, \"Of course you understand that we must submit your application to the woman authorized to spend time in the mating booths with you, and that she has the right to refuse.\" \"Yes, I understand that.\" \"M'm,\" he said, and dismissed me with a nod. I waited for a call in the next few weeks, still hoping, but I knew no woman would consent to meet a man with my name, let alone enter a mating booth with him. The urge to reproduce myself became unbearable. I concocted all sorts of wild schemes. I might infract socially and be classified a nonconform and sent to Marscol. I'd heard rumors that in that desolate land, on that desolate planet, both mingling and mating were rather disgustingly unrestricted. Casual mating would be terribly dangerous, of course, with all the wild irradiated genes from the atomic decade still around, but I felt I'd be willing to risk that. Well, almost.... About then I began to have these dreams. As I've told you, in the dream there was only this woman's seductive voice. The first time I heard it I awoke in a warm sweat and swore something had gone wrong with the sleep-learner. You never hear the actual words with this machine, of course; you simply absorb the concepts unconsciously. Still, it seemed an explanation. I checked thoroughly. Nothing wrong. The next night I heard the woman's voice again. \" Try it ,\" she said. \" Do it. Start tomorrow to get your name changed. There will be a way. There must be a way. The rules are so mixed up that a clever man can do almost anything. Do it, please—for me. \""}

I awoke that time and half-expected a Deacon to pop out of the tube and turn his electric club upon me. And I heard the voice nearly every night. It hammered away. \" What if you do fail? Almost anything would be better than the miserable existence you're leading now! \" One morning I even caught myself wondering just how I'd go about this idea of hers. Wondering what the first step might be. She seemed to read my thoughts. That night she said, \" Consult the cybs in the Govpub office. If you look hard enough and long enough, you'll find a way. \" Now, on this morning of the seventeenth day in the ninth month, I ate my boiled egg slowly and actually toyed with the idea. I thought of being on productive status again. I had almost lost my fanatical craving to be useful to the State, but I did want to be busy—desperately. I didn't want to be despised any more. I didn't want to be lonely. I wanted to reproduce myself. I made my decision suddenly. Waves of emotion carried me along. I got up, crossed the room to the directory, and pushbuttoned to find the location of the nearest Govpub office. I didn't know what would happen and almost didn't care. II Like most important places, the Govpub Office in Center Four was underground. I could have taken a tunnelcar more quickly, but it seemed pleasanter to travel topside. Or maybe I just wanted to put this off a bit. Think about it. Compose myself. At the entrance to the Govpub warren there was a big director cyb, a plate with a speaker and switch. The sign on it said to switch it on and get close to the speaker and I did. The cyb's mechanical voice—they never seem to get the \"th\" sounds right—said, \"This is Branch Four of the Office of Government Publications. Say, 'Publications,' and/or, 'Information desired,' as thoroughly and concisely as possible. Use approved voice and standard phraseology.\" Well, simple enough so far. I had always rather prided myself on my knack for approved voice, those flat, emotionless tones that indicate efficiency. And I would never forget how to speak Statese. I said, \"Applicant desires all pertinent information relative assignment, change or amendment of State Serial designations, otherwise generally referred to as nomenclature.\" There was a second's delay while the audio patterns tripped relays and brought the memory tubes in. Then the cyb said, \"Proceed to Numbering and Identity section. Consult alphabetical list and diagram on your left for location of same.\" \"Thanks,\" I said absent-mindedly. I started to turn away and the cyb said, \"Information on tanks is military information and classified. State authorization for—\" I switched it off."}

I took the shaft to the proper level and then it was only a walk of a few hundred yards through the glowlit corridors. N. & I. turned out to be a big room, somewhat circular, very high-ceilinged, with banks of cyb controls covering the upper walls. Narrow passageways, like spokes, led off in several directions. There was an information desk in the center of the room. I looked that way and my heart went into free fall. There was a girl at the information desk. An exceptionally attractive girl. She was well within the limits of acceptable standard, and her features were even enough, and her hair a middle blonde—but she had something else. Hard to describe. It was a warmth, a buoyancy, a sense of life and intense animation. It didn't exactly show; it radiated. It seemed to sing out from her clear complexion, from her figure, which even a tunic could not hide, from everything about her. And if I were to state my business, I would have to tell her my name. I almost backed out right then. I stopped momentarily. And then common sense took hold and I realized that if I were to go through with this thing, here would be only the first of a long series of embarrassments and discomforts. It had to be done. I walked up to the desk and the girl turned to face me, and I could have sworn that a faint smile crossed her lips. It was swift, like the shadow of a bird across one of the lawns in one of the great parks topside. Very non-standard. Yet I wasn't offended; if anything, I felt suddenly and disturbingly pleased. \"What information is desired?\" she asked. Her voice was standard—or was it? Again I had the feeling of restrained warmth. I used colloquial. \"I want to get the dope on State Serial designations, how they're assigned and so forth. Especially how they might be changed.\" She put a handsteno on the desk top and said, \"Name? Address? Post?\" I froze. I stood there and stared at her. She looked up and said, \"Well?\" \"I—er—no post at present. N/P status.\" Her fingers moved on the steno. I gave her my address and she recorded that. Then I paused again. She said, \"And your name?\" I took a deep breath and told her. I didn't want to look into her eyes. I wanted to look away, but I couldn't find a decent excuse to. I saw her eyes become wide and noticed for the first time that they were a warm gray, almost a mouse color. I felt like laughing at that irrelevant observation, but more than that I felt like turning and running.

A typer clicked away. She tore off a slip of paper, consulted it, and said, \"Information desired is in Bank 29. Please follow me.\" Well, following her was a pleasure, anyway. I could watch the movement of her hips and torso as she walked. She was not tall, but long-legged and extremely lithe. Graceful and rhythmic. Very, very feminine, almost beyond standard in that respect. I felt blood throb in my temples and was heartily ashamed of myself. I would like to be in a mating booth with her, I thought, the full authorized twenty minutes. And I knew I was unconformist and the realization hardly scared me at all. She led me down one of the long passageways. A few moments later I said, \"Don't you sometimes get—well, pretty lonely working here?\" Personal talk at a time like this wasn't approved behavior, but I couldn't help it. She answered hesitantly, but at least she answered. She said, \"Not terribly. The cybs are company enough most of the time.\" \"You don't get many visitors, then.\" \"Not right here. N. & I. isn't a very popular section. Most people who come to Govpub spend their time researching in the ancient manuscript room. The—er—social habits of the pre-atomic civilization.\" I laughed. I knew what she meant, all right. Pre-atomics and their ideas about free mating always fascinated people. I moved up beside her. \"What's your name, by the way?\" \"L-A-R-A 339/827.\" I pronounced it. \"Lara. Lah-rah. That's beautiful. Fits you, too.\""}

I had a sudden impulse to ask her to meet me after hours at one of the rec centers. If it had been my danger alone, I might have, but I couldn't very well ask her to risk discovery of a haphazard, unauthorized arrangement like that and the possibility of going to the psycho-scan. We came to a turn in the corridor and something happened; I'm not sure just how it happened. I keep telling myself that my movements were not actually deliberate. I was to the right of her. The turn was to the left. She turned quickly, and I didn't, so that I bumped into her, knocking her off balance. I grabbed her to keep her from falling. For a moment we stood there, face to face, touching each other lightly. I held her by the arms. I felt the primitive warmth of her breath. Our eyes held together ... proton ... electron ... I felt her tremble. She broke from my grip suddenly and started off again. After that she was very business-like. We came finally to the controls of Bank 29 and she stood before them and began to press button combinations. I watched her work; I watched her move. I had almost forgotten why I'd come here. The lights blinked on and off and the typers clacked softly as the machine sorted out information. She had a long printed sheet from the roll presently. She frowned at it and turned to me. \"You can take this along and study it,\" she said, \"but I'm afraid what you have in mind may be—a little difficult.\" She must have guessed what I had in mind. I said, \"I didn't think it would be easy.\" \"It seems that the only agency authorized to change a State Serial under any circumstances is Opsych.\" \"Opsych?\" You can't keep up with all these departments. \"The Office of Psychological Adjustment. They can change you if you go from a lower to higher E.A.C.\" \"I don't get it, exactly.\" As she spoke I had the idea that there was sympathy in her voice. Just an overtone. \"Well,\" she said, \"as you know, the post a person is qualified to hold often depends largely on his Emotional Adjustment Category. Now if he improves and passes from, let us say, Grade 3 to Grade 4, he will probably change his place of work. In order to protect him from any associative maladjustments developed under the old E.A.C, he is permitted a new number.\" I groaned. \"But I'm already in the highest E.A.C.!\" \"It looks very uncertain then.\" \"Sometimes I think I'd be better off in the mines, or on Marscol—or—in the hell of the pre-atomics!\" She looked amused. \"What did you say your E.A.C. was?\" \"Oh, all right. Sorry.\" I controlled myself and grinned. \"I guess this whole thing has been just a little too much for me. Maybe my E.A.C.'s even gone down.\" \"That might be"}

Center One, the capital, for a guess. You'll have to get a travel permit to go there, of course. Just a moment.\" She worked at the machine again, trying it on general data. The printed slip came out a moment later and she read it to me. Chief, Opsych, was in the capital all right. It didn't give the exact location of his office, but it did tell how to find the underground bay in Center One containing the Opsych offices. We headed back through the passageway then and she kept well ahead of me. I couldn't keep my eyes from her walk, from the way she walked with everything below her shoulders. My blood was pounding at my temples again. I tried to keep the conversation going. \"Do you think it'll be hard to get a travel permit?\" \"Not impossible. My guess is that you'll be at Travbur all day tomorrow, maybe even the next day. But you ought to be able to swing it if you hold out long enough.\" I sighed. \"I know. It's that way everywhere in Northem. Our motto ought to be, 'Why make it difficult when with just a little more effort you can make it impossible?'\""}
{"chunk_id": "I,_the_Unspeakable_10#0", "contents": "She started to laugh, and then, as she emerged from the passageway into the big circular room, she cut her laugh short. A second later, as I came along, I saw why. There were two Deacons by the central desk. They were burly and had that hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric clubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides. I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not. I know they kept looking at me. Lara and I crossed the room silently, she back to her desk, I to the exit door. The Deacons' remote, disapproving eyes swung in azimuth, tracking us. I walked out and wanted to turn and smile at Lara, and get into my smile something of the hope that someday, somewhere, I'd see her again—but of course I didn't dare. III I had the usual difficulties at Travbur the next day. I won't go into them, except to say that I was batted from office to office like a ping pong ball, and that, when I finally got my travel permit, I was made to feel that I had stolen an original Picasso from the State Museum. I made it in a day. Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing time. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the following morning. In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at theoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping around. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and got up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a drama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to the forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem political prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of Mars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led by our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker than water. Standard. There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless forests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in a green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up with the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet. And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for the nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere in the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere beyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go there.... Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a verse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had unwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.)

The poem went: Wherever I go, I go too, And spoil everything. That was it. The story of mankind. I turned the glowlight down and lay on the pneumo after a while, but I didn't sleep for a long, long time. Then, when I did sleep, when I had been sleeping, I heard the voice again. The low, seductive woman's voice—the startling, shocking voice out of my unconscious. \" You have taken the first step ,\" she said. \" You are on your way to freedom. Don't stop now. Don't sink back into the lifelessness of conformity. Go on ... on and on. Keep struggling, for that is the only answer.... \""}

I was in my thirties, at the mid-point of my life, and the whole of that life had been spent under the State. I knew no other way to act. Suppressing what little individuality I might have was, for me, a way of survival. I was chockful of prescribed, stereotyped reactions, and I held onto them even when something within me told me what they were. This wasn't easy, this breaking away, not even this slight departure from the secure, camouflaged norm.... \" The woman, Lara, attracts you ,\" said the voice. I suppose at that point I twitched or rolled in my sleep. Yes, the voice was right, the woman Lara attracted me. So much that I ached with it. \" Take her. Find a way. When you succeed in changing your name, and know that you can do things, then find a way. There will be a way. \" The idea at once thrilled and frightened me. I woke writhing and in a sweat again. It was morning. I dressed and headed for the jetcopter stage and the ship for Center One. The ship was comfortable and departed on time, a transport with seats for about twenty passengers. I sat near the tail and moodily busied myself watching the gaunt brown earth far below. Between Centers there was mostly desert, only occasional patches of green. Before the atomic decade, I had heard, nearly all the earth was green and teemed with life ... birds, insects, animals, people, too. It was hard rock and sand now, with a few scrubs hanging on for life. The pre-atomics, who hadn't mastered synthesization, would have a hard time scratching existence from the earth today. I tried to break the sad mood, and started to look around at some of the other passengers. That was when I first noticed the prisoners in the forward seats. Man and woman, they were, a youngish, rather non-descript couple, thin, very quiet. They were manacled and two Deacons sat across from them. The Deacons' backs were turned to me and I could see the prisoners' faces. They had curious faces. Their eyes were indescribably sad, and yet their lips seemed to be ready to smile at any moment. They were holding hands, not seeming to care about this vulgar emotional display. I had the sudden crazy idea that Lara and I were sitting there, holding hands like that, nonconforming in the highest, and that we were wonderfully happy. Our eyes were sad too, but we were really happy, quietly happy, and that was why our lips stayed upon the brink of a smile."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] No doubt whatever about it, I had the Indian sign on me ... my comfortably untidy world had suddenly turned into a monstrosity of order! When I got home from the office, I was not so much tired as beaten down, but the effect is similar. I let myself into the apartment, which had an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown temperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but according to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got dressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my wife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone. What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumed the carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! The ashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the place looked wife-deserted. It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'd had to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I write for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in. \"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said. \"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go on grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac. You'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\" If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over my hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held me up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform, just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one which exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing happened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain had stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington."}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_2#0", "contents": "As I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where they were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the usual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular, a man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay. While I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was able to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size of an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight, and then his chattering drill hit it. There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on his back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the moment of the explosion—if so feeble a thing can be called one—I felt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my hand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the bleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some pink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I found that I had missed the story conference. During the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase \"I'm just spitballing\" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite, \"The whole ball of wax,\" twelve times. However, my story had been accepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the conference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World, the Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which rung of the ladder you have achieved. The subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the apartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing there talking to the doorman. He said, \"Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it at your office building.\" I looked blank and he explained, \"We just heard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed at the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it.\" Anything can happen in advertising, I thought. \"That's right, Danny, I just missed it,\" I said, and went on in. Psychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the other hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and except for the alarm clock, I'd had no control over what had been going on. I went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the directions Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until she got back from her mother's in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days. How to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and such. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced that I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the reasons she supposes. I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice:"}

She is right, but not for the reasons she supposes. I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: \"When you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door, too.\" Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in front of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate me from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil. When I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the manuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The pencil was standing on its end."}

I turned back to my novel and drank some of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the muggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last sentence. Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising. My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: \"Garbage picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I love you.\" What can you do when the girl loves you? I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was exercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be allowed to perch, but were not allowed to. Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that their wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking about this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn, they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all wanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and fell. The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and picked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side, stroking its feathers. My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were interrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is usually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like an incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that of my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has never, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late afternoon. \"You can't say a thing like that to me!\" I heard him shout. \"I tell you I got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started to play!\" Several other loud voices started at the same time. \"Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!\" \"Yeah, and only when you were dealer!\" The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the door to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting him, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the impulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he looked stunned. \"Here!\" he said, holding out a deck of cards, \"For Pete's sake, look at 'em yourselves if you think they're marked!\" The nearest man struck them up from his hand. \"Okay,"}

So they're not marked! All I know is five straight....\" His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards on the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the rest face up—all red."}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_4#0", "contents": "Someone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and the four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence, got in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly arranged cards. \"Judas!\" he said, and started to pick them up. \"Will you look at that! My God, what a session....\" I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it, but I had an idea what I would hear. After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed. \"Never seen anything to equal it,\" he said. \"Wouldn't have believed it. Those guys didn't believe it. Every round normal, nothing unusual about the hands—three of a kind, a low straight, that sort of thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be my deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king—every time! And each time, somebody else has four aces....\" He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There was one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top broke and glass chips got into the bottle. \"I'll have to go down for more soda,\" I said. \"I'll come, too. I need air.\" At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in what must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the top of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the tile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from at least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and I was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth open and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his mouth open. On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie his shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi swerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded, its rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign cars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any side-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to rest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that moment. The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and the taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged crosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either forward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi to a lamp. Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at all, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues. Everyone was honking his horn.

{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_5#0", "contents": "Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had brightened up considerably. \"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said. \"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned and nodded toward the pandemonium. When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except one. That was tied in three knots. All right , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he knows everything. When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought, more trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's voice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were connected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\" \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for you to work on.\" \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—\" \"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\" \"At once,\" he said, and hung up. While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of my novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a point where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter \"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to the side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red. This was absolutely not my day."}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_6#0", "contents": "\"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you've told me is impossible or supernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against that poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him. It's all those other things....\" He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight while I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern. \"Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at what I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely, and the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that you're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.\" I started to get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don't you see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook his head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a demonstration.\" He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any change on you?\" \"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There must have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think they'll each have the same date, perhaps?\" \"Did you accumulate all that change today?\" \"No. During the week.\" He shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that would be actually impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if they all come up heads.\" I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the floor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked themselves into a neat pile. I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them. These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching. \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\" \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the Universe—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of Thermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast; it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental manifestation.\" \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is controlling the coins and—the other things?\""}

When I see a natural law being broken, I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the book of rules. Something—I don't know what—is going on, and it seems to involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you still in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?\" \"I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left.\" \"Hm. You're the center, all right. But why?\" \"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an electrical storm. Something has it in for me!\" McGill grinned. \"Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be anthropomorphic.\" \"Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life.\" \"On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are being rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it's a non-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder.\" He had a faraway, frowning look. I was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off. \"Let's go out and eat,\" I said, \"There's not a damn thing in the kitchen and I'm not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee.\" We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we could hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were, by this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we heard one of them say to Danny, \"I don't know what the hell's going on around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it. They can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen anything like it.\" Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they tried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let the other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had embarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were replaced by looks of suspicion and then determination. \"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead, only to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches which met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts ever witnessed—a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything else, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical excuses and threats."}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_8#0", "contents": "Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right, Mr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don't know what's going on around here, but ever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\" he shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over here!\" Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas intertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over fenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the ladies seemed not to be. \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my umbrella and we'll say no more about it!\" \"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary. The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also caught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the other two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go, but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was Molly. My nurse-wife. \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all right?\" Was I all right! \"Molly! What are you doing here?\" \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to think.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\" \"Of course I'm all right. But why....\" \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's number and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced and it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a busy signal. Oh, dear, are you sure you're all right?\" I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look. Then I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast to it. \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said. When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said. \"And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.\" He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was a jump ahead of him. \"In other words, you think it's something organic?\" \"Well,\" McGill said, \"I'm trying to think of anything else it might be. I'm not doing so well,\" he confessed. \"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it's mere probability, and without any over-all pattern.\" \"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\""}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_9#0", "contents": "Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you feel all right, darling?\" she asked me. I nodded brightly. \"You'll think this silly of me,\" she went on to McGill, \"but why isn't it something like an overactive poltergeist?\" \"Pure concept,\" he said. \"No genuine evidence.\" \"Magnetism?\" \"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't magnetic—and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy, and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field, all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than that—they go on moving.\" \"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\" \"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree this—thing—has no discernible shape and motion is involved, but plants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a non-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing—at least in what you might call improbability.\" Molly frowned. \"Then what is it? What's it made of?\" \"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about the atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to be forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck of sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of crystallization.\" \"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an impertinent look. \"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn't have the same date? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\" \"Because I don't think this thing got going before today and everything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions here and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would require retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book. That telephone now—\" The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone repairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen. \"I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister,\" he said with strong disapproval. \"Certainly not,\" I said. \"Is it broken?\" \"Not exactly broken , but—\" He shook his head and took it apart some more."}

{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_10#0", "contents": "McGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried to explain to me what had happened with the phone. \"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the receiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open.\" \"But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay.\" \"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the floor—something like that—just happened to cause the right induction impulses. Yes, I know how you feel,\" he said, seeing my expression. \"It's beginning to bear down.\" Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was so pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry. \"I'm in no mood to cook,\" she said. \"Let's get away from all this.\" McGill raised an eyebrow. \"If all this, as you call it, will let us.\" In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way. \"I've been put on the story—who could be better?—I live here. So far, I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny, but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?\" \"He's got a theory,\" said Molly. \"Come and eat with us and he'll tell you all about it.\" Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant, and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me. \"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it's at the station house. What there's left of it, that is.\" Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt the speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of cigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I happened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before I could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the sidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but said nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter. When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool—although it didn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door and ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the next table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green evening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter returned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold cuts for the man,"}

It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used instead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and made faces."}
{"chunk_id": "I_am_a_Nucleus_11#0", "contents": "The waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to the bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted one of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled expression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a row of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour. That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing came out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again. Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his pick, his face pink with exasperation. I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice is a crystal, I thought to myself. The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar crowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back, baffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the kitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls, which he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had grown larger. Molly lit a cigarette and said, \"I suppose this is all part of it, Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here.\" It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter—a background noise had stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of the air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made a gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her cigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring vichyssoise. \"Hey! What's the idea?\" snarled the sour-looking man. \"I'm terribly sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident. I—\" \"Throwing cigarettes at people!\" the fat lady said. \"I really didn't mean to,\" I began again, getting up. There must have been a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff buttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely set tables, I pulled everything—tablecloth, silver, water glasses, ashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine—onto the floor. The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The owner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us with a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I was outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\" \"On my way, sir!\" At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already throwing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one chance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The throbbing rumble changed tone. Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact. \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\" \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\" O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before blast-off?\" \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have registered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?\" \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\" \"I don't know yet, sir.\" \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\" The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all aboard gone in a churning cloud. Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed and a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner Chief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch room. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it. By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably inquired what was in charge of Burner Four. Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt that way. She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman either. Oh,"}

And his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt that way. She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which O'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am! \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I couldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door. So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there, naturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned resetting the control.\""}
{"chunk_id": "IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_2#0", "contents": "O'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her until she couldn't sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a breath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why O'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all that bother to get out here!\" \"You're so kind. But I'm afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in there.\" \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I'll drop a suggestion in the Old Woman's box first chance I get.\" \"You're so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\" \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\" \"You're so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence that O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for her. Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover when he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who had a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money. A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel. When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well, what about that control?\" \"What control?\" \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\" \"Oh, that little thing.\" Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again? Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\" \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing gracefully. \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\" O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that Burner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's, would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now. Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary. Oh, very quite! \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks she'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway about your fusion control!\" \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have been thinking.\" \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower door. \"Venus dames,\" O'Rielly said dreamily, \"don't boss anything, do"}

You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\" Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O'Rielly, open your big ears whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters. \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or family—everything. \"Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats with knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on Earth again there wouldn't be enough left of Venus to find with an electron microscope."}
{"chunk_id": "IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_3#0", "contents": "\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny notions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an atom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys. Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a deal. \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything at bargain basement prices.\" \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O'Rielly said, still dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\" \"Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten foot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn't make a whit difference—you'd still act sappier than thirty-seven angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. \"Holy hollering saints!\" \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded with an airy laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and lived to tell it, has he?\" \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\" \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O'Rielly snorted. \"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\" \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about. \"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough to stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags, even through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tells whether there's any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig's pile of 'em. \"Didn't pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation. Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving. Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\" With suddenly enlivened interest O'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how come you know so much?\" \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more, you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high on vino and"}

Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high on vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we feed the Old Woman?\" \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully. \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for! Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at least!\" Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee. Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway was saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her lovely neck and his own forever. O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not opened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone! At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old head. \"Berta!\" \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's name is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and twenty-five years ago.\""}
{"chunk_id": "IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_4#0", "contents": "\"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and was being slapped together again. \"O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced pirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up, you don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we don't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into O'Rielly's shower. O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite Trillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap and coverall uniform of a baggage boy. \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\" Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\" Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this ship. O'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don't you worry about another thing!\" \"Oh, I'm not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the way Grandmamma knew it would!\" O'Rielly's shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko, bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No, don't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\" \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted to know. The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure. Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she looked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk. Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\" Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman. She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked you a question, did I not?\" \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the answer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was discussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly here is considering it, ma'am.\" Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more ideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life. Yes, ma'am! \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to freeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\" \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\" Callahan assured"}
{"chunk_id": "IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_4#1", "contents": "it, ma'am.\" Wasn't too bad a fib.

Naturally I offered this innocent young Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't bother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world! Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a courtly bow. \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face, then in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\" she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for? Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join me, Your Excellency?\" \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female ever told any Venus man what to do. The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly blowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with sweat. Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You first, Your Excellency.\" \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger, \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\" No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old Woman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more satisfactory.\" \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\""}

Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from busting out laughing for joy. Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And betwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd be happy forever. A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and yanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk. \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of course. \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\" \"Trillium,\" O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to keep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?\" Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladly drowned himself if he could. \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and for her leaving her planet.\" \"Shut up!\" His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight out sideways. \"I'll handle this!\" \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\" \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President of Venus and this thing can mean war!\" \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at O'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\" O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness and protect it to his last breath of life. Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk. Panels on opposite walls lit up. \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly. \"Interplanetary emergency.\" Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally pleasant. \"Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\" \"Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious war efforts.\" Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship. Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\" The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices. Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\" The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features, that were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his Excellency, \"what's this nonsense?\" \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with annoyance. \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore. \"Some silly female cackling now!\" The parties in the panels saw each other now.

Never did catch the devil.... Berta? Impossible!\" Madame President's shapely finger now rested full on the button that could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a thousand years. \"I'm afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter's actions have every mark of an invasion tactic by your government.\" \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President's finger now lay poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under your official command! Weren't you, Trillium dear?\" \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring our cause to the attention of Earth's President. If Earth will only stop buying from Venus, you won't have any money to squander on your wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\" \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what's wrong with my wars? People have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\" \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they haven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatal attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home doing useful work!\" \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\" \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and be lonely!\" \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That's the way things have been on Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can't change it!\" \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\" \"What?\" Grandpapa's beards near pulled his ears off. \"It's not legal! You can't get away with this!\" \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to Trillium's advised from the Venus panel. Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta!

Guards!\" \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you're in the cooler, enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques.

Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\" \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we Venus women had our own men in our power.\" \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth's tranquility.\" Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden. Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest headache in history. \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame President of Venus, congratulations on your victory! \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest convenience.\" \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take over Dimmy's credentials.\" \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\" \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that Mr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our revolution better than they knew.\" \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs best.\" The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan. Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure before returning to your stations.\" \"Oh, well,\" O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\" \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of Saturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the crows for breakfast.\" Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary. \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O'Rielly said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why did Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?\" \"Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled, like to himself, \"they'd of found out the"}

LAFFERTY [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there be life traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. So they skipped several steps in the procedure. The chordata discerner read Positive over most of the surface. There was spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omitted several tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thought on the body? Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; it required a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they found nothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Then it came—clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only. \"Limited,\" said Steiner, \"as though within a pale. As though there were but one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of the surface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hours before it's back in our ken if we let it go now.\" \"Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest of the world to make sure we've missed nothing,\" said Stark. There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult of analysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This was designed simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this might be so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and the designer of it were puzzled as to how to read the results. The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locator had refused to read Positive when turned on the inventor himself, bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he had extraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. He told the machine so heatedly. The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, that Glaser did not have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinary perception to an extraordinary degree. There is a difference , the machine insisted. It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but built others more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the owners of Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply. And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (or Eppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read Positive on a number of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could not even read music. But it had also read Positive on ninety per cent of the acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a sound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered.

But it had also read Positive on ninety per cent of the acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a sound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Mi it had read Positive on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out of billions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at all was shown by the test. So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the area and got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently one individual, though this could not be certain) and got very definite action. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, and assumed an air of importance when it ran these tests. Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it ever produces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrug of the shoulders in a man. They called it the \"You tell me light.\" So among the intelligences there was at least one that might be extraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to be forewarned."}
{"chunk_id": "IN_THE_GARDEN_2#0", "contents": "\"Scan the remainder of the world, Steiner,\" said Stark, \"and the rest of us will get some sleep. If you find no other spot then we will go down on that one the next time it is in position under us, in about twelve hours.\" \"You don't want to visit any of the other areas first? Somewhere away from the thoughtful creature?\" \"No. The rest of the world may be dangerous. There must be a reason that thought is in one spot only. If we find no others then we will go down boldly and visit this.\" So they all, except Steiner, went off to their bunks then: Stark, the Captain; Gregory Gilbert, the executive officer; Wolfgang Langweilig, the engineer; Casper Craig, super-cargo, tycoon and 51% owner of the Little Probe, and F. R. Briton, S.J., a Jesuit priest who was linguist and checker champion of the craft. Dawn did not come to the moon-town. The Little Probe hovered stationary in the light and the moon-town came up under the dawn. Then the Probe went down to visit whatever was there. \"There's no town,\" said Steiner. \"Not a building. Yet we're on the track of the minds. There's nothing but a meadow and some boscage, a sort of fountain or pool, and four streams coming out of it.\" \"Keep on towards the minds,\" said Stark. \"They're our target.\" \"Not a building, not two sticks or stones placed together. That looks like an Earth-type sheep there. And that looks like an Earth-lion, I'm almost afraid to say. And those two ... why, they could well be Earth-people. But with a difference. Where is that bright light coming from?\" \"I don't know, but they're right in the middle of it. Land here. We'll go to meet them at once. Timidity has never been an efficacious tool with us.\" Well, they were people. And one could only wish that all people were like them. There was a man and a woman, and they were clothed either in very bright garments or in no garments at all, but only in a very bright light. \"Talk to them, Father Briton,\" said Stark. \"You are the linguist.\" \"Howdy,\" said the priest. He may or may not have been understood, but the two of them smiled at him, so he went on. \"Father Briton from Philadelphia,\" he said, \"on detached service. And you, my good man, what is your handle, your monicker, your tag?\" \"Ha-Adamah,\" said the man. \"And your daughter, or niece?\" It may be that the shining man frowned momentarily at this; but the woman smiled, proving that she was human. \"The woman is named Hawwah,\" said the man. \"The sheep is named sheep, the lion is named lion, the horse is named horse and the hoolock is named hoolock.\" \"I understand. It is possible that this could go on and on.

It was water, but water that excelled, cool and with all its original bubbles like the first water ever made. \"What do you make of them?\" asked Stark. \"Human,\" said Steiner. \"It may even be that they are a little more than human. I don't understand that light that surrounds them. And they seem to be clothed, as it were, in dignity.\" \"And very little else,\" said Father Briton, \"though that light trick does serve a purpose. But I'm not sure they'd pass in Philadelphia.\" \"Talk to them again,\" said Stark. \"You're the linguist.\" \"That isn't necessary here, Captain. Talk to them yourself.\" \"Are there any other people here?\" Stark asked the man. \"The two of us. Man and woman.\" \"But are there any others?\" \"How would there be any others? What other kind of people could there be than man and woman?\" \"But is there more than one man or woman?\" \"How could there be more than one of anything?\" The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly: \"Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?\" \"You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and then you can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is named Engineer. He is named Flunky.\" \"Thanks a lot,\" said Steiner. \"But are we not people?\" persisted Captain Stark. \"No. We are the people. There are no people but two. How could there be other people?\" \"And the damnest thing about it,\" muttered Langweilig, \"is, how are you going to prove him wrong? But it does give you a small feeling.\" \"Can we have something to eat?\" asked the Captain. \"Pick from the trees,\" said Ha-Adamah, \"and then it may be that you will want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which does not need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But you are free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.\" \"We will,\" said Captain Stark. They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were the animals. The lion and lioness were enough to make one cautious, though they offered no harm. The two bears had a puzzling look, as though they wanted either to frolic with you or to mangle you. \"If there are only two people here,\" said Casper Craig, \"then it may be that the rest of the world is not dangerous at all. It looked fertile wherever we scanned it, though not so fertile as this central bit. And those rocks would bear examining.\" \"Flecked with gold, and possibly with something else,\" said Stark. \"A very promising site.\" \"And everything grows here,\" added Steiner. \"Those are Earth-fruits and I never saw finer.

It is the finest fruit in the garden.\""}
{"chunk_id": "IN_THE_GARDEN_4#0", "contents": "\"Well, the analogy breaks down there,\" said Stark. \"I was almost beginning to believe in the thing. But if it isn't that, then what. Father Briton, you are the linguist, but in Hebrew does not Ha-Adamah and Hawwah mean—?\" \"Of course they do. You know that as well as I.\" \"I was never a believer. But would it be possible for the exact same proposition to maintain here as on Earth?\" \"All things are possible.\" And it was then that Ha-Adamah, the shining man, gave a wild cry: \"No, no. Do not approach it. It is not allowed to eat of that one!\" It was the pomegranate tree, and he was warning Langweilig away from it. \"Once more, Father,\" said Stark, \"you should be the authority; but does not the idea that it was the apple that was forbidden go back only to a medieval painting?\" \"It does. The name of the fruit is not mentioned in Genesis. In Hebrew exegesis, however, the pomegranate is usually indicated.\" \"I thought so. Question the man further, Father. This is too incredible.\" \"It is a little odd. Adam, old man, how long have you been here?\" \"Forever less six days is the answer that has been given to me. I never did understand the answer, however.\" \"And have you gotten no older in all that time?\" \"I do not understand what 'older' is. I am as I have been from the beginning.\" \"And do you think that you will ever die?\" \"To die I do not understand. I am taught that it is a property of fallen nature to die, and that does not pertain to me or mine.\" \"And are you completely happy here?\" \"Perfectly happy according to my preternatural state. But I am taught that it might be possible to lose that happiness, and then to seek it vainly through all the ages. I am taught that sickness and ageing and even death could come if this happiness were ever lost. I am taught that on at least one other unfortunate world it has actually been lost.\" \"Do you consider yourself a knowledgeable man?\" \"Yes, since I am the only man, and knowledge is natural to man. But I am further blessed. I have a preternatural intellect.\" Then Stark cut in once more: \"There must be some one question you could ask him, Father. Some way to settle it. I am becoming nearly convinced.\" \"Yes, there is a question that will settle it. Adam, old man, how about a game of checkers?\" \"This is hardly the time for clowning,\" said Stark. \"I'm not clowning, Captain. How about it, Adam? I'll give you choice of colors and first move.\" \"No. It would be no contest. I have a preternatural intellect.\" \"Well, I beat a barber who was champion of Germantown.

He has long been cranky because plans he had for us did not materialize. But we are taught that should ever evil come to us, which it cannot if we persevere, it will come by him.\" They learned no more of the real nature of the sphere in their time there. Yet all but one of them were convinced of the reality when they left. And they talked of it as they took off. \"A crowd would laugh if told of it,\" said Stark, \"but not many would laugh if they had actually seen the place, or them. I am not a gullible man, but I am convinced of this: that this is a pristine and pure world and that ours and all the others we have visited are fallen worlds. Here are the prototypes of our first parents before their fall. They are garbed in light and innocence, and they have the happiness that we have been seeking for centuries. It would be a crime if anyone disturbed that happiness.\" \"I too am convinced,\" said Steiner. \"It is Paradise itself, where the lion lies down with the lamb, and where the serpent has not prevailed.

It isn't greed or the desire for new land so much—though that is strong too. Mainly it is the feverish passion to befoul and poison what is unspoiled. Fortunately I am sagacious enough to take advantage of this trait. And when you start to farm a new world on a shoestring you have to acquire your equipment as you can.\" He looked proudly around at the great cave with its mountains and tiers of materials, heavy machinery of all sorts, titanic crates of foodstuff space-sealed; wheeled, tracked, propped, vaned and jetted vehicles; and power packs to run a world. He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at the rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner. \"We will have to have another lion,\" said Eve. \"Bowser is getting old, and Marie-Yvette abuses him and gnaws his toes. And we do have to have a big-maned lion to lie down with the lamb.\" \"I know it, Eve. The lion is a very important prop. Maybe one of the crackpot settlers will bring a new lion.\" \"And can't you mix another kind of shining paint? This itches. It's hell.\" \"I'm working on it.\""}

But that was nothing compared to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown. She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise—or had it been the chairman of the board?—back several thousand dollars. Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely on top and tight around the hips. After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important. She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\" she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just taking a bath and—Oh. It's you.\" Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date tonight.\" \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\""}

He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc., that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can just blank right out again. I saw him first!\" Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\" \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap—\" \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl, even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight, see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\" Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates, legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be like taking candy from a baby.\" Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked. \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this one night's work, there is something akilter.

Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts. What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him. \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\" \"Well—recruiting.\" The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on Mars, would they?\" \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to hire——uh, I mean engage—an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations unless we get some—a five-year contract...?\" He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself. \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the capital and get into the sticks—um, I mean the provinces. I am sure there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you can attract anyone out of Newer York.\" \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I—we need—that is.... Oh, well. Thanks. Good-by.\" He backed out of the office."}

The crowd, a rainbow of men in pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but—he used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised his government before now—in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his idea—but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an occasional trip to Swindletown— My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily, but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before Mars had such machines. If ever. The city roared at him. He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law. Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts, without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But more, he would have been among people he understood. The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to exist only in organized masses. A"}

It was hard to make out any individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand. \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The restaurant is right up those stairs.\" \"I—I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in—\" \"To your left, sir.\" The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable. \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth. \"Hm?\" said Matheny. She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games. He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead. He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off. But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him. \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\" \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously surgical bodice. \"But—I mean—when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the cocked dice?\""}

This is a church!\" \"Oh—I see—excuse me, I, I, I—\" Matheny backed out of the crowd, shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears. \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice. \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is—\" Matheny cursed his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak and curly-toed slippers. \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone Matheny had yet heard. \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I—\" He stuck out his hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\" \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\" Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\" \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\" They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what remained of his winnings. \"I don't want to—I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran—\" \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met a Martian. I am very interested.\" \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small embassy staff and an occasional like me.\" \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother planet and so on.\" \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money, at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few tourists to us?\" \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged. \"Oh,\" said Matheny."}

Doran was too pleasant a little man to deserve— \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\" \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\" \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor—a handful of people trying to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment and supplies—which can only be paid for in Earth dollars—and we can't export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\" By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down. \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic technician before?\" \"Uh, yes, but—well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\" Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices. \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\" \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean—\" \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\" Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\" \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\" \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean—well, I imagine it doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\""}
{"chunk_id": "INNOCENT_AT_LARGE_8#0", "contents": "\"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices, why do you call yourselves poor?\" \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage, and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate Earth taxes—there's very little profit going back to the distillery on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\" \"Have you not got some other business?\" \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only one has been really successful— I Was a Slave Girl on Mars . \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one. Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around—you know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars—but expressed absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\" \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big business, I have heard.\" \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked. Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\""}
{"chunk_id": "INNOCENT_AT_LARGE_9#0", "contents": "Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise, anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried to, well, attract capital from Earth?\" \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport firm or—or anybody—who wanted to come and actually invest a few dollars in Mars—why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one. But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of liberties to the incorporated state—what could General Nucleonics hope to get from Mars?\" \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\" \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation. \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\" \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\" Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins. \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\" Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the Martian. \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\" \"A pleasure.\" \"But now you must let me buy you one.\" \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with the situation as you have been describing—\" \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will entertain quite a bit.\" Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business, then?\" \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business manager for the Martian export trade.\" \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault there are so many rackets—uh, taxes—and middlemen and agencies and et cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\""}

We Martians are babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and how to dodge the tax bite and—and—well, you see how it goes, that sort of, uh, thing.\" Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second bottle of beer. \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get to see—\" \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just might. How much could you pay this fellow?\" \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's Earth years, mind you.\" \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars permanently.\" \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\" Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\" Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange some contacts.... \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\" A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a big-city taste like his. \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want—I mean what Mars really needs, get me?—is a confidence man.\" \"A what?\" \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game for us and make us some real money.\" \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\" \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit."}

I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\" \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some gaiety.\" \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room first and some more up-to-date clothes.\" \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\" The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to show the vertical incandescence of the towers. \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell—Oh.\" He tried to grin, but his face burned. \"I see.\" \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around 2100 hours earliest.\" \"What?\" \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\" \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me? Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is—\" His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened uncertain lips. \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an abandoned canal.\" \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate—\" \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does she?\" \"Well—well, no.

And maybe I have got a few contacts.\" \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom. Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him. \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if, say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you a phone number.\" He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have got to think positively.\" Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe he became overcautious. They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must. \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\" \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\" \"What? But—but—\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago. In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in. Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an instant's hesitation. \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the honest-to-zebra truth.\" \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry to—to—I mean of course I trust you, but—\" \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work. Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I was psick of Psi powers, not having any. Or didn't I? Maybe they'd psee otherwise psomeday! I walked into the dining room and collided with a floating mass of fabric, which promptly draped itself over me like a sentient shroud. \"Oh, for God's sake, Kevin!\" my middle brother's voice came muffled through the folds. \"If you can't help, at least don't hinder!\" I managed to struggle out of the tablecloth, even though it seemed to be trying to wrap itself around me. When Danny got excited, he lost his mental grip. \"I could help,\" I yelled as soon as I got my head free, \"if anybody would let me and, what's more, I could set the table a damn sight faster by hand than you do with 'kinesis.\" Just then Father appeared at the head of the table. He could as easily have walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of exhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a kid. Not that he looked his age—he was big and blond, like Danny and Tim and me, and could have passed for our older brother. \"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of yourself—picking on poor Kev.\" Even if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed. Nobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to poor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the nicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they lost their tempers could I get—or so I believed—their true attitude toward me. How else could I tell? \"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out on the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had it so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\" \"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father reminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe telepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It was so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself. \"But I think you'll find she understands.\" \"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen, \"but I'm not sure she always understands.\" I was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level, because he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either."}

I could feel them all the way upstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I must feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts, please.\" She sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her place; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass bumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over her shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere primitive, I couldn't help laughing. \"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed. Danny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you not to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of interfering busybodies getting in the way.\" \"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A robot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She turned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\" I didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the back of the chair to make my knuckles turn white. Sylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him— stop him! He's hating again! I can't stand it!\" Father looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it, Sylvia.\" I grinned. \"That's right—I'm just a poor atavism with no control over myself a-tall.\" Finally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned woman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her the complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to probe anyone without permission.\" \"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\" she said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself, Sylvia—poor Kevin isn't responsible.\" She didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted out from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable. Danny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself. Mother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress. Kevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\" A psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family—that is, not officially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more than they could help having thumbnails. \"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can adjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\" \"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father suggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at the cure-all?\" Mother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times and he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the time to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly be allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a machine in every community,"}

{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_3#0", "contents": "Now that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever got sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic. Life was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents these days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted into it—which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the population. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't, like me—psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no physical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg grafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if you could, the technique hadn't been developed yet. \"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my youngest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair. \"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I must say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\" He reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what was all that emotional uproar about?\" \"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could answer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she called. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\" \"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food floating ahead of him. \"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my sense of ominousness is connected with him.\" \"Well, that's perfectly natural—\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother caught her eye. \"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we can't figure out.\" \"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been tested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport or telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or prepossess. He can't—\" \"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to keep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my family thought of me, I knew—as an animal, and not a very lovable one, either. \"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test for. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me."}
{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_4#0", "contents": "I smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who really seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. \"It won't work, Tim. I know you're trying to be kind, but—\" \"He's not saying it just to be kind,\" my mother put in. \"He means it. Not that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin,\" she added with grim scrupulousness. \"Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his extracurricular prognostications too far.\" Nonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes. After all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he wouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather Bureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding. Mother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage me. As Danny had said, she knew but she didn't really understand . Nobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me."}
{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_5#0", "contents": "Breakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their various jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared—he was a traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the continent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take the helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a psychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist. Dan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a promotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on pianos. Only I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there were certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents would have none of them—partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of their own community standing. \"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always said. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take care of the house.\" And that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a techno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough, those things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke down, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement robots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a constructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of a career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine could be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of my family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway, they would just do it all over again when they got home. So I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to take books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and couldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was telepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even if he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got nothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can get awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a hundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound tapes, but they also bored me after a while. I thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting, which would classify me as a telesensitive—artistic ability being considered as the oldest, if least important, psi power—but I couldn't even do anything like that. About all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were out of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't want to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me and were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they were saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest Faraday boy.

Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\" I didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of attracted to me—I could see that—they could hardly go out with me without exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have done the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them."}
{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_6#0", "contents": "I wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago—before people started playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with radiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous monsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been latent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I don't know why I say we —in 1960 or so, I might have been considered superior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy. Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything useful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found a niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers geared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the time I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just barren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres drastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive had been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the stars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more. I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people couldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running around—not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior wasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent in me. Tim must be right, I thought—I must have some undreamed-of power that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was that power? For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be, explored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none productive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself. As I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably nothing more than what I seemed to be—a simple psi-negative. Yet, from time to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my knowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent psi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six? I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people liked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature. Even gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at home in those woodland—or, rather, pseudo-woodland—surroundings, able to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could with my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more sympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any household, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody noses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness as well as extrasensory imbecility. However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns than I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they broke down, for I felt no more closely akin to"}

They seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see me so calm. \"Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediate concerns, Kev?\" Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her. \"Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies?\" Tim shot back at her. \"He probably doesn't even know what's happened.\" \"Well, what did happen?\" I asked, trying not to snap. \"One starship got back from Alpha Centauri,\" Danny said excitedly. \"There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!\" This was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show my enthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keep their thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them. \"What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?\" \"Uh-uh.\" Danny shook his head. \"And hostile. The crew of the starship says they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned and left, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be a pretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrial ship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.\" \"But if they're hostile,\" I said thoughtfully, \"it might mean war.\" \"Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace, but we'll have to prepare for war just in case.\" There hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, but we hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of military techniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come back with reinforcements—if such were its intention—in less than six months. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, though we had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against the aliens' armament. They might have strange and terrible weapons against which we would be powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefits of telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepaths to pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine the outcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in the first place. Everybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. I had been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world in which I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survival to know that my own smug species could look silly against a still more talented race."}

{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_8#0", "contents": "\"It isn't so much our defense that worries me,\" my mother muttered, \"as lack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualties and there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them. It's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'll be too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave of absence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aid techniques. And you too, Kevin,\" she added, obviously a little surprised herself at what she was saying. \"Probably you'd be even better at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people's pain.\" I looked at her. \"It is an ill wind,\" she agreed, smiling wryly, \"but don't let me catch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be better that there should be no war and you should remain useless?\" I couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretched talent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powers usually included some ability to form a mental shield; being without one, I was necessarily devoid of the other. My attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. The aliens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation—even the 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought pattern was entirely different from ours—and the war was on. I had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had ever worked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powers aren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, but I was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhuman abilities—normal human abilities, rather. \"Gee, Mr. Faraday,\" one of the other students breathed, \"you're so strong. And without 'kinesis or anything.\" I looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. \"My name's not Mr. Faraday,\" I said. \"It's Kevin.\" \"My name's Lucy,\" she giggled. No girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately I started to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushed when I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding a tourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparent unconcern. \"Hey, quit that!\" the windee yelled. \"You're making it too tight! I'll be mortified!\" So Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was only a low-grade telesensitive—just a poetess—so I had nothing to worry about as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid of Sylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she got interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and she was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable a position herself.

However, when the actual bombs—or their alien equivalent—struck near our town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started carrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into a hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene—I had never seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matter of fact—and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking the way. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got his talent for prognostication. \"If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,\" she said, \" you certainly can.\" And there was no kindness at all in the you . She gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. \"Go on—now's your chance to show you're of some use in this world.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Jack_of_No_Trades_9#0", "contents": "Gritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something had pretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in the right place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother's eye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashed face again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head as if some super-psi had plucked them from me. The man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out like that before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. I wet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shaking so hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gaping wound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, not even my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought. Mother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. I could hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at my patient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound, no wound at all—just a little blood and the fellow's face was whole again. Not even a scar. \"Wha—wha happened?\" he asked. \"It doesn't hurt any more!\" He touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And I was frightened, too—too frightened to be sick, too frightened to do anything but stare witlessly at him. \"Touch some of the others, quick!\" my mother commanded, pushing astounded attendants away from stretchers. I touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and they were whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me in the way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening and shutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the whole thing was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't have imagined all those horrors. But the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find them almost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it. There was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, in seeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as it would have done under the cure-all, but in seconds. \"Timothy was right,\" my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, \"and I was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son—\" and she said the word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it—\"the greatest gift of all, that of healing.\" She looked at me proudly. And Lucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something. I felt ... well, good."}

They called it that because the touch of certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I guess.\" She nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's probably why they originally got to be the rulers.\" In a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other deficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of them turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive, and not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and effectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital just for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the world and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise the dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I wouldn't be able to do even that. When I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but Lucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm your assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly. I looked at her. \"You are?\" \"I—I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with apprehension. I gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can tell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to say. But right now—\" I clapped her arm—\"there's a job to be done.\" \"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have time to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were waiting for me. They gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough sleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to show my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit thoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those powers were useless without life, and that was what I could give. I took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know that, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently disfigured. In a sense, they were—well, my children; I felt a warm glow of affection toward them. They felt the same way toward me.

I was the most important individual on Earth, they told my followers, and my safety couldn't be risked. The human race at this stage was pretty docile. The crowds went away. And it was right that they should; I didn't want to be risked any more than they wanted to risk me. Plenty of people did come to see me officially—the President, generals, all kinds of big wheels, bringing citations, medals and other obsolete honors they'd revived primarily for me. It was wonderful. I began to love everybody. \"Don't you think you're putting too much of yourself into this, Kev?\" Lucy asked me one day. I gave her an incredulous glance. \"You mean I shouldn't help people?\" \"Of course you should help them. I didn't mean anything like that. Just ... well, you're getting too bound up in your work.\" \"Why shouldn't I be?\" Then the truth, as I thought, dawned on me. \"Are you jealous, Lucy?\" She lowered her eyes. \"Not only that, but the war's bound to come to an end, you know, and—\" It was the first part of her sentence that interested me. \"Why, do you mean—\" And just then a fresh batch of casualties arrived and I had to tend to them. For the next few days, I was so busy, I didn't get the chance to have the long talk with Lucy I'd wanted.... Then, after only four months, the war suddenly stopped. It seemed that the aliens' weapons, despite their undeniable mysteriousness, were not equal to ours. And they had the added disadvantage of being light-years away from home base. So the remnant of their fleet took off and blew itself up just outside of Mars, which we understood to be the equivalent of unconditional surrender. And it was; we never heard from the Centaurians again. Peace once more. I had a little mopping up to do at the hospital; then I collected my possessions and went back home after a dignitary—only the Vice President this time—had thanked me on behalf of a grateful country.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the Tellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the viscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a jaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport for two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a miasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across the mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was dropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find the way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus. Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth of feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together they sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor. The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship Aphrodite loomed unhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the ventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the fat spaceship. \"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\" Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley—\"Cob\" to his friends—nodded in agreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship with the poison personality.\" Cob was the Aphrodite's Executive, and he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs on the Aphrodite . She generally sent them Earthside with nervous breakdowns in half that time. \"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen that you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I thought....\" \"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski. Cob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\" \"The same.\" \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's a prize stinker ... but you were in command of the Ganymede . And, after all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come this?\" He indicated the monitor expressively. Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with me and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you wouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp operators.

Call it luck or temperament or what have you. \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too much on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the Ganymede because I left my station where I was supposed to be running section-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in danger....\" \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob. \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical astrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my routine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No nova. I made an ass of myself and lost the Ganymede . Gorman gave it to his former aide. I got this.\" Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\" \"Me again. The Ganymede's whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig. We celebrated a bit too freely.\" Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night after the Ganymede broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run, wasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\" \"Canalopolis?\" Whitley nodded. \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian Embassy Ball.\" \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\" \"Strike's the name, Cob.\" Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like our old tin pot here.\" He patted the Aphrodite's nether belly affectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to meet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\" Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek Ganymede . \"She'll carry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\" Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket fuel, anyway. Deep space?\" Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\" Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run.

{"chunk_id": "Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_2#0", "contents": "And she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed Aphrodite was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten years back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation Incident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a surge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the planner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its formative stage, and at the time of the Aphrodite's launching the surge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives. Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit for her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed of hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The Artemis , the Andromeda , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The three vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid had set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine. All three were miserable failures. The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit too appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way, wrongly. The Artemis exploded. The Andromeda vanished in the general direction of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a ruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions. And the Aphrodite's starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her store of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under 20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a tangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull. The Aphrodite was refitted for space. And because it was an integral part of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became a workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She carried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and tanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from Venusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation. Regulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet required it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see to it that she did.... The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted smartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve. Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a third of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet Fleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship of his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere. Cob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign. Radar Officer. She's good, too.\" Strike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me uncomfortable.\" Cob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our ratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\" \"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named this ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\" Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.

Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge bulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle of chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an acceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit rheostat. \"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob. Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the Ganymede's flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\" The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship, hugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike reached for the squawk-box control. \"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying bridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will recall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\" Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner. \"Orders, Captain?\" \"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here. They're sending someone down from the Antigone , and I expect him by 600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See to it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start loading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he paused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\" Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant Hendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\" Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V. Hendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\""}

She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale blue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the shoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the obvious trimness of her figure. Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others. \"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles of Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition, we have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'm certain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy who designed her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs are specific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Your astrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or minus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit. Now be certain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins, especially in the hydroponic cells. Pure air is going to be important.\" \"That's about all there is to tell you. As soon as our rather leisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard.\" He nodded. \"That's the story. Lift ship in....\" He glanced at his wrist chronograph, \"... in an hour and five.\" The officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room. \"Captain?\" \"Come in, Cob.\" Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformed girl in the doorway. Cob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind his eyes. \"Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? Lieutenant I-vy Hendricks?\" Strike looked blankly at the girl. \"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley. \"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find to say. The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her voice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your permission to inspect the drives, Captain, I may be able to convince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem to think ... a senile incompetent.\" Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ... Miss ... but why should you be so....\" The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan Hendricks, Captain, is my father.\""}

Jetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous Aphrodite had burned a steering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall while Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected repairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running ten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation Officer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the orbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall. The Aphrodite rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury.... For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in space, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between them. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her father's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was little she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy spent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit that he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman. And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike did. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was dedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong. There's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy. At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the Aphrodite's refrigeration units could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable temperature. The thermometer stood at 102°F, the very metal of the ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded, insignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and spaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the sodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to their shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing. Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham called to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The IFF showed the pips to be the Lachesis and the Atropos . The two dreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely routine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath was Celia Graham's notation that the Atropos carried none other than Space Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan. Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into Hell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so. And she agreed."}
{"chunk_id": "Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_5#0", "contents": "Old Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The thermometer stood at 135° and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia Graham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's weight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without speaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression. Lieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist, in the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California womanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food.... And then it happened. Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the scrambler. It was a distress signal from the Lachesis . The Atropos had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun. Radiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the Atropos skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star. The Lachesis had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly trying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering power of the Lachesis' mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's deathgrip on the battleship. A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport, but they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that even the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled Atropos away from a fiery end. Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the flying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of Strykalski's face. \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\" \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the message and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head. She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is it ! This is the chance I've been praying for, Strike!\" He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall I said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those ships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the Lachesis , he won't let go that line even if he fries himself.\" Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it! I mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat. \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that you've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that the last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of the woodwork ... very messily, too.\" \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you are suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying to pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown skyhigh three times out of three.

But are you so certain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ... it'll be the last. For all of us.\" \"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply. Strike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in here?\" Whitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\" Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon. And me so young and pretty.\" Strike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\" \"Evans here,\" came the reply. \"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the Atropos and hold it. We'll home on their carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plot the course.\" \"Yes, Captain.\" Strike turned to Cob. \"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the black-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hinges of hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.\" \"Yes, sir!\" Cob saluted and was gone. Strike returned to the squawk-box. \"Radar!\" \"Graham here,\" replied Celia from her station. \"Get a radar fix on the Lachesis and hold it. Send your dope up to Evans and tell him to send us a range estimate.\" \"Yes, Captain,\" the girl replied crisply. \"Gun deck!\" \"Gun deck here, sir,\" came a feminine voice. \"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool of cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.\" \"Yes, sir!\" The girl switched off. \"And now you, Miss Hendricks.\" \"Yes, Captain?\" Her voice was low. \"Take over Control ... and Ivy....\" \"Yes?\" \"Don't kill us off.\" He smiled down at her. She nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothly she turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward...."}

The frantic flame that lashed out from the Lachesis' tube was fading, her fission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms. Still she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she save her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles of the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences that spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for the trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins, the gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning to melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants on the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were dying. Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her flying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in the darkened viewport. The temperature stood at 140° and the air was bitter with the smell of hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with perspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped for breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with apprehension. Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on the gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the Atropos . It plunged straight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against the hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly, a robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure. Like cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three spacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge together. They were diving into the sun. The heat in the Aphrodite's bridge was unbearable. The thermometer showed 145° and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by comparison. Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came out of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field of vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit rheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious, but too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument panel. \" Ivy! \" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm. \"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the show ... after ... all.\" Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the control panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on the surge-circuit. Slowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within old Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the circuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the tube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in space slowed. Stopped.

Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed. Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've sent him.\" The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not large for a manufacturing plant—it took a scant minute to exhaust its sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three. He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer, more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen. There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners. They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large as they should have been for a plant this size. Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the street, and the only other door was at the loading bay—big enough to handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the employees' entrance was on the third side. It wasn't."}
{"chunk_id": "LEX_2#0", "contents": "Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run, set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr. Manners?\" \"What?\" he panted. \"Who—?\" \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked. He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\" \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open for him. He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within. \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\" Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another, all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an interview—and it's not your fault—this whole setup is geared to unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal. He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath, straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying for a position should. \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association—\" \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\" He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable. He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension. The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed paintings—by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with flowers!—made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor into Hollywood's idea of an office. His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted for another instant. This was a citadel of a man—great girders of frame supporting buttresses of muscle—with a vaulting head and drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it. But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble. \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly."}

He'd been jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a reply that would cost him this job. \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you have any knowledge of medicine?\" \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment. \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean things like cell structure, neural communication—the basics of how we live.\" \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\" \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\" Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\" \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them out of you.\" \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball. \"How long have you been out of school?\" \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association—\" \"No practical experience to speak of?\" \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The company—\" \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said. Peter blinked. \"Sir?\" \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\" \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\" \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\" \"Did what come out—\" \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington. \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them with money—cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too, aren't you?\" \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in calculus.\" \"Just as I said—they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of these birds that had the shot paid for him?\" \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly. \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to get a job with someone else?\" Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated. \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been easy.\" \"Impossible, you mean.

{"chunk_id": "LEX_4#0", "contents": "It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play this straight all the way. He nodded. \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting. \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere—\" \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\" Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has been, yes.\" \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why? So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this stockpiling outfit?\" \"That's right.\" \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the hell of it is that they can't stop—when one does it, they all have to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the solution?\" \"I don't know,\" Peter said. Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made. What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\" \"You said you wanted an engineer.\" \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left school. I have, haven't I?\" \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily. \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school. Right?\" Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\" \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded. Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes, Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him! \"No, you're not.\" \"Then what am I after?\" \"Suppose you tell me.\" So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made—the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right. Those were the important things. The background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable. I think you are. Am I right?\" \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if that answers the question.\" \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\" In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors, the lack of employees' entrances. \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic doors.

Automated plants were nothing new, but they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the goods. \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show you.\""}
{"chunk_id": "LEX_5#0", "contents": "The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck loading door he had seen from outside. Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these materials handling machines.\" Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected. They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms, fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness. Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really, these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\" Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second, and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and other materials were stored. \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received, it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if the withdrawal of the materials"}

{"chunk_id": "LEX_6#0", "contents": "Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines, each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of doing it. He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to go by. Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\" \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\" asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that had engulfed him. \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in every week that—it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\" The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the silence remain unbroken. Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\" \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe twenty years in the future.\" \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back. \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their idiotic notions about specialization.\" Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief. Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably, although it hadn't been strenuous."}

{"chunk_id": "LEX_7#0", "contents": "He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\" \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\" \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else. They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering, determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\" Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy, because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way. After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business, was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out—well, I remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the girl. \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more business I got, and the more I had to expand.\" Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school, and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it.

It took me three years, but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember, compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today, of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the work for me. \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically, and once I'd done that, the battle was over. \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the money.\" \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked."}
{"chunk_id": "LEX_8#0", "contents": "Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my assets, but only one employee—me. \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns. \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of activity that I'd already established.\" Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received, every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\" \"I—I don't understand,\" stammered Peter. \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late, or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day. Pretty soon the machine got the idea. \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other explanation. \"The machine had realized that whenever one"}

The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\" \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\""}
{"chunk_id": "LEX_9#0", "contents": "When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it. \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give me pleasure—because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be activated. \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\" At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface. Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\" Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\" A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\" Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said. \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington. \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of time, the gold leaf comes off!\" Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst, so he kept silent."}

{"chunk_id": "LEX_10#0", "contents": "Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money. I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn't fix for itself.\" Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits. It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny vocabulary—all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring. \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance—'Lex.' That shook me. You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course, but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums I threw might be imitated.\" \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in. \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered—too late—that the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of, and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually nothing to do.\" \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled. \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed, and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.

Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of Planets. An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept. Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship, to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors. He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd have been better than nothing. In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en Korvin was all alone. True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him. He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a full stock of food concentrates. But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation. As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened.

But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation. As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor. The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green. He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories, but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin really didn't care about it; it was none of his business. The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are Korvin,\" he said. It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he replied. The green being nodded. \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him. \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and carefully constructed than even those marvels. \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the door-frame. \"You have other questions?\" Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better than solitude. \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a second. \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last. Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come to you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with you.\" It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language, and"}

Such is his command.\" Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the command of the Ruler,\" he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to try. But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from the rest of the galaxy forever. That, after all, was his job."}
{"chunk_id": "LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_2#0", "contents": "The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown, of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was, Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in. The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues, six and a half feet high. Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler. He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions. The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race. The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity. Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I am,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\" \"Within what limits?\" Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others under four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height were at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he went on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call these children ,\" he volunteered helpfully. \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he said. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\" Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he said apologetically. \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered. \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can for you.\" \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He paused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he went on. \"Why?\" \"My job required it,\" Korvin said. \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations prove that beyond any doubt.\" \"True,\" Korvin said. \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\" Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you have tests for such matters?\" \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology. It will be attached to you.\" Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt himself marveling again at this race.

It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle. The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable addition to the Comity of Nations. Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly. He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most strongly that he stay alive. He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final screws, he made no resistance. \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\" \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably. \"Are you standing or sitting?\" \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said. \"Are you a chulad ?\" the Ruler asked. A chulad was a small native pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch beetle. \"I am not,\" he said."}
{"chunk_id": "LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_3#0", "contents": "The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on receiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you standing or sitting?\" \"I am standing,\" Korvin said. The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning manner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now continue.\" Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and the training. He hoped they were right. The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive. \"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said. \"My job required it,\" Korvin said. The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\" Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said. The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the ship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't ended , nor did it mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant \"disposed of for all time.\" \"No,\" he said. \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said. Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying alive.\" The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted. \"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer correctly.\" \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said. \"But it is not—not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said. Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\" \"I—\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the Ruler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of logic\"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean right-saying —\"who will advise the Ruler. They will be called.\" Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler gestured and they went out the door in a hurry. The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick us,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"— chulad-like Korvin translated—\"attempts will get you nowhere.\" Korvin devoutly hoped so."}

{"chunk_id": "LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_4#0", "contents": "The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself, the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around were so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated mathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told Korvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics. But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be confused by such means.\" \"Good,\" Korvin said. The experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said. \"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone. The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his best not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different from the one we are occupied with.\" \"True,\" Korvin said. There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\" he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper. \"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said. The silence this time was even longer. \"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last, in a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet. You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly to aid us.\" Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the only logical deduction. But it happened to be wrong."}
{"chunk_id": "LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_5#0", "contents": "\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor, but a logical race does not trust him. \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said. \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said. \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names to it, that was all. It had none of its own. \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said. \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\" \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said. \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said. There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said. \"I can,\" Korvin said. \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on. \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\" \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or does it exist alone?\" Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said. A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible system. Is it the system you mean?\" Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said. \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\" the Ruler said. \"It is,\" Korvin said. \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said. The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time. \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\" \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is this agreed?\" \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\" \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which are governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on. \"True,\" Korvin said. \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said. \"True,\" Korvin said again. The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said. Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\" The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to Korvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way unable to describe this government?\" \"It can be"}

It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction, Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance. The plan was taking hold. The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to confuse us,\" he said. Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to confuse you.\" \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said. \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said. The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer it if we see fit to do so.\" Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your government?\" The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and began. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he said in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady judgment.\" \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you will define yours for us.\" Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you won't understand it.\" The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs you?\" \"None,\" Korvin said. \"But you are governed?\" Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\" \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted. \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\" \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single decision.\" \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\" \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\" \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to accept them.\" \"Do you act against your own interests?\" Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them, perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth wasn't making any sense. \"I told you you"}

They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them, perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth wasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he said. \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled. \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said. The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said. \"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—\" \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like yourselves.\" \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—\" \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly. \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why not?\" \"We call our form of government democracy ,\" Korvin said. \"It means the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\" One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each other?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his force, there can be no effective rule.\" \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said. \"You are lying,\" the expert said. One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us—\" \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\" Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting homesick. It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in. Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements. Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled. On the third day Korvin escaped. It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that, and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated. That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to intervene somewhere. And it couldn't. Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the problem was insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of thinking.

Any insight at all into the mental sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his entire plan, within seconds. But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en. The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell. He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive messages, but he could send them. He sent one now. Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it! With one government and one language, they just weren't equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences, no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no translation. But—damn it—I wish I were home already. I'm bored absolutely stiff! THE END"}

[Transcriber's Note: Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] THE MAN WHO RATIONED BABIES By the 23rd century Earth's population had reached seven billion. Mankind was in danger of perishing for lack of elbow room—unless prompt measures were taken. Roy Walton had the power to enforce those measures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon found himself the most hated man in the world. For it was his job to tell parents their children were unfit to live; he had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote areas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens, denounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a decision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies, become a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly. In other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH? CAST OF CHARACTERS ROY WALTON He had to adopt the motto— the ends justify the means . FITZMAUGHAM His reward for devoted service was—an assassin's bullet. FRED WALTON His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes—but he underestimated their size. LEE PERCY His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills. PRIOR With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son? DR. LAMARRE He died for discovering the secret of immortality. Contents I The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known as Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors of the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of twenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy Walton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself each morning as he entered the hideous place. Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office—on the twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's—but that had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant building. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though necessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the Bureau did not rate attractive quarters. So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that trimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed the massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the mark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and office. Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last century's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all. His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via pneumochute every minute.

It was the last century's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all. His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via pneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was a thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director FitzMaugham, and half the pay. He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly paper carefully, and read it. It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in Patagonia. It was dated 4 June 2232 , six days before, and after a long and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to say, Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far below optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization. Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo from Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused, picking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the section chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability of transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia? Recommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease transition.\" He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light shot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by the multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand Belgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director FitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims, If you want to stay sane, think of these people as pawns in a chess game—not as human beings. Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of humanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate in a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so long, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before trouble came. There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the voicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re establishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff of three clever girls to make a précis of each report, eliminating irrelevant data.\" It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now, with three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One of the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so suddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage. He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of the Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During the past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard adults had been sent on to Happysleep. That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed the report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute. The annunciator chimed. \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately. \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said. \"He insists it's"}

The annunciator chimed. \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately. \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said. \"He insists it's an emergency.\" \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton stared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he can have ten minutes with me at—oh, say, 1300.\" Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer office, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you immediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\" \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in the world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just been committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\" Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge of his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this ugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to see one of those people and try to convince him of the need— The door burst open. A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and paused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him came three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security. They carried drawn needlers. \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly deep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\" The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of them turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this, sir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in here, but he did.\" \"Ah—yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning to assassinate anybody, will you?\" \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can you accuse me of—\" One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge to reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all. \"Search him,\" Walton said. They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton. Should we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\" \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\" \"Are you sure you—\" \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked away, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for protecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here and get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's simply that I'm indispensable.

There isn't another lunatic in the world who'd take this job. Now get out !\" They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed and jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly unjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations prescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit that to the guards. \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\" \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said, without a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a terribly busy man.\" \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's desk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the psychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have had you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little diversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\" \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a man. \"I hadn't expected to find—I mean that you—\" \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping for?\" Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted. Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do something when I go home at night. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No more than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite remarkable.\" \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently. \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles. Ten years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize. Now it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr. Prior—and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is. Take Yeats, for instance—\" Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior back to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand, anything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him. \"Mr. Walton....\" \"Yes?\" \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\" Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt cold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy. \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning—potentially tubercular. The boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you—\" Walton rose. \" No ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't ask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're an intelligent man; you understand our program.\" \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the Euthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected—\" \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for other people. So did everyone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly he said, \"I can't do it.

I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a baby every chance to live.\" \" I was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced euthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\" It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it. \"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe it out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic traits.\" \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked. \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr. Prior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do the impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\" Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly at Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton feared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his upper left desk drawer. But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly. \"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\" Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and slipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the chute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three basilisks. In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been ticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes had been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been sterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves ahead of time. It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn generations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal progeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain, consuming precious food? Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his team succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light outfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about Earth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was still growing. Prior's words haunted him. I was tubercular ... where would my poems be now? The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been tubercular too. What good are poets? he asked himself savagely. The reply came swiftly: What good is anything, then? Keats, Shakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How much duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing his bookshelf—his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a one-room home.

The reply came swiftly: What good is anything, then? Keats, Shakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How much duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing his bookshelf—his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a one-room home. Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision. The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he admitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it would be a criminal act. But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one. Prior's baby. With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there are any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for the next half-hour.\" II He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer office was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening letters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into the hallway. There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the lift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek was organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the second-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a single child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking as effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought about repeal of the entire Equalization Law. Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child, and after that I'll keep within the law. He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The clinic was on the twentieth floor. \"Roy.\" At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise. He steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood there. \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly, his mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy. Something the matter?\" Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been a lot of work lately.\" As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek worked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham had striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at the age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving mankind from itself. The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength, Roy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad you're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning, though. Mind if I join you?\" \"I'm—not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\" \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\" \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried, drawn, and quartered. \"It requires"}

Can't you take care of it by phone?\" \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried, drawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\" \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a little, I think.\" \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\" FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid you'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\" The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director to enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed Fourteen ; there was a coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed twenty , covering the panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his destination. As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to see you this morning?\" \"Yes,\" Walton said. \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\" \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly. \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was on his mind?\" Walton hesitated. \"He—he wanted his son spared from Happysleep. Naturally, I had to turn him down.\" \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one exception, the whole framework crumbles.\" \"Of course, sir.\" The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back, revealing a neat, gleaming sign: FLOOR 20 Euthanasia Clinic and Files Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided traveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem nakedly obvious now. The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\" he said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really should take some time off for relaxation each day.\" \"I'll try, sir.\" Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the door closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone. Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And damn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know! Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep breath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia files were kept."}
{"chunk_id": "MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_1#7", "contents": "files were kept."}
{"chunk_id": "MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_2#0", "contents": "The room was large, as rooms went nowadays—thirty by twenty, with deck upon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a bank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek had piled up an impressive collection of data. While he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts poured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night. \"Can I help—oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician said. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless and without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything I can do?\" \"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\" \"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\" Walton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically backed out of his presence. No doubt I must radiate charisma , he thought. Within the building he wore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's protégé and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the crowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to himself. Frowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip, wasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior. A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic circuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson tubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a yellow-brown card dropped out of the slot: 3216847AB1 PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital, New York. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard. Wgt. at birth 5lb. 3oz. An elaborate description of the boy in great detail followed, ending with blood type, agglutinating characteristic, and gene-pattern, codified. Walton skipped impatiently through that and came to the notification typed in curt, impersonal green capital letters at the bottom of the card: EXAMINED AT N Y EUTH CLINIC 10 JUNE 2332 EUTHANASIA RECOMMENDED He glanced at his watch: the time was 1026. The boy was probably still somewhere in the clinic lab, waiting for the figurative axe to descend. Walton had set up the schedule himself: the gas chamber delivered Happysleep each day at 1100 and 1500. He had about half an hour to save Philip Prior. He peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slipped the baby's card into his breast pocket. That done, he typed out a requisition for explanation of the gene-sorting code the clinic used. Symbols began pouring forth, and Walton puzzledly correlated them with the line of gibberish on Phillip Prior's record card. Finally he found the one he wanted: 3f2, tubercular-prone . He scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to the machine. Revision of card number 3216847AB1 follows. Please alter in all circuits. He proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol 3f2 and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version. The machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. So far, so good. Then, he requested the boy's file all over"}

As far as the machine was concerned, Philip Prior was a normal, healthy baby. He glanced at his watch. 1037. Still twenty-three minutes before this morning's haul of unfortunates was put away. Now came the real test: could he pry the baby away from the doctors without attracting too much attention to himself in the process?"}
{"chunk_id": "MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_3#0", "contents": "Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main section of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there, each in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one to the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above. The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its local clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a certificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a certificate ... and life. \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\" Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to keep in touch with every department we have, you know.\" \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're really getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\" \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could do about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his protégé to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose. \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked. \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him for you, Mr. Walton?\" \"No—no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly, Walton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in the employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and Roy did not care to have Fred know he was down there. Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump, squalling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\" \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc, two blind, one congenital syph.\" \"That only makes six,\" Walton said. \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet. Seven in one morning.\" \"Have any trouble with the parents?\" \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to understand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\" Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm. Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it up for you if you like.\" \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly. He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution chamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at his desk when Walton appeared. Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He was short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact lenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\" \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\" \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\" \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said. \"To keep public opinion on our side.\" \"Sir?\" \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that comes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no mistake. Got that?\" \" Mistake? But how—\" \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one of the European centers yesterday."}

Got that?\" \" Mistake? But how—\" \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one of the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets out.\" How glibly I reel this stuff off , Walton thought in amazement. Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check everything from now on.\" \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\" Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left via a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube. Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a towering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He remembered what FitzMaugham had said: Once we make even one exception, the whole framework crumbles. Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little doubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he had done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow. The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling you, sir.\" \"Put him on.\" The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had given way to wild-eyed tenseness. \"What is it, Doctor?\" \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll never guess what just happened—\" \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\" \"I—well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this morning. And guess—I mean—well, one of them shouldn't have been sent to me!\" \"No!\" \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card right here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is fine.\" \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked. \"No, sir.\" Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great anxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet. Someone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that there's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us in half an hour.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\" \"Don't say a word about this to anyone , not even the men in the examining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents, apologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for any future cases of this sort.\" \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\" \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep breath and stared bleakly at the far wall. The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law—the Equalization Law—Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal as the man who tried to"}

Is that all?\" \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep breath and stared bleakly at the far wall. The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law—the Equalization Law—Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal as the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators, or the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor. He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and the Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done it, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position—his life, even—for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby. Well, the thing was done. No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to finish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant places and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's activities. The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\" Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred never called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And Walton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this call. No good at all. III Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of the swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built closer to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven, next to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\" with his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to Fred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height. Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of tremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to take shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What goes?\" His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here a little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\" \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't have time.\" Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's lapel, and refused to look anywhere else. Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\" \"Official business!\" \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to be using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was curious—unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of your conversation with the machine.\" Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb. He managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and say, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek computer outlet is confidential.\" \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two"}

He managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and say, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek computer outlet is confidential.\" \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh, Roy?\" \"How much do you know?\" \"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system, would you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of this, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton doesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble—oh, no!\" \"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly. \"You got me this job. You can take it away. Let's call it even for now, shall we?\" \"Anything you like,\" Walton said. He was drenched in sweat, though the ingenious executive filter in the sending apparatus of the screen cloaked that fact and presented him as neat and fresh. \"I have some work to do now.\" His voice was barely audible. \"I won't keep you any longer, then,\" Fred said. The screen went dead. Walton killed the contact at his end, got up, walked to the window. He nudged the opaquer control and the frosty white haze over the glass cleared away, revealing the fantastic beehive of the city outside. Idiot! he thought. Fool! He had risked everything to save one baby, one child probably doomed to an early death anyway. And FitzMaugham knew—the old man could see through Walton with ease—and Fred knew, too. His brother, and his father-substitute. FitzMaugham might well choose to conceal Roy's defection this time, but would surely place less trust in him in the future. And as for Fred.... There was no telling what Fred might do. They had never been particularly close as brothers; they had lived with their parents (now almost totally forgotten) until Roy was nine and Fred seven. Their parents had gone down off Maracaibo in a jet crash; Roy and Fred had been sent to the public crèche. After that it had been separate paths for the brothers. For Roy, an education in the law, a short spell as Senator FitzMaugham's private secretary, followed last month by his sudden elevation to assistant administrator of the newly-created Popeek Bureau.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot platinum desk at his assembled staff. \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\" There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward, looking solemn. \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused for effect. \"They have now reappeared—occupying the inner planet of this system!\" \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited Terrestrial territory....\" \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder before him, harrumphed and read aloud: His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive, Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence, and let Those who dare gird for the contest. \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said. Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger. \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\" \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out—\" the Military Attache began. \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested frowns to settle into place. \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial controlled soil—and without so much as a flicker from the instruments of the Navigational Monitor Service!\" The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth slapped the table. \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is—the Qornt fleets are indetectible!\""}
{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_2#0", "contents": "The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime—\" \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a couple of volunteers with plastic beaks—\" \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive, well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any recommendation?\" The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\" \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm, dignified, aggressive withdrawal—as soon as possible.\" \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal—say, until tomorrow.\" \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\" \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions. Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan eased toward the door. \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped. \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to let us know how it works out.\" \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these Qornt personally.\" Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly. \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\" \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my head and do something rash if I go.\" \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along. No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the transport pool at once. Now get going!\" Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall. \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned. \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves—in any direction.\" II Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of white beach with the blue sea beyond. \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report—\" \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can"}

We'll go back now and report—\" \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can observe.\" \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to think of sightseeing.\" \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\" \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're questioning Corps policy!\" \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\" \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\" \"It's directly down-slope—\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan clutched at his arm. There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin, green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed as the creature cocked its head, listening. Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of a giant trunk. \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps into the brush. A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun, darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free, turned—and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs. Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly. \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of them.\""}
{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_3#0", "contents": "\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said. \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\" The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green trousers. \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to you.\" Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering with peaceable diplomats in future.\" \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\" \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk about. How many of you are there?\" \"Only Zubb and myself.\" \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\" The alien whistled shrilly. \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around. \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\" \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\" \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished—\" a small whistle escaped—\"at being taken for a Qornt.\" \"Aren't you a Qornt?\" \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it happens.\" \"You certainly look like Qornt.\" \"Oh, not at all—except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course, they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\" \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\" \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\" \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock—descended from a common ancestor, perhaps.\" \"We are all Pud's creatures.\" \"What are the differences between you, then?\" \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\" \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked."}
{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_4#0", "contents": "The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\" \"The outer planet of this system.\" \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to such matters.\" \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they said.\" \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\" Retief asked. \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\" \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the evacuees!\" \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\" \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\" \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed. \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\" \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in all?\" Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only. There are more at the other Centers, of course.\" \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum—unilaterally?\" \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\" Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants. \"What did he say?\" \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to gather you as specimens.\" \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan. \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked. \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\" \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic accent.\" \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of reception would we get?\" \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy mating—such a tedious business—and of course the Qornt are tied up with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice of you.\" \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne—who openly avow their occupied world—would ignore Terrestrials in their midst?\" \"If at all possible.\" Retief got to his feet. \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and attract a little attention.\" III \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun—Oh, they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led into a trap?\" \"We can't.\" Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\" \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush—\" Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\" The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great brush-grown mound."}

Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope. \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll excuse us, I hope—\" \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back. \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are plotting mischief.\" \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\" \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a patient man, but there are occasions—\" \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk—\" \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\" \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\" \"This is Tarroon?\" \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\" \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening. The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch, ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what appeared to be primitive incandescent panels. \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\" Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\" \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely. \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've scheduled an invasion for next month.\" \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\" \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\" \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\" \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely—\" \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques before, but this is madness!\" \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward."}

{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_5#0", "contents": "The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles—and cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board. Lesser trolls—beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed—trotted briskly, bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow. \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed. \"Now we'd better be getting back.\" \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt—the tallest of the feasters—he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\" \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really must hurry along—\" \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from the other Centers as well.\" \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\" \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\" \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type, tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\" \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts. They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given his ship.\" \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set of toy sailboats!\" Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\" \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll kindly step along, gentlemen....\" \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer the matter to committee.\" \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss having a cosy chat.\" There was a pause. \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most compelling argument....\""}

{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_6#0", "contents": "Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at Magnan's chest. \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented. \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started. \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\" \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now step along, please.\" \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\" \"I doubt it.\" \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\" \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\" \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat, staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past, followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table faded. Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his chair—a low, heavily padded stool—and stared unwinking at Retief, moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of pink pearls had slipped down above one eye. Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard. Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched. \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him, but he's got timbre.\" \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time? A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the table. \"The answer is no !\" Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger; you'd best chain him, too.\" \"Why, your Excellency—\" Magnan started, stepping forward. \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on you.\" \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered—\" \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries! I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\""}

{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_7#0", "contents": "There was a momentary silence from all sides. \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with flame-colored plumes. Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I thought I'd made my point!\" \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\" \"You bet.\" \"I'm convinced.\" Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's us.\" \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented. Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring eyes. \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\" \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration—\" \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\" He belched again. A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place. \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms. Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the ends and closed it. \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\" \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly. \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion: we carve them up a little—lop off the external labiae and pinnae, say—and ship them back.\" \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\" \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\" Retief commented. \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\" \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\" Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\" he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\" \"Well,\" Magnan started. \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\" \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet. \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\" \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\" Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver an Ultimatum.\" \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered. \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new type hell bomb we've worked out.

He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I—\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering. \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled. Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\" he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\" \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\" \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\" \"That's all right. They don't have one.\" \"But—\" \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in battle! We live in fame or go down in—\" \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn, we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to prove anything.\" \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the rest of the boys would listen to reason—\" \"Over my dead body!\" \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\""}
{"chunk_id": "MIGHTIEST_QORN_8#0", "contents": "Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And did you notice the size of those hands?\" Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings. \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds here.\" \"But that phenomenal reach—\" \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me, I'll get a crack at him.\" Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort. \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\" Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens—both servitors and bejeweled Qornt—formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the combatants. Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn bent to haul Retief from his leg—and staggered back as a haymaker took him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief leaped clear. Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching in vain for Retief. Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him. \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested parties.\" Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your weapons, Zubb.\" \"Look here,\" Zubb began. \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned back to watch the encounter. Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly. \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip. Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs and gay silks. Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called. The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications—\" \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly.

And, of course, as Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush things?\" \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\" \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one among us who's a slave to instinct—and, naturally, we have to follow him.\" \"Why?\" \"Because that's the way it's done.\" \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest community singing—\" \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would happen?\" \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled. \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with the new Qornt stepping on our heels—\" \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\" \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course. The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize into Verpp—\" \"You mean Slun and Zubb—the mild-natured naturalists—will become warmongers like Qorn?\" \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old saying goes.\" \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked. \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\" \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\" \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you Terrestrials over on Guzzum—that was a mad notion. We had no idea what your strength was.\" \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've had diplomatic relations and all—\" \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\" \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\" \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other Centers—all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is definitely on.\" \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could name some very attractive prospects—outside my sector, of course.\" \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal here....\" V At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief and Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT Sector HQ.

Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged, flying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white. \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the white ensign might be?\" Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements and a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high white sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes, butts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather. \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the idea has merit.\" The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired wheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat stepped out. \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\" \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt to get you out of this.\" He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at the ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong—and beyond, at the eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts. \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking up at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I assume?\" \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly. \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate Headquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on. \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This—\" \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth hissed over his shoulder. \"Now—\" \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted, eyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up. \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the invasion—\" \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve. \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped. He rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to evacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested—\" \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked. \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered. Instructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any other instructions you might have.\" \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said. \"This isn't—\" \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at Retief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed a length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and held him facing Retief. \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr. Ambassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this isn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace Enforcement Corps.\" Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's mouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that the establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P.

Nitworth purpled. \"You're skirting insolence, Magnan,\" he roared. \"Why was I not informed of the arrangements? What was I to assume at the sight of eighty-five war vessels over my headquarters, unannounced?\" \"We tried to get through, but our wavelengths—\" \"Bah! Sterner souls than I would have quailed at the spectacle!\" \"Oh, you were perfectly justified in panicking—\" \"I did not panic!\" Nitworth bellowed. \"I merely adjusted to the apparent circumstances. Now, I'm of two minds as to the advisability of this foreign legion idea of yours. Still, it may have merit. I believe the wisest course would be to dispatch them on a long training cruise in an uninhabited sector of space—\" The office windows rattled. \"What the devil!\" Nitworth turned, stared out at the ramp where a Qornt ship rose slowly on a column of pale blue light. The vibration increased as a second ship lifted, then a third. Nitworth whirled on Magnan. \"What's this! Who ordered these recruits to embark without my permission?\" \"I took the liberty of giving them an errand to run, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said. \"There was that little matter of the Groaci infiltrating the Sirenian System. I sent the boys off to handle it.\" \"Call them back at once!\" \"I'm afraid that won't be possible. They're under orders to maintain total communications silence until completion of the mission.\" Nitworth drummed his fingers on the desk top. Slowly, a thoughtful expression dawned. He nodded. \"This may work out,\" he said. \"I should call them back, but since the fleet is out of contact, I'm unable to do so, correct? Thus I can hardly be held responsible for any over-enthusiasm in chastising the Groaci.\" He closed one eye in a broad wink at Magnan. \"Very well, gentlemen, I'll overlook the irregularity this time. Magnan, see to it the Smorbrodian public are notified they can remain where they are. And by the way, did you by any chance discover the technique of the indetectable drive the Qornt use?\" \"No, sir. That is, yes, sir.\" \"Well? Well?\" \"There isn't any. The Qornt were there all the while. Underground.\" \"Underground? Doing what?\" \"Hibernating—for two hundred years at a stretch.\""}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws groping into space, and then the star-port closed. There was another dead man aboard the Constellation . Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him; machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet, keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm. Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship. Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor warrior's body out of the void. He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke, who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a decent burial. \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice from the ceiling radio hit Burnett. \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five, ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded deep. It didn't belong to him anymore. Rice said: \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day drunk!\" Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships, salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict. Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again. Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved for action. This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why! \"Sam!\" Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins. \"Sam! On the double!

Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins. \"Sam! On the double!

Nothing unusual about a body with blood cooling in it."}

He climbed without making any noise on the rungs. He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with the war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited glory are always a million miles ahead. He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with the war. You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your ribs. You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock. That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing. You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be. After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing your job with mechanical hands. But even a machine breaks down...."}
{"chunk_id": "Morgue_Ship_3#0", "contents": "\"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder. Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy official. \"Take a look at this!\" Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it was. Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead. Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way, stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle. Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\" Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\" Burnett scowled uneasily and said no. \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted. Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That right?\" \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\" Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell. What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone else. Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think! Kriere—The All-Mighty—in our territory. His right hand man dead. That means Kriere was in an accident, too!\" Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves. \"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine. \"As for Kriere—if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution is taken to protect that one.\" \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\" \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a battle-cuiser to go against him?\" \"We'll radio for help?\" \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\" Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted, \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\" Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and days and see how patriotic you feel.

All those fine muscled lads bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone—\" Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes. He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship, hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat. \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here—what's his name? Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\" Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time. Lethla was alive. He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream. He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what language it would use if it had to. Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it like a dead cold star. Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight, biting lines into his sharp face. Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly. \"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\" A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You never catch up with the war! But what if the war catches up with you? What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?"}
{"chunk_id": "Morgue_Ship_4#0", "contents": "Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen. He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it, Earthman.\" \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\" Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible at all.\" Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and quick. Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\" Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's your radio?\" \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly. \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused. \"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and coils. The radio. Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by the new bitterness in it. Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs. He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk—\" Rice said it, slow: \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead men belong here.\" Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first—we must rescue Kriere....\" \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw. Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama. Lethla's voice came next: \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever. \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus. We were running out of fuel, food, water.

It was the first time we had ever tried using them to trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\" Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe to Venus.\" Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\" \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice. \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches. \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be picked up— now! \""}
{"chunk_id": "Morgue_Ship_5#0", "contents": "Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\" \"No tricks,\" said Lethla. Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\" \"Follow me up the ladder.\" Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\" Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor. Rice grumbled and cursed after him. On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere. There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you never knew who it would be. He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals. Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a slow pace. Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape? See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out alive; if they cooperated. But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with the war again. The last trip! Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it? Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms, wet thin lips. \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily. Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\" \"Very,\" said Burnett. He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it would all be over. Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead, he squinted. \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good trick.\" \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\""}

Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen, eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars. \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear. If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that— Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat, water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored because of his gun. Kriere would make odds impossible. Something had to be done before Kriere came in. Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered, fooled—somehow. But—how? Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew, artery—heart. There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and this would be the last trip. Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear. \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the star-port.\" Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly. Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first, why— Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about to be rescued. Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he was about to end a ten-years' war. There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be fast. Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space. Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet, too. The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its slowness. It reached Kriere. Burnett inhaled a deep breath. The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm. Lethla watched. He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men"}

There was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the head, which was carefully preserved for identification. That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard. Burnett spun about and leaped. The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun. Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner. Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and started laughing. He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut. Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's young face over him. Burnett groaned. Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\" \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open. Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\" \"This is the hard way—\" \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago—\" Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of them out: \"Rice?\" \"Yeah, Sam?\" \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\" \"Full enough for me, sir.\" \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there—number ninety-eight is Lethla—number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back any way—but—the way—we used to—\" His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a million miles. \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\" Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to dissolve. Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere. He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed, thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the bailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as old Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done. She didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a girl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises. She was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified criminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if she had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types, and not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts. Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt certain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for the charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his laboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of the courtroom and down the corridor back to jail. Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back behind bars. \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said. Asa glared at him. \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the rap?\" \"Five or one.\" \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice air-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a lot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\" Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly with his head bent and turned to face Jumpy. \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going to be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt Slider eggs.\" \"Smuggling? It won't work.\" Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because he had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The Hazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years of so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's Planet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched world, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne. His only problem would be staying alive for a year."}

{"chunk_id": "MUCK_MAN_2#0", "contents": "An interview with a doctor from the Conversion Corps was required for all persons who elected changeling status. The law stated that potential changelings must be fully informed of the rights and hazards of altered shape before they signed a release. The requirement held whether or not the individual, like Asa, was already experienced. By the time humanity traveled to the stars, medical biology had made it possible to regenerate damaged or deficient organs of the body. Regeneration was limited only by advanced age. Sometime after a man's two hundredth year his body lost the ability to be coaxed into growing new cells. A fifth set of teeth was usually one's last. As long as senescence could be staved off, however, any man could have bulging biceps and a pencil waist, if he could pay for the treatment. Until the medical associations declared such treatments unethical there was even a short fad of deliberate deformities, with horns at the temples particularly popular. From regeneration it was a short step to specialized regrowth. The techniques were perfected to adapt humans to the dozen barely habitable worlds man had discovered. Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth in the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a man could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature controls than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets a few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were greater. Unfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone wanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed permitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one year as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had to spend in rehabilitation. \"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\" Asa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he asked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions. \"Four,\" answered the doctor. \"Squiffs for New Arcady. Adapted for climbing the skycraper trees and with the arm structure modified into pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we need spiderinos for Von Neumann Two. If you want the nearest thing we have to Earth, there's Caesar's Moon, where we'd just have to double your tolerance for carbon monoxide and make you a bigger and better gorilla than the natives. Last, of course, there's always a need for muck men on Jordan's Planet.\" The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to choose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the alternatives. \"What's the pay range?\" he asked. \"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von Neumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\" Asa raised his eyebrows. \"Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the mud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the changeling comfortable in his new environment?\" \"Sure they do,\" said the doctor. \"We can make you think mud feels better than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a grasshopper"}

But we can't make you like the sight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.\" \"Still,\" Asa mused aloud, \"it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the end of the year.\" He leaned forward to fill in the necessary form."}
{"chunk_id": "MUCK_MAN_3#0", "contents": "Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special environments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion chambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa Graybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard to bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner. Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once one of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on spaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he decided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all he learned about space travel. Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or cellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More important, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and had wanted to return. \"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The ones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun to die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to go crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine thousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that flashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\" Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could understand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while the albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic filaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played tiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life. Electrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but the phenomenon remained a mystery. Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to question its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only random, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of light, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance. It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and fading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had ever seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have made him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly. \"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are the egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when you scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.\" \"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the Sliders?\" Kershaw grinned. \"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping for home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand. When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in the mud where you were just"}

When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in the mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back and hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter comes—and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake—you live to tell the tale.\" II Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to learn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another physical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was pounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the doctor had apparently learned to make allowances. \"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests. Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning to lose consciousness. \"This is it!\" he thought in panic. He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before consciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance to back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the conversion tank right now. When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for a long time he was afraid to open his eyes. \"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\" It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his eyes. Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one stand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that his head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his lower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward so that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around as an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with broad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like claws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of hair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head. This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself. It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong traces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly emerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under those horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could still weep. He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed. \"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only try hopping this time. And take it easy.\" Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and"}

He found himself leaping as high as Kershaw's head. \"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll go outside.\" Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of fabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as Kershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room where they had been left to revive from conversion."}
{"chunk_id": "MUCK_MAN_4#0", "contents": "They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard was open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky of Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud flats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged along the wall were thirty stalls for muck men. From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them in two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were a gun and a long knife. \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big everywhere in proportion. \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\" \"I'm Graybar.\" \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on, you.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard. \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty and warden and parole officer rolled into one.\" Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his distorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown how to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim rockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a native vine. He did so and immediately vomited. Furston laughed. \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning. \"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any ideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is where you eat.\" Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He lifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from an observation tower on the roof. He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look. Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session with Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr. The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried him. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent position to make the riddance permanent. At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with the dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the two were doing out here. \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of the others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\" \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel he is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the operations.\" III Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to carry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and assigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called Graybar aside. \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said,"}

Finally he called Graybar aside. \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week knocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there and work that muck.\" Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could show Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the courtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it and hopped along after Kershaw. Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the Hazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The mud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was not at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins like a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded and splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced eye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud. \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here lately. If you see something like an express train headed our way, start shooting.\" At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no Sliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as much as on top of it. Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten yards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in the muck. \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg was laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to spot when the new weeds start growing.\" Kershaw took a long look around. \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\" They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs of mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually a muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw dug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had to dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit big enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently before it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he worked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything about the operation was wrong. \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping slime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to watch. \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still"}

He leaped out of the pit and started wiping slime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to watch. \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of mud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look at it.\" A SLIDER EGG The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds being splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's earphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the scintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider for help. Asa looked around. \"Jump!\" he shouted. At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black scales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the weeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row upon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered its head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot forward. Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing. While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio down from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned instantly, his gun in his hand. \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw and Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\" \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\" \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\" \"On the way.\" Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by the Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the other had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where Kershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working madly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another charge. Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The rocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray flesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward Asa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw the Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs were tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the Slider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he thrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired again. Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered with shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion. Desperately"}

{"chunk_id": "MUCK_MAN_5#0", "contents": "Asa took a deep breath and looked around. \"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\" \"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again. Asa leaped over to him. \"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good one. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\" \"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over at the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on getting killed doing this?\" \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six eggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring the eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\" Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance where it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried the egg. \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained. \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the 'copter, late as usual.\" The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and settled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see Tom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open and leaned out. \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\" \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll get the egg.\" While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the helicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the waist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was. Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred pounds on Earth, close to six hundred here. Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's shoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the cabin was crowded. \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked. \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\" Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly. \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr. \"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to Harriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might ask him to tell you about it.\" Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that worried Asa. \"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In another minute the helicopter was in the sky."}

{"chunk_id": "MUCK_MAN_6#0", "contents": "A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty minutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement. After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return for the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg approximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the egg any time with some other muck man to dig for it. Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio. \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you coming?\" There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave. If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him all along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an egg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he would be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from which he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip. There were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his way. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they lost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help. What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at night. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in this strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone.... A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm. Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed helicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming back alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the carcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it. No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big machine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to hover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside, the landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter flipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into the mud. Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe passage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the extra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose of the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the controls to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne. IV \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady herself as she climbed out of the machine. \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun. From the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty soon.\" \"What happened?\" \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of the settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you.

He said anyone who talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\" She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter. \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said. \"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\" Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He eyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort it would make. \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here and we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me to Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was here was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and there seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run things to suit myself and he walked off.\" She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things. \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could hardly believe it yet. \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used to this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up straight?\" Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of the plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in the mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held it with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up. \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if that problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle the machine-gun.\" \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before we could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought while she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men who went out today?\" he asked. \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of them may not have got back yet.\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This guard smelled trouble and it could be counted on to come—for a nose for trouble was one of the many talents bred here! I His name was Liam O'Leary and there was something stinking in his nostrils. It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble was yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of guards in Estates-General Correctional Institution—better known to its inmates as the Jug—and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent of trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to reach his captaincy. And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R. He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like her into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she couldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in. He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\" The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block guard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\" O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the Civil Service Guide to Prison Administration : \"Detainees will be permitted to speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary was a man who lived by the book. She burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told me I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush up, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and told them I refused to mop.\" The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk—that's what she was telling you to do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is—\" \"Shut up, Sodaro.\""}
{"chunk_id": "My_Lady_Greensleeves_2#0", "contents": "Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was attractive and young—not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off to a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the disciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and looked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for him to judge their cases. He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your cell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you should have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time—\" \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first offense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in the mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The block guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench, and she claimed the same business—said she didn't understand when the other one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard warned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\" Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I don't care. I don't care!\" O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\" It was the only thing to do—for her own sake as much as for his. He had managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted to say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up forever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was clearly the next step for her. All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet to Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here. What's she in for?\" \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her, Cap'n. She's a figger-lover!\" Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked \"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the smell from his nose. What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty business? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the yard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage—decent Civil Service parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If anything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and look what she had made of it. The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no exception, but with the difference that his is the one species that creates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment that clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons made by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the ceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.

From the moment that clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons made by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the ceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame. Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From the born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved to the point of smaller contact and less communication between the specializations, until now they could understand each other on only the most basic physical necessities—and not even always then. But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree of civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation of each specialization—social and genetic measures to make them breed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man, or at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the specializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer or Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized, would be good at no specialization. And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups are the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal enforcement of a demonstrable fact. \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and touched his cap as O'Leary passed by. \"Evening.\""}
{"chunk_id": "My_Lady_Greensleeves_3#0", "contents": "O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those things, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd noticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to sweep—the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the cobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's job to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they didn't. There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a perfectly good civil-service position—better than post-office clerk, not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He was proud of it. It was right that he should be proud of it. He was civil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to do a good, clean civil-service job. If he had happened to be born a fig—a clerk , he corrected himself—if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been proud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk—or a mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter. Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe, but they had a—well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary was a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a touch of envy how comfortable it must be to be a wipe—a laborer . No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and loaf, work and loaf. Of course, he wouldn't really want that kind of life, because he was Civil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that weren't meant to be— \"Evening, Cap'n.\" He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of maintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate. \"Evening, Conan,\" he said. Conan, now—he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the next hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on the prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the cars going—and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up in another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status restored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he certainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as Civil Service or anything else. He knew his place. So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers? II Every prison has its Greensleeves—sometimes they are called by different names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State called it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the snake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what it is called; it is a place for punishment.

And punishment is what you get. Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the disciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its inhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of its own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And like any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them. Their names were Sauer and Flock. Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She was in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an irritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor below, when she heard the yelling. \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and \"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other. The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck guard. The outside guard looked impassively back—after all, he was on the outside. The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\" The outside guard shrugged. \"Detail, halt !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as the three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the head of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care of 'em, will you? Especially the lady—she's going to like it here, because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her company.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O guards. The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary knows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all riled up.\" \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up already.\" Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no attention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block corridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you could ignore the prisoners—they simply could not move fast enough, against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a rule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all the time—only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's restraining garment removed. Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate—and fell flat on her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was like walking through molasses. The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy, auntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right direction and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot. \"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it"}

Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules say you got to wear it and the rules—Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his head, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry in the Greensleeves. However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from tears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge to retch."}
{"chunk_id": "My_Lady_Greensleeves_4#0", "contents": "Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were laborers—\"wipes,\" for short—or, at any rate, they had been once. They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even for them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big, grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe five-footer with the build of a water moccasin—and the sad, stupid eyes of a calf. Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\" \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell. \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so as not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal laughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble, Flock!\" \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that, Sauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\" The howling started all over again. The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off the tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take a turn in here for a while?\" \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head. \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I don't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat your head off!\" \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he grinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know you can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\" \"Shut up !\" yelled the inside guard. Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help it. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting under her skin. They weren't even—even human , she told herself miserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the satisfaction of hearing her—they were animals! Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly that resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly normal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against the vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was good that Sauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious system— But did they have to scream so? The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to weeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless! It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless, because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very long. III \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden. \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life. \"Trouble?

This afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\" The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what did you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball in the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\" \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the outside—an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes don't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\" O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that it didn't smell right? \"For instance—Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's a pretty good old girl—that's why she's the block orderly. She's a lifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women. But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she told Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now Mathias wouldn't—\" The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about that kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a desk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped a pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the scalding heat. He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured. \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have your job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is just as important as my job,\" he said piously. \" Everybody's job is just as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to our own jobs. We don't want to try to pass .\" O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was that for the warden to talk to him? \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean, after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was a great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \" You know you don't want to worry about my end of running the prison. And I don't want to worry about yours . You see?\" And he folded his hands and smiled like a civil-service Buddha."}

I smell the signs.\" \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last. \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose—\" \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with all your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee, made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not noticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into it this time. He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect. \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you tonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the—' Oh, curse the thing.\" His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably. That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary; they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge. \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What the devil do you want? Don't you know I'm—What? You did what ? You're going to WHAT?\" He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror. Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like clamshells in a steamer. \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\" And he hung up—more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his fingers. The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O. Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it didn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good. Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the hard-timers of the Greensleeves. His name was Flock. He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him, thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the crazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the face of an agonized man. The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\" Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison rules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the Greensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment. \"Rest period\" it was called—in the rule book. The inmates had a less lovely term for it."}

{"chunk_id": "My_Lady_Greensleeves_6#0", "contents": "At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet. Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat bed—nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields had a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out. Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed the backs of her thighs gingerly—and slowly, slowly, for the eddy currents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against rubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance. The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She proudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds. He didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while she attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male prisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was grateful. At least she didn't have to live quite like a fig—like an underprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken. Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an asbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove. Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over. The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe. Couldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real enough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I—I—\" \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around Flock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in here, he told himself—not for the first time. And imagine, some people didn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he realized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning. Almost like meat scorching. It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the stinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to get all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if he didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was pretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little vain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability to make the rounds in two minutes, every time. Every time but this. For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close. The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was Flock—astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't been in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there was something that glinted and smoked. \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut with pain. But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining, smoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though it had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God knows"}

It looked as though it had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God knows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how—filed, filed to sharpness over endless hours. No wonder Flock moaned—the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly cooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv had been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid. \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get hurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell him not to, you hear?\" He was nearly fainting with the pain. But he hadn't let go. He didn't let go. And he didn't stop. IV It was Flock on the phone to the warden—Flock with his eyes still streaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing the two bound deck guards. Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the voice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and hating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt himself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the guards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got your guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\" And he snapped the connection. O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\" The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated, and picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison operator: \"Get me the governor—fast.\" Riot! The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots. It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority with his manager and their wives—and just when he was holding the Porkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole. It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field to the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a Red Alert that was real. It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway checkpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the nineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug. Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved. A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in every limb and class.

Riot! And not merely a street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers relaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the corrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes and no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together."}
{"chunk_id": "My_Lady_Greensleeves_7#0", "contents": "Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The airmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of the alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched and yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained and their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled for tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids couldn't get up yet—it was the middle of the night. And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers struggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing area to hear. They caught the words from a distance—not quite correctly. \"Riot!\" gasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I told Charlie they'd get out of hand and—Alys, we aren't safe. You know how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club and stand right by the door and—\" \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children querulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the use of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd better come along to Supply with me and draw a gun—you'll need it before this night is over.\" But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the scramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of trouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called them out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such levels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison. The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a whistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they were the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up their picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers in each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below. They were ready for the breakout. But there wasn't any breakout. The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The helicopters hung on—still ready, still waiting. The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again. They stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed. The prison below them was washed with light—from the guard posts on the walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of the guard squadrons surrounding the walls. North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed land, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed lights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion from their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded tenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to window; and there were crowds in the bright streets. \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier yelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the whirling blades. \"Look"}

The first breakout from the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be right in the middle of it!\" He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it—for every man, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of it. There was no place anywhere that would be spared. No mixing. That was the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in a family fight—and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers a clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties than blood or skin? But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and once they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The breakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever known. But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to come."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Finding a cause worth dying for is no great trick—the Universe is full of them. Finding one worth living for is the genuine problem! In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of a star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood counting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any significance in the number. He had no idea. \"What do you make of it?\" he asked. Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to scratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit. \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all built out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways, maybe?\" Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered stone jutted out of the sand before him. \"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out. \"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's not another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it much of a civilization.\" \"You don't think these are native?\" Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded. Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great age. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old— too old. He reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone ridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed that the buildings had no airlocks. Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\" Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\" \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These things are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And you can see that the rock itself is native—\" he indicated the ledge beneath their feet—\"and was cut out a long while back.\" \"How long?\" Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\" \"Make a rough estimate.\" Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled wryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\" Steffens whistled. Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell from that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind at least several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a fraction of that force.\" The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in interstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first uncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was an historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history. Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built these had been in space for thousands of years.

{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_2#0", "contents": "While the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens remained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly at the walls. \"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\" \"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was roaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears at each other, that long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from Varius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these get to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\" He kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they now? A race with several thousand years....\" \"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added: \"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\" Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized now how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him. \"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last? There's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need to build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left something behind. The only reason they would need a camp would be—\" \"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\" Steffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it go?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black midday sky. \"We'll never know.\" \"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked. \"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The third planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but it has a CO 2 atmosphere.\" \"How about moons?\" Steffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_3#0", "contents": "The third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close, and then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly, in places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the clouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the misty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight zone. The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a hot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors had detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing, but he had to try. At a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning, moving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark outlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below. Steffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently. After a while he saw a city. The main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and they stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when he saw that the city was dead. He looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces rising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center of the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in diameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved. Steffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and headed out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun. The rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then there were more cities—all with the black depression, the circular stamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing. No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for there had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred years. The ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were down below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became apparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive. After a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends from the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\" Steffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around to the daylight side. \"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the radiation suits.\" He paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to this world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one of the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then, thousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was that Ball's question be answered.

When the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens was still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move. Down far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved. Steffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot. Tiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding down the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second, saw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and then the hill was past."}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_4#0", "contents": "Quickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and blasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck. Steffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the ship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding group, all matched with bunches of hanging arms. Nothing alive but robots, he thought, robots . He adjusted to full close up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen. Behind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement. A band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head—it would be the eye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a single round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined, he realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now almost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of the trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the most perfect robots he had ever seen. The ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight of the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the alert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He tried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do. The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden under any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race? The Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The building of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any rate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already. While Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first time in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly. From the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the sudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise. \"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\" \"They were.\" Ball stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion of dots in the mist. \"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\" Ball was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly at Steffens. \"Well, what do we do now?\" Steffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite possibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and see if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\" \" Can we go down?\" \"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot constitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his fingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all. They could be the natives.\" Ball gulped. \"I don't follow you.\" \"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet—the brains of them, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added, \"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\" Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from"}

Anyway,\" he added, \"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\" Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the screen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking. The Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed to do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of human colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very clearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty. And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him, that the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and gone. He stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought opened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an outpost? An outpost! He turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was lost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and stirred up trouble.... The thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away. A voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say: \" Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our desire is only to serve.... \""}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_5#0", "contents": "\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously through shocked lips. Everyone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens was not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices. \"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is only to serve.\" And then the robots sent a picture . As perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took shape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone against a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots. With slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the hanging arms of its side, of its right side, and extended it toward Steffens, a graciously offered hand. Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized right away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The robot mind had helped. When the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He waited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of the robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if they wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more happened, he began to lose his fear. While the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back. He concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good measure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking hands. \"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what they had said, and explained: \"We have come from the stars.\" It was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered baffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order someone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and think a message? No, it was his responsibility; he had to go on: \"We request—we respectfully request permission to land upon your planet.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_6#0", "contents": "Steffens had not realized that there were so many. They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there were hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving even as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with fantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety. Most of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal. Others threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none touched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out. One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now saw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black thing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture. Steffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through the glove of his suit. \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now Steffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was less friendly now, less—Steffens could not understand—somehow less interested , as if the robot had been—expecting someone else. \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission to land.\" \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\" Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He tried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they should seem inhuman. But.... \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically. Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above, jets throbbing gently. \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his mind, there was no need to ask. For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense and uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was obviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men to come on out of the skiff. They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard the one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly. \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is our—custom—not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we observed that you were in ignorance of our real—nature—and were about to leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you might base your decision upon sufficient data.\" Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action. \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete access to your mind, and would perhaps be—dismayed—to learn that we have been gathering information from you. We must—apologize. Our only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only that information was taken which is necessary for communication and—understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your request.\" Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed as violently"}

We will enter your minds henceforth only at your request.\" Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed as violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he retreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work. The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way different from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens guessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The picture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen, had probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and the others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary lapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed almost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to examine the first robot in detail. It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen. The most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of the head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the metal chest. Symbols in row upon row—numbers, perhaps—were upon the chest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued in orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the base of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was a remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on the nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude that the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at that, although the answer seemed illogical. It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the symbols again. And only then did he realized what they were."}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_7#0", "contents": "After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the ship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met by the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of the robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them stood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun like a vast, metallic field of black wheat. The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to feel their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless faces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were still reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had built them well. Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear plastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out from the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak had remained with Steffens. Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball was for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and talking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the bare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died. It was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their very lines which was pleasant and relaxing. Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too. \"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if the robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever heard of a robot being glad?\" Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope you will forgive us our curiosity, but—yours is a remarkable race. We have never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said haltingly, but it was the best he could do. The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head. \"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you. Your question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am not exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to convey—I would have to examine your thought more fully—but I believe that there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\" The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was disconcerted. \"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are—curious.\" It stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend. Steffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length: \"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely metallic, and that of the Makers , which would appear to be somewhat more like yours. I am not a—doctor—and therefore cannot acquaint you with the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are interested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be of assistance.\" It was Steffens' turn to struggle,"}

It will be glad to be of assistance.\" It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while Ball and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously, were whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\" Steffens decided, were probably just that—doctor-robots, designed specifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers. The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question he had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush: \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\" Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't really be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke with difficulty. \"The Makers—are not here.\" Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and went on: \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\" Could that be pain in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the spectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind. War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been killed. He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the midst of a radiation so lethal that nothing , nothing could live; robots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp. If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as well, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the free oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere—good God, how old were the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots, then out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black wheat. Steffens felt a deep chill. Were they immortal?"}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_8#0", "contents": "\"Would you like to see a doctor?\" Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot was referring. \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots continued waiting patiently. \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\" \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the calculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of age, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\" Steffens tried to understand that. \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if you were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the first—letters—of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\" \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled. \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added, pointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of—Peb—is seventeen years, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some thirty-eight years.\" Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about fifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot, Elb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen and plant life would have been needed. Unless— He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV. Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all. His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order. \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked. Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as if the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering. \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the—\" another pause for a word—\"by the Factory .\" \"The Factory?\" \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\" Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly. \"Would you prefer to use your—skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\" It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went along with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other side of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of dusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in a valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling in the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved outside the thing, little black bugs in the distance—moving around their birthplace."}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_9#0", "contents": "The Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was usually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon team roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the strangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those buildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have to be cleared up before they could leave. Surprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came near a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling that it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots that he did little thinking. Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as unusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great shock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a bug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors knew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by the words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize that the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and it was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were needed. But when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing. At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen could remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And one morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover that hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively decontaminated the entire area. It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were. He learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million. The great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the ship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive. Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind. The robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held, pondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to the other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the mind of a thing that had never known life. He had a vague idea of the robot's history—more, perhaps, then they knew themselves—but he refrained from forming an opinion until Aliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing philosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had."}
{"chunk_id": "Orphans_of_the_Void_10#0", "contents": "\"What do you do ?\" Steffens asked. Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very little. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at birth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that knowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural sciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is to serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much more fit to serve when the Makers return.\" \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the robots expected the Makers to do so. Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had surmised that the Makers were not coming back.\" If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then. But it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic. \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else would we have been built?\" Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to Elb, was no question at all. Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have known—that the Makers were gone and would never come back—he was a long time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the back of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a faith. But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the structure of human society, and the robot—a machine which did not eat or sleep—listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens mentioned God. \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\" Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered: \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you were the Makers returning—\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the seeming disappointment he had sensed—\"but then we probed your minds and found that you were not, that you were another kind of being, unlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even—\" Elb caught himself—\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled over who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology, but it seemed to have a peculiar—\" Elb paused for a long while—\"an untouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\" Steffens understood. He nodded. The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The Makers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them who made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God. It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself. But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled."}

SMITH Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction May 1958. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The girl was tall, wide-eyed and brunette. She had the right curves in the right places and would have been beautiful if her nose had been smaller, if her mouth had been larger and if her hair had been wavy instead of straight. \"Hank said you wanted to see me,\" she said when she stopped beside Joe's table. \"Yeah.\" Joe nodded at the other chair. \"Have a seat.\" He reached into a pocket, withdrew five ten-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"I want you to do a job for me. It'll only take a few minutes.\" The girl counted the money, then placed it in her purse. Joe noticed a small counterfeit-detector inside the purse before she closed it. \"What's the job?\" \"Tell you later.\" He gulped the remainder of his drink, almost pouring it down his throat. \"Hey. You trying to make yourself sick?\" \"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to get drunk all afternoon.\" As the liquor settled in his stomach, he waited for the warm glow. But the glow didn't come ... the bartender had watered his drink again. \"Trying to get drunk?\" the girl inquired. \"Are you crazy?\" \"No. It's simple. If I get drunk, I can join the AAA and get free room and board for a month while they give me a treatment.\" It was easy enough to understand, he reflected, but a lot harder to do. The CPA robot bartenders saw to it that anyone got high if they wanted, but comparatively few got drunk. Each bartender could not only mix drinks but could also judge by a man's actions and speech when he was on the verge of drunkenness. At the proper time—since drunkenness was illegal—a bartender always watered the drinks. Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but had always failed. And in all of New York's millions, there had been only a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year. The girl laughed. \"If you're that hard up, I don't know if I should take this fifty or not. Why don't you go out and get a job like everyone else?\" As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she saw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies."}

{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_2#0", "contents": "When she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to pieces. He'd done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to get another—everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and show it upon request. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I didn't know you were a DCT.\" \"And who'll hire a guy with criminal tendencies? You know the score. When you try to get a job, they ask to see your ID before they even tell you if there's an opening or not. If your CPA ID says you're a DCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've had several jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man, street-cleaner, ditch-digger—\" On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor. Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned across the table and whispered in the girl's ear, \"That's what I want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get convicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!\" The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. \"Say! You really got big plans, don't you?\" He smiled at her admiration. It was something big to plan a crime. A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting, blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA—Crime Prevention Association. There were no longer any prisons—CPA officials had declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent crime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of ingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime almost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts. No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill someone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he wasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city could afford the CPA hospitals. The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because it did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with prisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons. And, ironically, a man who did commit a crime was a sort of hero. He was a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses to kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a hero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was—when he left one of the CPA hospitals—a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a man who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.

She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped her blouse and skirt. He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away, her body poised like a wrestler's. \"What's the big idea?\" \"Scream,\" Joe said. \"Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\" The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the intended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., were not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't complete the act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that the CPA had once again functioned properly. The girl shook her head vigorously. \"Sorry, buddy. Can't help you that way. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?\" \"What's the matter?\" Joe complained. \"I'm not asking you to do anything wrong.\" \"You stupid jerk. What do you think this is—the Middle Ages? Don't you know almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant in the WSDA!\" Joe groaned. The WSDA—Women's Self-Defense Association—a branch of the CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even developed new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in those new techniques. The girl was still shaking her head. \"Can't do it, buddy. I'd lose my rank if you were convicted of—\" \"Do I have to make you scream?\" Joe inquired tiredly and advanced toward the girl. \"—and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey! Stop it! \" Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when she said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body, and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air. The alley's concrete floor was hard—it had always been hard, but he became acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it. There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful stars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police sirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closed in on him."}
{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_4#0", "contents": "When he awoke, a rough voice was saying, \"Okay. Snap out of it.\" He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner's office. It would be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture except for a desk and chairs, but the walls were lined with the controls of television screens, electronic calculators and a hundred other machines that formed New York's mechanical police force. Commissioner Hendricks was a remarkable character. There was something wrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with bushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something of his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate hadn't made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men to high political positions were women. Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly, likable person. But the millions of women voters who saw his face on posters and on their TV screens saw only the ugly face and heard only the harsh voice. The President of the United States was a capable man, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked something like a bulldog had been elected as New York's police commissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters. \"Where's the girl?\" Joe asked. \"I processed her while you were out cold. She left. Joe, you—\" \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"I'll save you the trouble. I admit it. Attempted rape. I confess.\" Hendricks smiled. \"Sorry, Joe. You missed the boat again.\" He reached out and turned a dial on his desk top. \"We had a microphone hidden in that alley. We have a lot of microphones hidden in a lot of alleys. You'd be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in alleys!\" Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of machines on the walls, \" Scream. Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you. \" And then the girl's voice, \" Sorry, buddy. Can't help— \" He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\""}
{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_5#0", "contents": "Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was slouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\" Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime. Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly once again. That meant the CPA had once again prevented crime, and the CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt to prevent crimes by punishment. If it did, that would be a violation of the New Civil Rights. Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared. When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before. And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a DCT First Class. \"You've graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do you? Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know what that means?\" Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face. \"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers. You'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it works? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe Harper.' So they look up your record—amateur cops always keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks—and they see that you stop frequently at Walt's Tavern. \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not to let you know they're watching you. They watch you all night, just hoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone, so they can be the first ones to yell ' Police! ' They'll watch you because it's exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever did prevent you from committing a crime, they'd get a nice reward and they'd be famous.\" \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl—\" Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is interesting. You see, it doesn't stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's thousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from reading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because it's rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down the street, there'll be at least a dozen of 'em following you, and no matter where you go, you can bet there'll be some of 'em sitting next to you, standing next to you. \"During the day, they'll take your picture with their spy cameras that look like buttons on their coats.

They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard boxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you through restaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you in public rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes while they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look back, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a block behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until the day you die, because you're a freak!\" Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced the floor. \"And it doesn't end there , Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be the object of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop you on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'll ask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were a child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First Class?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and—\" \"Okay, goddam it! Stop it! \" Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief and lit a cigarette. \"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're too dumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime and criminals ... to hate them as nothing has ever been hated before. Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell if you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town where there aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or—\" Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \" Favor , did you say? The day you do me a favor—\" Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I want to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read books. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\" \"I couldn't leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I'm flat broke. Thanks to your CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.\""}

You can sign an IOU and pay me back a little at a time.\" Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me—any crime.\" \"Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is a violation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\" \"Umm.\" \"Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't have to be a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your criminal tendencies and—\" \"Go to those head-shrinkers ?\" Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\" Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you make me go?\" \"Violation of Civil Rights.\" \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same thing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\" \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book. \"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New York who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people who aren't protected properly—blind spots in our protection devices. As soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices, but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done. \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can I do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe, pick a name and go out and rob him.'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did that, I'd be committing a crime myself!\" He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket again and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of thirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.\" Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the big man. Hendricks was—unbelievably—offering him a victim, offering him a crime! Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and address and memorized it: John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St. When Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\" \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.\""}
{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_8#0", "contents": "When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake. Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went. Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator. If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they were discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received, the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in someone's pocket at forty yards. Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place of business for years. Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors—devices placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing poison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount of it would kill a human. The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the supervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think of kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was pointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place of business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors that could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain. And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance of the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled that he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were different: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and their aim was infallible."}

With the huge atomic power plants scattered across the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of the devices had cost even less. And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH. If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH. It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things. Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment 204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine. The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204, he could see that the wall on either side of it was new . That is, instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but evidently he didn't want to pay for installation. When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to close the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day. Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it."}

The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run, but—perfection itself—engraved on the back was the inscription, To John with Love . His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed. Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \" Thief! Police! Help! \" He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him; cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence. When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning."}

You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.\" As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference. During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in himself. He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an after-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months and he had, between operations, been locked in his room. Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back. Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change: Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now, even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred. They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it altogether. \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks. Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks, cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day. But now—another change in him— He put the emotion into words: \"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I don't.\" \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded like a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You stupid—\" He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think those people are down there because they admire what you did? They're down there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're glad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're an ex -criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get your autograph.\" Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did understand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, what was he ?"}

{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_12#0", "contents": "It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered some more. Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired old lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a watch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total confusion. What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an ex-murderer came out. In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled himself with the thought, People are funny. Who can understand 'em? Feeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward Hendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'll be able to get a good job now.\" \"That's why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to explain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're spectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and I don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did you a favor.\" Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it! \"You robbed Gralewski's apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA employee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays the rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places like that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you before they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First Class won't take the free psycho treatment or—\" \"Well, it's still a favor.\" Hendricks' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if you stumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for your type of case. Anyone can—free of charge—have treatment by the best psychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the treatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commit a crime, get caught and be a hero ... an Ex .\""}

{"chunk_id": "PICK_A_CRIME_13#0", "contents": "The car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages were laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA psychologists to relieve tension. And—despite the treatment, Joe shuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly watching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies, it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it wanted you to be. \"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks continued. \"You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it. You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked before in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in your head is going to say, Work! Work! Exes always get good jobs because employers know they're good workers. \"But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Ex is like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all the criminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best thing—you'll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might want to break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you an illustration....\" Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of names. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in his arm froze before it moved it an inch. And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so intense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in agony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head, Unlawful to strike someone except in self-defense . He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him, the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain returned, and the mental voice whispered, Unlawful to curse . He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a crime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tell the whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon as that decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and the voice, Unlawful to divulge CPA procedure . \"See what I mean?\" Hendricks asked. \"A century ago, you would have been locked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you until the day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, a useful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got a big hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every time you get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until you learn.

The CPA was everywhere, only now it was also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he wanted to do and now .... Hendricks laughed. \"You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean, wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people.

He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated him back.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Being two men rolled out of one would solve my problems—but which one would I be? I suppose that every guy reaches a point once in his lifetime when he gets one hundred and forty per cent fed up with his wife. Understand now—I've got nothing against marriage or any thing like that. Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded American Institution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throw a cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a woman like Marge— It's so permanent . Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in the Blissful 'Fifties—but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968, and all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got their teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved Spouse Compensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life if I'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved. You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a man has to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime. So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keep Marge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long. Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes and a shape that could set your teeth chattering—but that was where the dream stopped. She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long enough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was crying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling detail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband, which happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly headache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half she was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we got along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case."}
{"chunk_id": "PRIME_DIFFERENCE_2#0", "contents": "Maybe we just weren't meant for each other. I don't know. I used to envy guys like Harry Folsom at the office. His wife is no joy to live with either, but at least he could take a spin down to Rio once in a while with one of the stenographers and get away with it. I knew better than to try. Marge was already so jealous that I couldn't even smile at the company receptionist without a twinge of guilt. Give Marge something real to howl about, and I'd be ready for the Rehab Center in a week. But I'd underestimated Marge. She didn't need anything real, as I found out when Jeree came along. Business was booming and the secretaries at the office got shuffled around from time to time. Since I had an executive-type job, I got an executive-type secretary. Her name was Jeree and she was gorgeous. As a matter of fact, she was better than gorgeous. She was the sort of secretary every businessman ought to have in his office. Not to do any work—just to sit there. Jeree was tall and dark, and she could convey more without saying anything than I ever dreamed was possible. The first day she was there, she conveyed to me very clearly that if I cared to supply the opportunity, she'd be glad to supply the motive. That night, I could tell that Marge had been thinking something over during the day. She let me get the first bite of dinner halfway to my mouth, and then she said, \"I hear you got a new secretary today.\" I muttered something into my coffee cup and pretended not to hear. Marge turned on her Accusing Look #7. \"I also hear that she's five-foot-eight and tapes out at 38-25-36 and thinks you're handsome.\" Marge had quite a spy system. \"She couldn't be much of a secretary,\" she added. \"She's a perfectly good secretary,\" I blurted, and kicked myself mentally. I should have known Marge's traps by then. Marge exploded. I didn't get any supper, and she was still going strong at midnight. I tried to argue, but when Marge got going, there was no stopping her. I had my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned. Harry Folsom administered the coup de grace at coffee next morning. \"What you need is an Ego Prime,\" he said with a grin. \"Solve all your problems. I hear they work like a charm.\" I set my coffee cup down. Bells were ringing in my ears. \"Don't be ridiculous. It's against the law. Anyway, I wouldn't think of such a thing. It's—it's indecent.\" Harry shrugged. \"Just joking, old man, just joking. Still, it's fun to think about, eh? Freedom from wife. Absolutely safe and harmless. Not even too expensive, if you've got the right contacts. And I've got a friend who knows a guy—\" Just then, Jeree walked past us and flashed me a big smile.

The wonder was that Ego Prime, Inc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the nation's housewives got wind of just what their product was. From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the use of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license for a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a high public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even then his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to have a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance exactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how, why, and under what circumstances. The law didn't leave a man much leeway. But everybody knew that if you really wanted a personal Prime with all his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black market prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be done. Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got lost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with a black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse off lower Broadway. \"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth. We've been expecting you.\""}

I understand. It might be possible.\" He fingered his mustache and regarded me from pouchy eyes. \"Busy executives often come to us to avoid the—ah—unpleasantness of formal arrangements. Naturally, we only act as agents, you might say. We never see the merchandise ourselves—\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"Now were you interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?\" I assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back door for Utility models. \"Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful workmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practically complete circuit duplication. Very useful for—ah—close contact work, you know. Social engagements, conferences—\" I was shaking my head. \"I want a Super Deluxe model,\" I told him. He grinned and winked. \"Ah, indeed! You want perfect duplication. Yes, indeed. Domestic situations can be—awkward, shall we say. Very awkward—\" I gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems were any affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom. \"We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement. You'll go to our laboratory on 14th Street to have the minute impressions taken. But I can assure you you'll be delighted, simply delighted.\" The blanks weren't very impressive—clay and putty and steel, faceless, brainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of all sorts. He was thorough—embarrassingly thorough, in fact—but finally he was finished. I went on to the laboratory. And that was all there was to it."}

Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it once he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought him body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design, artistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with the modern Ego Primes we have today. I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked outside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty woozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the recovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime when I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked in, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a tired look on his face. \"Meet George Faircloth Prime,\" the technician said, grinning at me like a nursing mother. I shook hands with myself. Good firm handshake, I thought admiringly. Nothing flabby about it. I slapped George Prime on the shoulder happily. \"Come on, Brother,\" I said. \"You've got a job to do.\" But, secretly, I was wondering what Jeree was doing that night. George Prime had remote controls, as well as a completely recorded neurological analogue of his boss, who was me. George Prime thought what I thought about the same things I did in the same way I did. The only difference was that what I told George Prime to do, George Prime did. If I told him to go to a business conference in San Francisco and make the smallest possible concessions for the largest possible orders, he would go there and do precisely that. His signature would be my signature. It would hold up in court. And if I told him that my wife Marge was really a sweet, good-hearted girl and that he was to stay home and keep her quiet and happy any time I chose, he'd do that, too. George Prime was a duplicate of me right down to the sandy hairs on the back of my hands. Our fingerprints were the same. We had the same mannerisms and used the same figures of speech. The only physical difference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression buried in the hair above his ear. A little pressure there would stop George Prime dead in his tracks. He was so lifelike, even I kept forgetting that he was basically just a pile of gears. I'd planned very carefully how I meant to use him, of course. Every man who's been married eight years has a sanctuary. He builds it up and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's natural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things. Sometimes it takes him years of diligent work to establish his hideout and be confident that it will stay inviolate, but if he starts early enough, and sticks with it long enough, and is fierce enough and persistent enough and crafty"}

With me, it was the whole workshop in the garage."}
{"chunk_id": "PRIME_DIFFERENCE_6#0", "contents": "At first, Marge tried open warfare. She had to clean the place up, she said. I told her I didn't want her to clean it up. She could clean the whole house as often as she chose, but I would clean up the workshop. After a couple of sharp engagements on that field, Marge staged a strategic withdrawal and reorganized her attack. A little pile of wood shavings would be on the workshop floor one night and be gone the next. A wrench would be back on the rack—upside down, of course. An open paint can would have a cover on it. I always knew. I screamed loudly and bitterly. I ranted and raved. I swore I'd rig up a booby-trap with a shotgun. So she quit trying to clean in there and just went in once in a while to take a look around. I fixed that with the old toothpick-in-the-door routine. Every time she so much as set foot in that workshop, she had a battle on her hands for the next week or so. She could count on it. It was that predictable. She never found out how I knew, and after seven years or so, it wore her down. She didn't go into the workshop any more. As I said, you've got to be persistent, but you'll win. Eventually. If you're really persistent. Now all my effort paid off. I got Marge out of the house for an hour or two that day and had George Prime delivered and stored in the big closet in the workshop. They hooked his controls up and left me a manual of instructions for running him. When I got home that night, there he was, just waiting to be put to work. After supper, I went out to the workshop—to get the pipe I'd left there, I said. I pushed George Prime's button, winked at him and switched on the free-behavior circuits. \"Go to it, Brother,\" I said. George Prime put my pipe in his mouth, lit it and walked back into the house. Five minutes later, I heard them fighting. It sounded so familiar that I laughed out loud. Then I caught a cab on the corner and headed uptown. We had quite a night, Jeree and I. I got home just about time to start for work, and sure enough, there was George Prime starting my car, business suit on, briefcase under his arm. I pushed the recall and George Prime got out of the car and walked into the workshop. He stepped into his cradle in the closet. I turned him off and then drove away in the car. Bless his metallic soul, he'd even kissed Marge good-by for me!"}

For the first week, I was hardly home at all. I must say I felt a little guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all the time—he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that he literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same whenever I took him out of his closet. \"She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,\" I'd say. \"You'll learn to like her after a bit.\" \"Of course I like her,\" George Prime said. \"You told me to, didn't you? Stop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.\" He sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. \"You're sure you understand the exchange mechanism?\" I asked. I didn't want any foul-ups there, as you can imagine. \"Perfectly,\" said George Prime. \"When you buzz the recall, I wait for the first logical opportunity I can find to come out to the workshop, and you take over.\" \"But you might get nervous. You might inadvertently tip her off.\" George Prime looked pained. \"Really, old man! I'm a Super Deluxe model, remember? I don't have fourteen activated Hunyadi tubes up in this cranial vault of mine just for nothing. You're the one that's nervous. I'll take care of everything. Relax.\" So I did. Jeree made good all her tacit promises and then some. She had a very cozy little apartment on 34th Street where we went to relax after a hard day at the office. When we weren't doing the town, that is. As long as Jeree didn't try too much conversation, everything was wonderful. And then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the accounting department. Or Dorothy in promotion. Or Jane. Or Ingrid. I could go on at some length, but I won't. I was building quite a reputation for myself around the office. Of course, it was like buying your first 3-V set. In a week or so, the novelty wears off a little and you start eating on schedule again. It took a little while, but I finally had things down to a reasonable program. Tuesday and Thursday nights, I was informally \"out\" while formally \"in.\" Sometimes I took Sunday nights \"out\" if things got too sticky around the house over the weekend. The rest of the time, George Prime cooled his heels in his closet. Locked up, of course. Can't completely trust a wife to observe a taboo, no matter how well trained she is. There, was an irreconcilable amount of risk. George Prime had to quick-step some questions about my work at the office—there was no way to supply him with current data until the time for his regular two-month refill and pattern-accommodation at the laboratory. In the meantime, George Prime had to make do with what he had. But as he himself pointed out he was a Super Deluxe model."}

I didn't notice anything at first—I was hardly ever home. But one night I found my pipe and slippers laid out for me, and the evening paper neatly folded on my chair, and it brought me up short. Marge had been extremely docile lately. We hadn't had a good fight in days. Weeks, come to think of it. I thought it over and shrugged. Old age, I figured. She was bound to mellow sometime. But pretty soon I began to wonder if she wasn't mellowing a little too much. One night when I got home, she kissed me almost as though she really meant it. There wasn't an unpleasant word all through dinner, which happened to be steak with mushrooms, served in the dining room (!) by candlelight (!!) with dinner music that Marge could never bear, chiefly because I liked it. We sat over coffee and cigarettes, and it seemed almost like old times. Very old times, in fact I even caught myself looking at Marge again—really looking at her, watching the light catch in her hair, almost admiring the sparkle in her brown eyes. Sparkle, I said, not glint. As I mentioned before, Marge was always easy to look at. That night, she was practically ravishing. \"What are you doing to her?\" I asked George Prime later, out in the workshop. \"Why, nothing,\" said George Prime, looking innocent. He couldn't fool me with his look, though, because it was exactly the look I use when I'm guilty and pretending to be innocent. \"There must be something .\" George Prime shrugged. \"Any woman will warm up if you spend enough time telling her all the things she wants to hear and pay all the attention to her that she wants paid to her. That's elemental psychology. I can give you page references.\" I ought to mention that George Prime had a complete set of basic texts run into his circuits, at a slightly additional charge. Never can tell when an odd bit of information will come in useful. \"Well, you must be doing quite a job,\" I said. I'd never managed to warm Marge up much. \"I try,\" said George Prime. \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" I hastened to add, forgetting that a Prime's feelings can't be hurt and that he was only acting like me because it was in character. \"I was just curious.\" \"Of course, George.\" \"I'm really delighted that you're doing so well.\" \"Thank you, George.\" But the next night when I was with Dawn, who happens to be a gorgeous redhead who could put Marge to shame on practically any field of battle except maybe brains, I kept thinking about Marge all evening long, and wondering if things weren't getting just a little out of hand."}

I ducked quickly into an alley and flagged him. \" What are you doing out on the street? \" He gave me my martyred look. \"Just buying some bourbon. You were out.\" \"But you're not supposed to be off the premises—\" \"Marge asked me to come. I couldn't tell her I was sorry, but her husband wouldn't let me, could I?\" \"Well, certainly not—\" \"You want me to keep her happy, don't you? You don't want her to get suspicious.\" \"No, but suppose somebody saw us together! If she ever got a hint—\" \"I'm sorry,\" George Prime said contritely. \"It seemed the right thing to do. You would have done it. At least that's what my judgment center maintained. We had quite an argument.\" \"Well, tell your judgment center to use a little sense,\" I snapped. \"I don't want it to happen again.\" The next night, I stayed home, even though it was Tuesday night. I was beginning to get worried. Of course, I did have complete control—I could snap George Prime off any time I wanted, or even take him in for a complete recircuiting—but it seemed a pity. He was doing such a nice job. Marge was docile as a kitten, even more so than before. She sympathized with my hard day at the office and agreed heartily that the boss, despite all appearances, was in reality a jabbering idiot. After dinner, I suggested a movie, but Marge gave me an odd sort of look and said she thought it would be much nicer to spend the evening at home by the fire. I'd just gotten settled with the paper when she came into the living room and sat down beside me. She was wearing some sort of filmy affair I'd never laid eyes on before, and I caught a whiff of my favorite perfume. \"Georgie?\" she said. \"Uh?\" \"Do you still love me?\" I set the paper down and stared at her. \"How's that? Of course I still—\" \"Well, sometimes you don't act much like it.\" \"Mm. I guess I've—uh—got an awful headache tonight.\" Damn that perfume! \"Oh,\" said Marge. \"In fact, I thought I'd turn in early and get some sleep—\" \"Sleep,\" said Marge. There was no mistaking the disappointment in her voice. Now I knew that things were out of hand. The next evening, I activated George Prime and caught the taxi at the corner, but I called Ruby and broke my date with her. I took in an early movie alone and was back by ten o'clock. I left the cab at the corner and walked quietly up the path toward the garage. Then I stopped. I could see Marge and George Prime through the living room windows.

I could see Marge and George Prime through the living room windows. George Prime was kissing my wife the way I hadn't kissed her in eight long years. It made my hair stand on end. And Marge wasn't exactly fighting him off, either. She was coming back for more. After a little, the lights went off. George Prime was a Super Deluxe model, all right."}
{"chunk_id": "PRIME_DIFFERENCE_10#0", "contents": "I dashed into the workshop and punched the recall button as hard as I could, swearing under my breath. How long had this been going on? I punched the button again, viciously, and waited. George Prime didn't come out. It was plenty cold out in the workshop that night and I didn't sleep a wink. About dawn, out came George Prime, looking like a man with a four-day hangover. Our conversation got down to fundamentals. George Prime kept insisting blandly that, according to my own directions, he was to pick the first logical opportunity to come out when I buzzed, and that was exactly what he'd done. I was furious all the way to work. I'd take care of this nonsense, all right. I'd have George Prime rewired from top to bottom as soon as the laboratory could take him. But I never phoned the laboratory. The bank was calling me when I got to the office. They wanted to know what I planned to do about that check of mine that had just bounced. \"What check?\" I asked. \"The one you wrote to cash yesterday—five hundred dollars—against your regular account, Mr. Faircloth.\" The last I'd looked, I'd had about three thousand dollars in that account. I told the man so rather bluntly. \"Oh, no, sir. That is, you did until last week. But all these checks you've been cashing have emptied the account.\" He flashed the checks on the desk screen. My signature was on every one of them. \"What about my special account?\" I'd learned long before that an account Marge didn't know about was sound rear-guard strategy. \"That's been closed out for two weeks.\" I hadn't written a check against that account for over a year! I glared at the ceiling and tried to think things through. I came up with a horrible thought. Marge had always had her heart set on a trip to Bermuda. Just to get away from it all, she'd say. A second honeymoon. I got a list of travel agencies from the business directory and started down them. The third one I tried had a pleasant tenor voice. \"No, sir, not Mrs. Faircloth. You bought two tickets. One way. Champagne flight to Bermuda.\" \"When?\" I choked out. \"Why, today, as a matter of fact. It leaves Idlewild at eleven o'clock—\" I let him worry about my amnesia and started home fast. I didn't know what they'd given that Prime for circuits, but there was no question now that he was out of control— way out of control. And poor Marge, all worked up for a second honeymoon— Then it struck me. Poor Marge? Poor sucker George! No Prime in his right circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and that meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened before. Couple of nasty court battles I'd read about. And she'd known all about George Prime. For how long?"}

I started to call the police, but caught myself just in time. I couldn't very well complain to the cops that my wife had run off with an android. Worse yet, I could get twenty years for having an illegal Prime wandering around. I sat down and poured myself a stiff drink. My own wife deserting me for a pile of bearings. It was indecent. Then I heard the front door open and there was Marge, her arms full of grocery bundles. \"Why, darling! You're home early!\" I just blinked for a moment. Then I said, \"You're still here!\" \"Of course. Where did you think I'd be?\" \"But I thought—I mean the ticket office—\" She set down the bundles and kissed me and looked up into my eyes, almost smiling, half reproachful. \"You didn't really think I'd go running off with something out of a lab, did you?\" \"Then—you knew?\" \"Certainly I knew, silly. You didn't do a very good job of instructing him, either. You gave him far too much latitude. Let him have ideas of his own and all that. And next thing I knew, he was trying to get me to run off with him to Hawaii or someplace.\" \"Bermuda,\" I said. And then Marge was in my arms, kissing me and snuggling her cheek against my chest. \"Even though he looked like you, I knew he couldn't be,\" she said. \"He was like you, but he wasn't you , darling. And all I ever want is you. I just never appreciated you before....\" I held her close and tried to keep my hands from shaking. George Faircloth, Idiot, I thought. She'd never been more beautiful. \"But what did you do with him?\" \"I sent him back to the factory, naturally. They said they could blot him out and use him over again. But let's not talk about that any more. We've got more interesting things to discuss.\" Maybe we had, but we didn't waste a lot of time talking. It was the Marge I'd once known and I was beginning to wonder how I could have been so wrong about her. In fact unless my memory was getting awfully porous, the old Marge was never like this— I kissed her tenderly and ran my hands through her hair, and felt the depression with my fore-finger, and then I knew what had really happened. That Marge always had been a sly one. I wondered how she was liking things in Bermuda."}

{"chunk_id": "PRIME_DIFFERENCE_12#0", "contents": "Marge probably thought she'd really put me where I belonged, but the laugh was on her, after all. As I said, the old Marge was never like the new one. Marge Prime makes Jeree and Sybil and Dorothy and Dawn and Jane and Ruby all look pretty sad by comparison. She cooks like a dream and she always brings me my pipe and slippers. As they say, there's nothing a man likes more than to be appreciated. A hundred per cent appreciated, with a factory guarantee to correct any slippage, which would only be temporary, anyhow. One of these days, we'll take that second honeymoon. But I think we'll go to Hawaii."}

And there was only a surface rocket in which to escape—with a traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1942. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what I say goes around here. It doesn't happen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits, and I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will be in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat, get this: I'm going to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or no Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because this is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my position, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness. \"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\" Unheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the woman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look, wavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the stare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray almost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it. \"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job, black-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated a precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four nice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water tanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards, allright. I pilot ship. Yes?\" \"No!\" Roberds screamed. Almost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the office froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through the narrow door. \"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me throw this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his chair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly. \"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he blindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night."}
{"chunk_id": "PRISON_PLANET_2#0", "contents": "When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the chair. \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\" \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed door, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there has to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed on a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she dies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital, I'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a jacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and that wasn't meant to be funny!\" Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door. \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought of it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all night tearing them out. We just might be able to hop by dawn ... and hell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\" The nurse came out of the door. \"How is she?\" Roberds asked. \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\" \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look at her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\" \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How long will it take?\" \"Eight days, in that ship.\" Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson was harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship meant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in that untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and Gladney. \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked. \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said. She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean? What is his record?\" Peterson opened his mouth. \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record around here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\" \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He turned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\" Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\" Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was attached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch. And when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the Ganymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL. \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around Centauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps on Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\" \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand?

However, I'll just sum it up in one word: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\" The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation. \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be right to leave Peterson.\" \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base station for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all right.\" Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\" Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind her. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air. \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing him to wear dark glasses!\" Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\" \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled."}

Greaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip her, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the Centaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock. The two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building. On tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\" Roberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat outside. Grease nodded understanding. \"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the wall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away. Swinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a sibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again. \"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat regarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he stepped to the sill. \"Yes?\"—in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning conversation drifted in. \"What you want?\" Nothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot that ship?\" Her voice was shaky. He didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly as he detected it in her words. \"Well, can you?\" she demanded. \"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\" \"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight. And ... well, we want you to pilot it! She refuses to risk Mr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\" Rat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\" Nurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the room, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray explained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please, can you?\" Rat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the window. Almost immediately, he was back again. \"When?\" he whispered. \"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again. Nurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning, she saw him back again. \"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold—hot too. Wrap good!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he disappeared upwards. She ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the time. He'll be back in a moment.\" \"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began wrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window announced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw him out there with arms upstretched. \"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed girl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as she was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again instantly. \"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back soon....\""}

Rat whispered \"Hold tight!\" in her ear and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away in a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on some projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind returned to her throat, and she breathed again. \"I'm sorry,\" she managed to get out, gaspingly. \"I wasn't expecting that. I had forgotten you—\" \"—had wings,\" he finished and chuckled. \"So likewise Greaseball.\" The pale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far horizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain. \"Oh, the bag!\" she gasped. \"I've dropped it.\" He chuckled again. \"Have got. You scare, I catch.\" She didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without warning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock. \"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy.\" But in spite of his warning she tripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to the hammocks. \"Judith?\" she asked. \"Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe.\" \"No talk!\" Rat insisted. \"Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape. You make likewise.\" Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. \"Wrap up tight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!\" And he left her. \"Hey! Where are you going now?\" \"To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!\" His voice floated back. \"Where has he gone?\" Judith called. \"Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we crashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us in. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ... happened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for fear of worrying you.\""}

Wind whistled past the open lock. \"I've caused plenty of trouble haven't I?\" she asked aloud, finally. \"This was certainly a fool stunt, and I'm guilty of a lot of fool stunts! I just didn't realize until now the why of that law.\" \"Don't talk so much,\" the nurse admonished. \"A lot of people have found out the why of that law the hard way, just as you are doing, and lived to remember it. Until hospitals are built on this forlorn world, humans like you who haven't been properly conditioned will have to stay right at home.\" \"How about these men that live and work here?\" \"They never get here until they've been through the mill first. Adenoids, appendix', all the extra parts they can get along without.\" \"Well,\" Judith said. \"I've certainly learned my lesson!\" Gray didn't answer, but from out of the darkness surrounding her came a sound remarkably resembling a snort. \"Gray?\" Judith asked fearfully. \"Yes?\" \"Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?\" Rat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that shook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his arms. The burden groaned. \"Gladney!\" Nurse Gray exclaimed. \"I got.\" Rat confirmed. \"Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.\" \"But how?\" she demanded. \"What of Roberds and Peterson?\" \"Trick,\" he sniggered. \"I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in. Very simple.\" He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped buckles. \"And Peterson?\" she prompted. \"Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.\" \" Fan him? I don't understand.\" \"Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.\" Rat finished up and was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings as he padded away. He was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago. Cursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of bullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian snapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped for the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping. \"You've been hurt!\" Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his features. She tried to struggle up. \"Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.\" With lightning fingers he flicked several switches on the panel, turned to her. \"Hold belly. Zoom!\" Gray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes. Rat unlocked the master level and shoved!"}

Rockets roared in the rear. She loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her face tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The Centaurian was grinning at her. \"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished she hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign. \"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest strap was lying loose at his side. \"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three hours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control panel. \"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook her head and looked at the others. \"That isn't doing either of them any good!\" Rat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter—?\" pointing. \"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing itself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies in a week unless it is taken out.\" \"Don't know it,\" he said briefly. \"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded. Rat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe no. Where's it hurt?\" Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further and drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his eyes that night ... only last night ... in the office. Peterson had refused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it. \"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\" \"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do Centaurians rate it exclusively?\" Rat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up there?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars. \"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over in a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to handle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because of an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\" \"So you?\" \"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or will be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for work.\" She shivered. \"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly. \"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat threw up a hand to stop her. \"Leave on! Hot out here.\" \"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\" \"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold, yes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\" Gray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of course! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from another. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her face accented the fact. \"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\" He grinned."}

Sound like Christmas and bottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes swept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front name?\" \"Patti.\" \"Pretty, Patti.\" \"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\" \"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling system groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\" \"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\" Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored her. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring. \"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\" He faced about. \"For her—\" nodding to Judith, \"and him—\" to Gladney, \"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You, me ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of water. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel.

A damnable hot thirst accented by the knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a dried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely bitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in the hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous hand, wiped damp hair from about her face. \"I have to have a drink.\" Rat stared at her without answer. \"I said, I have to have a drink!\" \"Heard you.\" \"Well...?\" \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\" She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made his way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do like this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and under, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap. They stood there glaring idiotically at each other. She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat inched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet. \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat down on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell and it's hot! It must be fuel!\" Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful he swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he contrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let some of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and it cost him something. \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in. Swish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\" \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste of the fuel. \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\" \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\" \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like pancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental flick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by a quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his belt. \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded. Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa—\" the word was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled the vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had suddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another new, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was empty. Bare. No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in the corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded upward , beads glistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again and she looked up. Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at her, amazed, swinging on their stomachs.

Paradoxically, time dropped away like a cloak as the sense of individual hours and minutes vanished, and into its place crept a slow-torturing substitute. As the ship revolved, monotonously, first the ceiling and then the floor took on dullish, maddening aspects, eyes ached continuously from staring at them time and again without surcease. The steady, drumming rockets crashed into the mind and the walls shrieked malevolently on the eyeballs. Dull, throbbing sameness of the poorly filtered air, a growing taint in the nostrils. Damp warm skin, reeking blankets. The taste of fuel in the mouth for refreshment. Slowly mounting mental duress. And above all the drumming of the rockets. Once, a sudden, frightening change of pitch in the rockets and a wild, sickening lurch. Meteor rain. Maddening, plunging swings to the far right and left, made without warning. A torn lip as a sudden lurch tears the faucet from her mouth. A shattered tooth. \"Sorry!\" Rat whispered. \"Shut up and drive!\" she cried. \"Patti ...\" Judith called out, in pain. Peace of mind followed peace of body into a forgotten limbo of lost things, a slyly climbing madness directed at one another. Waspish words uttered in pain, fatigue and temper. Fractiousness. A hot, confined, stale hell. Sleep became a hollow mockery, as bad water and concentrated tablets brought on stomach pains to plague them. Consciousness punctured only by spasms of lethargy, shared to some extent by the invalids. Above all, crawling lassitude and incalescent tempers. Rat watched the white, drawn face swing in the hammock beside him. And his hands never faltered on the controls. Never a slackening of the terrific pace; abnormal speed, gruelling drive ... drive ... drive. Fear. Tantalizing fear made worse because Rat couldn't understand. Smothered moaning that ate at his nerves. Grim-faced, sleep-wracked, belted to the chair, driving! \"How many days? How many days!\" Gray begged of him thousands of times until the very repetition grated on her eardrums. \"How many days?\" His only answer was an inhuman snarl, and the cruel blazing of those inhuman eyes. She fell face first to the floor. \"I can't keep it up!\" she cried. The sound of her voice rolled along the hot steel deck. \"I cant! I cant!\" A double handful of tepid water was thrown in her face. \"Get up!\" Rat stood over her, face twisted, his body hunched. \"Get up!\" She stared at him, dazed. He kicked her. \"Get up!\" The tepid water ran off her face and far away she heard Judith calling.... She forced herself up. Rat was back in the chair."}

Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted to sit up. \"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me! When're you going to start braking , Rat?\" \"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You sick.\" \"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion! We must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\" \"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\" \" Not brake? \" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped for him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his shoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand that? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to shut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make him!\" \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this half-way line?\" He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We passed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders. \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison. \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\" Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot. \"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\" Rat shook his head and said nothing. \"But Roberds said eight days, and he—\" \"—he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days. Now only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed. \"Six days, no brake. No.\" \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This deceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some things I do!\" Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to Earth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\" \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried. Gray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for you !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be somebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\" \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret. \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\" \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught something new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed it, too. The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the vacated position. \"Earth!\" she shouted. \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\" \"Just name it!\" \"Not drink long time. Some water?\" Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the tension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last she appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry. \"There isn't any left, Rat.\" Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at her.

Rat leave post. Not time send call through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\" \"But why didn't you explain?\" He grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\" Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're right, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now. You've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as you get out of the ship.\" \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's done now.\" The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way. \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth pretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\" Gladney stared at him for minutes.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1942. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beach over the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubby ship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across the heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully because of the lesser gravitation. Thig was shorter than the average Earthman—although on Ortha he was well above the average in height—but his body was thick and powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens. The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans. Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet, however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets. The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha. Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished metal at the reflection of himself! The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped across the mouth and neck of the stranger...."}

{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_2#0", "contents": "Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't dared touch the machine since. For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great adventure—or the trip was off. So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a salable yarn.... \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the road. \"What's the trouble?\" Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more."}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_3#0", "contents": "\"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\" \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he wears he might be Thig.\" \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the two inner planets.\" \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use of our limbs so.\" \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\" \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted Terry's body and headed for the laboratory. Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion, their love-life, their everything! So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their heads. For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet. \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades. \"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.\" An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running inland to his home. Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place where Jake and Ted had"}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_3#1", "contents": "the gleaming baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.\" An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running inland to his home. Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach! He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from around his heart. Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding the emotions that swept through his acquired memory. Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed, trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked achingly up into his throat. \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\" and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\""}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_4#0", "contents": "\"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped. For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this way, he realized—more natural. \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing but a handful of these.\" He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung, unbelieving, to his arm. \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\" \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he hoped that the west had reformed. \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\" \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin."}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_5#0", "contents": "\"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it. \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\" Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the chaos of his cool Orthan brain. Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world, including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would, of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people, imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the Hordes? Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty added zest to every day's life. The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered, would one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast mechanical hives. There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever, who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept—the son of Ellen and the man he had destroyed. Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the"}

He sprang off the porch and strode away down the road toward the beach. The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the door and called after him. \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\" He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound. Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never be written, but he toyed with the idea. So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from the unquestioning worship of the Horde!"}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_6#0", "contents": "\"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to Ortha at once. \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient for the purposes of complete liquidation.\" \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own degree of knowledge and comfort?\" \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\" \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely. \"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet. There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long forgotten.\" \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\" Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes. The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an empty world—this planet was not for them. \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need this planet.\" Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its case.

He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac of the finest members of the Horde. \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly. \"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\" Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it could be uttered. Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand fought against that lone arm of Thig."}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_7#0", "contents": "The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked. Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated matter. Horror for what he had done—that he had slain one of his own Horde—made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the narrowed icy eyes of his commander. He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way. His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy yarn—they would all be dead anyhow soon. Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow...."}
{"chunk_id": "QUEST_OF_THIG_8#0", "contents": "Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed him with those savage blows upon the head. Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his unconscious body. Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible for his sudden madness. The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the weapon. He tugged it free. In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face, the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled out into a senseless whinny. Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and chest. He was a madman! The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove. The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of the Orthan. So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that victory had given him to drive him along. He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all. He went to the desk where Torp had been"}

After all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all. He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and read the last few nervously scrawled lines: Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended. Already I feel the insidious virus of.... And there his writing ended abruptly. Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message. Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's hull, and cut free from the mother vessel. He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his. Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving him from the parent ship. He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first existence. He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the monotonous routine of existence that had once been his—and his heart thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days he had spent on his three month trip over Earth. He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching the ship echoed through the hull-plates. He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that crowded his mind.

And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that, despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer space. He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories were hot, bitter pains."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us. But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by Luna's bulk, we know little. Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth. In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a sheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated them aloud. \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\" The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle giant. Noork grinned. \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her. \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you hunter or escaped slave?\" \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked you.\" Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never far from the hilt of her hunting dagger. Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder of limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the"}

The girl exclaimed at his brown skin. \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet you speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes opened yet wider. \"Who are you?\" \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for my friend.\" The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\" \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\" \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\" Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply."}
{"chunk_id": "Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2#0", "contents": "The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks. \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little sandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will listen to it no more.\" But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive.... The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along the game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers. \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\" Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to your city of Grath....\" He smiled. The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, numbing it so he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with, Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. Noork At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied with the mud of the trail. Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy.

He climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of the great limb and filled his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads vanished. These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons were two long knives and a club. \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like this.\" Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the drying fabric of the mantle and donned it."}

For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal war. A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath. \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water will trap you.\" Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted. \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\" \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.\" \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull. \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save his father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman called Sarna.\" And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake of Uzdon. To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley. But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the golden-skinned girl, was from another world also. The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork, the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and perhaps then he could remember better who he had been. So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.

The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk. The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but Dietrich's spacer had crashed. Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb."}

Though he could not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly blade well. After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's edge. Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of a braided leather rope to the ground beyond. He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull! Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep. \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\" Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together beneath his tree. \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the two slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than another's.\" \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the younger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\" The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\" \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\" \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions, are not unkind. \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will complete my checking of the gardens.\" Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back, and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles that his presence was known.

I have come to rescue the girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\" Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work. \"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He nodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\" \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape from the island I will take you along.\" Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto. \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed. \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where Tholon Sarna is held.\" The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work. \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple pits.\" \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\" \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I talked with you?\" Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave."}

{"chunk_id": "Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_5#0", "contents": "The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at three distinct levels. Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple. Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another of their number. He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the wolf-headed shape a female. These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu! Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to the slaves and common citizens of the island. As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two short swords rose to bar his way. \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere gruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the sacrifice is chosen.\" Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked.

He grumbled something inaudible and drew his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside. In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his left. His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back. The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully. For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to blood-slippery step. The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more. He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps. In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion of the upper temple was muted to a murmur. So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm. He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes. Noork grinned. From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer here in the artificial light of the flickering torch. Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two others, rolled up, beneath his own"}

The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the chamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl, was held prisoner."}
{"chunk_id": "Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6#0", "contents": "The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and toward this Noork made his way. He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\" There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope hide. One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall. \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike. \"The priest,\" hissed the girl. Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he faced the burly priest of the Skull. Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man. \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do not trust your guards, then.\" The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the silent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me your face before I kill you!\" Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he offered. The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that drew blood from left shoulder to elbow. The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade.

Even so his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon. The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple, and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his enemy. Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets. Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms. Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders. \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely. \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know that this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile crossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told the girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\" Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway entrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the priest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the new robe. \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's curious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision slot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the girl's hand. \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is given.\""}

Another slave was working in a nearby field, his crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not watching when Rold abruptly faded from view. Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of the vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had no wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens of the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the escape of the slaves. They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging as he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping from below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of them climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the jungle matted ground outside the wall. \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full voice. Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think not,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island to the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we will paddle boldly across the water.\" \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the shore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite the Temple of Uzdon.\" \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\" said Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will have put a safe distance between us.\" Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands of the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the grassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered and the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat. \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I am broiled alive.\" Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him. \"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They carry nets and clubs to trap us.\" Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his heels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore them to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one hooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and bodies of the enemy. A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they were stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously and a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice changed—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork. \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but was not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\""}

{"chunk_id": "Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8#0", "contents": "A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a nose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that of Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich had trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase. The man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he remembered. \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you can tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the secret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and make the Fatherland invincible.\" \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies? There is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face thoughtfully. \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said. \"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\" Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise that was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's defenseless ribs. \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly, and in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe and Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist repeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a pretense.\" His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain Dietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on Noork's bronzed chest. And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless fingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide belly. He stumbled backward. Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and his men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies. In a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt invisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him. As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop aside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed. \"Gurn!\" cried Noork. A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother. And then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles of Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they concealed. Rold whimpered fearfully. \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty Ones skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon we would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\" \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would have trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\" He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His chest expanded proudly. \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name.

My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace with you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\" \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal officer at a small post. But I had in mind one of those charming resort worlds, with only an occasional visa problem, or perhaps a distressed spaceman or two a year. Instead, I'm zoo-keeper to these confounded settlers. And not for one world, mind you, but eight!\" He stared glumly at Vice-Consul Retief. \"Still,\" Retief said, \"it gives an opportunity to travel—\" \"Travel!\" the consul barked. \"I hate travel. Here in this backwater system particularly—\" He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared his throat. \"Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for a junior officer. Marvelous experience.\" He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram appeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk representing the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the innermost planet. \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers—a mere handful of them—have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with an intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why they bother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However I have, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to take certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you in to handle the situation, Retief—under sealed orders.\" He picked up a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the Terrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late. I'm expected to produce a miracle—a rapprochement between Terrestrial and Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure would look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\" He passed the buff envelope across to Retief. \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the Terrestrial settlers arrived.\" \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief with a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a delicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu element introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at Sector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\" \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\" \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions, you'd best be on your way.

If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of here.\" \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\" \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started punching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist. \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\" The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief blocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty shootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\" \"The mail must go through, you know.\" \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll tell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\" \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\" The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in. We're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob one this way....\" Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the controls. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a heavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as well take this.\" \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\" \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\" The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff dropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the departing mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the manual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine.... A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out. Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy radiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed but by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a high trajectory and had no connection with the skiff.... Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed. He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This was going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief threw the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the oncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen, correcting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no more than 1000 yards. At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past the missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining harness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and harmless.

If they were ordinary chemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The screen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on its back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of shocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the ping of hot metal contracting."}

He beat out sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it open. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed of shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet whined past his ear. He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left. He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere a song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life, buzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush five yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped. Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log. A stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving cautiously, a pistol in his hand. As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him. They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then struggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist— \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\" \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea of shooting at me?\" \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a Flap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something move. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin' here? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack country over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert lay. \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\" \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\" \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't expect—\" \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be joining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\" \"Yes. I'm—\" \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad mistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\" \"I'm—\" \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand weapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief followed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter got to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face. \"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat under those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you was raised different.\" \"As a matter of fact—\" \"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand up on 'Dobe.\" Retief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue blazer and slacks. \"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I guess leather has its points.\" \"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown. And, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a Flap-jack.\" \"I won't, but—\" Potter was on"}

Retief pulled off the sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and followed Potter. II \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two revolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in bad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't made a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we hadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it was fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire, added a stick. \"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed two of his cattle, and pulled back.\" \"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were out for revenge.\" \"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They don't look nothin' like—\" \"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries before. They know better now.\" Bert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we, Potter? Got four.\" \"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\" Swazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and run.\" \"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just like a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\" \"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid. But lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got some kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles. We've lost four men now and a dozen more in the freezer, waiting for the med ship. We can't afford it. The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied men.\" \"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are old sea-beds—a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of hundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em while there's a man alive.\" \"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms we're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\" \"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But you know these Embassy stooges.\" \"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell us to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He tightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\" \"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at Retief."}

He eyed Retief. \"Who's that?\" \"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\" \"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief. \"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped."}

But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it away.\" Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\" Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He stumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the dirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met a straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold. \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\" \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\" Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night lizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes, peered past the fire— With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it over the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a split second behind him. \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see pretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert from the left, me and Potter from the right.\" \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\" \"What's the idea...?\" \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a treetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward."}
{"chunk_id": "RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_5#0", "contents": "Five minutes' stealthy progress brought him to a slight rise of ground. With infinite caution he raised himself, risking a glance over an out-cropping of rock. The stunted trees ended just ahead. Beyond, he could make out the dim contour of rolling desert. Flap-jack country. He got to his feet, clambered over the stone—still hot after a day of tropical heat—and moved forward twenty yards. Around him he saw nothing but drifted sand, palely visible in the starlight, and the occasional shadow of jutting shale slabs. Behind him the jungle was still. He sat down on the ground to wait. It was ten minutes before a movement caught his eye. Something had separated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards of open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The shape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt the butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be right this time.... There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of sand as the Flap-jack charged. Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping Flap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all muscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge rippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter. It scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's shoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his feet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it was, it seemed more like five hundred. The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a thumb slip into an orifice— The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper. \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't gentlemanly, but it's effective....\" The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief relaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the thumb dug in. The alien went limp again, waiting. \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\""}
{"chunk_id": "RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_6#0", "contents": "Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart of thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry forays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the Flap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his back, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation was correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long.... A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off. He got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an agitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket. \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks were falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as loudly as words. There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of presences drawing closer. Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now, looming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks came in all sizes. A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded out. Retief cocked his head, frowning. \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said. \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness. \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\" \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\" \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\" \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\" \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It flopped once, disappeared into the darkness. \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said, \"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\" \"Delighted.\" Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny barrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to a low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow. \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the voice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\" \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\" Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling, Retief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like burgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of polished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious room, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes. III \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said. Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings, rippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back. \"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\" \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can avoid it.\" \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the silence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We can resolve these matters later.

I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns.\" \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red Tape,\" Retief added. \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude couches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room, communed silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating devices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\" A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray laden with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the drinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good. \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our metabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a delicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau d'Yquem. \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\" said Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous earth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He raised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief returned the salute and drank. \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were sportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a bit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a few trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate show. Or so I hope.\" \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my asking?\" \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well, I'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a contest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such a bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come upon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made captive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically keen tracker.\" \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out, spawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\" \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics. Have you tried the ground-gwack eggs?

Curious. What forms are those?\" \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but lacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such worthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\" \"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to point it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are much the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed scratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\" \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against a serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate. Therefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions so dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to these contests altogether....\" Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air. \"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\" \"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red Tape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the newest sporting principles.\" \"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm enthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\" \"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the two individuals settle the issue between them.\" \"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could one attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\" \"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We don't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\" \"You don't mean...?\" \"That's right. You and me.\""}
{"chunk_id": "RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_8#0", "contents": "Outside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol, followed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him. By the faint light he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack rearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack retainers were grouped behind him. \"I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,\" said Hoshick. He sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. \"My spawn-fellows will never credit this. Such a curious turn fashion has taken. How much more pleasant it is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a distance.\" \"I suggest we use Tennessee rules,\" said Retief. \"They're very liberal. Biting, gouging, stomping, kneeing and of course choking, as well as the usual punching, shoving and kicking.\" \"Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid endo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.\" \"Of course,\" Retief said, \"if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of contest....\" \"By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to even it.\" \"Very well. Shall we begin?\" With a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and leaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by a mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside as Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right hay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe around in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning onto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him. Retief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed him. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back. Hoshick nestled closer. Retief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering weight. Nothing budged. It was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete. He remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice had been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area.... He groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing skin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice and probed. The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with the other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would be a set of ready made hand-holds...."}

Retief held on, scrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on top of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped in terror, then went limp. Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard. Hoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved gingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted him into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily, adjusted the volume. \"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden one's sportsmanship places on one at times.\" \"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to continue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our gougerforms—\" \"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've given me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a year.\" \"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform—\" \"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his hide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had hoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\" he said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might plan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop of paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But my spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms without end. I am shamed before you....\" \"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the action from a distance too.\" \"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\" \"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No one who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by mere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the sand, raising lichens—things like that—\" \"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the wine is made.\" \"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition. Now, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll promise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\" Hoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious? You would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\" \"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\" Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone me, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\" \"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of rules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think some of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\" IV It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed on with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle.

Mister, we been livin' on stump water for a year now. 'Dobe's fatal to the kind of bacteria it takes to ferment likker.\" \"Try this.\" Retief handed over a sqat jug. Swazey drew the cork, sniffed, drank and passed it to Lemuel. \"Mister, where'd you get that?\" \"The Flap-jacks make it. Here's another question for you: Would you concede a share in this planet to the Flap-jacks in return for a peace guarantee?\" At the end of a half hour of heated debate Lemuel turned to Retief. \"We'll make any reasonable deal,\" he said. \"I guess they got as much right here as we have. I think we'd agree to a fifty-fifty split. That'd give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side.\" \"What would you say to keeping all the oases and giving them the desert?\" Lemuel reached for the wine jug, eyes on Retief. \"Keep talkin', mister,\" he said. \"I think you got yourself a deal.\""}

Speak up. Don't expect me to request any military assistance, no matter how things are....\" Retief passed a bundle of documents across the desk. \"Here's the Treaty.

Only two men stood in its way, one a cowardly rat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns in a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen of fate—and even the winner would lose. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Ryd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and watched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The shuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his right, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a ship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships. Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so overhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the almost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing darkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming minnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi Mesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted up—draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining them gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819, relief was in sight. Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to shuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis' dive. The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were asleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis' which were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen, these days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For Dynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had been built to be the power center of North America. The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged himself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone recognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something else. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with surprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face. Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer and maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was heartened. \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his back to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so that his jowls quivered. \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\" The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it convulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you setting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since—\" Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship that just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars—the escort they were sending"}

He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship that just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars—the escort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming in again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his shoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again. Jobs for all the bums in this town—even for you.\" He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear his head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again, huh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio man—no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit of working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and then took it away. He drank still more deeply. The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on his arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Saboteur_of_Space_2#0", "contents": "Ryd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any plain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody he had ever known—an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a beak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for the thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the face, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and almost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray cellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'. \"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\" \"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage floated to the top by alcohol. The other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself. He leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and distinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\" \" Huh? Why, yeh—I guess so—\" \"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his daze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish crowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made frantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger fumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out, past the blue-and-gold-lit meloderge that was softly pouring out its endlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark. Outside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on them. They kept walking—so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath, long-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air. \"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence. \"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\" Ryd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If you're a cop, say so!\" The other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a chance. For a come-back, Ryd—a chance to live again.... My name—you can call me Mury.\" Ryd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the tall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with his first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his eyes. \"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\" \"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\" \"And why, Ryd?\" \"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow shoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn good one, too—I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the physique for Mars—I might just have made it then , but I thought the plant was going to open again and—\" And that was it.

And after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its full economic independence—and domination. For power is—power; and there is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two in ten could live healthily on the outer world. \"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the Power Company of North America—the main plant by Dynamopolis itself, that shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down outside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\" Ryd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in this strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few men who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn them! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't have a drag with any of the Poligerents.\" \"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly. Ryd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old kicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Saboteur_of_Space_3#0", "contents": "All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him squarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far from where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet Freighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile twisted Mury's thin lips. \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd—you mean nothing at all to me as an individual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am working—the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and sold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after they've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered their hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to be refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor capitulate frankly to him.\" Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such ideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are you talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily. Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian cargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said simply, \"Yes.\" \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had heard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The power cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in the arm—no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis. It will turn the wheels and light the cities and—\" \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up slightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't you know you're repeating damnable lies?\" Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a passion shocking after his smooth calm: \"The power shell is aid, yes—but with what a price! It's the thirty pieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have sold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and vision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable conflict, they're selling us out—making Earth, the first home of man, a colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great Martian land-owners? Do you? \" He paused out of breath; then finished venomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper than robots—cheap as slaves !\" \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you want me to do about it?\" Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was once more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're going to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\" Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly, \"What's that mean?\" \"The power shell—isn't coming in as planned.\" \"You can't do that.\" \" We can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there are fifty thousand credits in"}

Are you with us?\" Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing certainly—if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by this man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as We never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing, desperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and panclasm—that was We . The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with an effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the monosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to lose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth. \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with which he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they had come. Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his volition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to placate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever happened.... After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and whined, \"Where ... where we going now?\" Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the gray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he pointed as Ryd had known he would—toward where a pale man-made dawn seemed breaking over Pi Mesa. II \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell upon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had killed the guard. The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky moon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to drop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the long, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and servicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a little stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now. He was caught in the machinery. Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing the weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short wrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown the aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State order had grounded all fliers in America. \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow.

I've brought you this far—you're taking me the rest of the way.\" The rest of the way. Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous exertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the guarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air, shook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's uniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as he clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons to recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol, powerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong fingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into the sardonic black eyes of the Panclast. \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry wouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a stage property for the little play we're going to give in about three minutes—when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of Dynamopolis, aboard the towship Shahrazad .\" For a moment Ryd felt relief—he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred of Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage the Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long, low buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship would also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air. Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light scraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands and face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light. He had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a small, disused metal door. Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save for the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It seemed to be crying: run, run —but he remembered the power that knew how to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering. The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside, and Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The same automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the air-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the long-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in."}

A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control cupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film of dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of the disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal door marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway down which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and launched into the sky once more by now dormant machines. \"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his long legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence, he was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead. They emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to the right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many lights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights shed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long runways—no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis' glory—stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful of odd ships—mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had berthed—huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by the chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa. As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of protective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport. Surely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed buildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must mean safety for them. And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching for all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once inside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough. Nonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last, inconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower. Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the midst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies, their principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two officers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet. Blue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance—watched boredly enough. And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number Two Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive magnets—the Shahrazad , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of steam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out of Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be sounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now. \"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be aboard the Shahrazad when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes shifted, hardening, toward Runway Four.

We'll be aboard the Shahrazad when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes shifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there beyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with blind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters. It had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving again very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding its crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and immobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet. \"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively. \"Martian soldier robots!\" \"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in weapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For God's sake, take it easy.\" Ryd licked dry lips. \"Are we going—out into space?\" \"Where else?\" said Mury."}
{"chunk_id": "Saboteur_of_Space_5#0", "contents": "The official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat had reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought to question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed guardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards from the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was—as it came about—just a little too late. The guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving pair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing uneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle in sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between the solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other in perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the Shahrazad's airlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables attracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety by the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up. The slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and vanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the topmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face, but with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation. \"Yes?\" he inquired frostily. \"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure silhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all aboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be—\" \"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted the tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the delivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused, sighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I suppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\" The guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century bureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod with an appearance of brusqueness. Fully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the pompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive instead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as he reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun no longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent, pointing at its licensed owner. \"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the while his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard with us.\" The guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed civic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the ancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both hands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway—for he was still very sick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous. Above, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved wall, white and jittering.

He complied, grasping the railing with both hands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway—for he was still very sick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous. Above, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved wall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable countersunk mirror of metal. \"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out the heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously tremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his fears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on the side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock. Nothing happened. \"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up, the lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel."}
{"chunk_id": "Saboteur_of_Space_6#0", "contents": "Mury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said. Then, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and the three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are on the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the switch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central control panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\" Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch he had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets. Ryd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as he slipped cat-like into the passage. \"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\" Ryd backed—the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own nervous gaze—and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal pressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering somewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall. He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning, back against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled to keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a crouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing lever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch outside. The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant, the flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a scorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite lock a foot from Mury's right shoulder. \"You damned clumsy little fool—\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then, while the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with blue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two quick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the starboard airlock. Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to the Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But the latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped in their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in an instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned guardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his little cell of steel. \"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond, youthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with an astrogator's triangled stars which made him ex officio the brains of the vessel. \"Stealing a ship—it can't be done any more.\" \"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half of it. But—you will. I'll need you. As for your friends—\" The gun muzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of those clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\" He had to repeat the command, in tones"}

You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\" He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before they started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from themselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor; the weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting still masked and apparently unmoved, demanded: \"What do you think you're trying to do?\" \"What do you think?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship into space. On schedule and on course—to meet the power shell.\" The flame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you—what's your name?\" \"Yet Arliess.\" \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\" The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking goggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he said as if in wonder, \"I do.\" III Shahrazad drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly to the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped cabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its banked dials, watching their steady needles. Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness draining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into emptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the maindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed him; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces and lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and up, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities—and Ryd had lost every sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under the towship's keel. A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the control panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights confused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the control room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect hum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning gyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the engines. Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right. \"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't mean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in the pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved hands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the sloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun. Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his head groggily as he ran"}

Clipped to the sloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun. Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his head groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He ventured shakily, \"Where are we?\" Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess, still masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I understand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he is holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he is an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of duty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of the Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\" The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him through his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights burned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous tracks. Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly, he inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame seemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of light. \"What's that, Arliess?\" The astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\" \"I know that well enough. What ship?\" \"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that that's the liner Alborak , out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission for Mars.\" Mury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you suppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that drive.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice was raw and unsteady. \"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for us—will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\""}

Uranian death lay athwart the space lanes. But Shano already knew this was his last ride. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1949. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Mercurian night settled black and thick over the Q City Spaceport. Tentative fingers of light flicked and probed the sky, and winked out. \"Here she comes,\" somebody in the line ahead said. Shano coughed, his whole skeletal body jerking. Arthritic joints sent flashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling neither glad nor sad. He coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes. The spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter catapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail. High up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of bright specks—portholes of the liner Stardust —sank slowly down. There was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from a lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting, lugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home to die. As though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long shark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery snuggle into the cradle's ribs. The passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed: \" Stardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All passengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes. \" Shano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following around the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard stubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the vanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing desire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long. \" Attention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The signal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five minutes. \" The man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the infinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking Shano aside as he passed. Red signal. In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his eyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out there. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own risk. He felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously. A hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest. Plucking at an urgency there. Dropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line had dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into the scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked. \" Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus ,\" the loud-speaker said monotonously.

Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly of twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light. He clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the lieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen, chunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket. \"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\" Shano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\" he said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint memories within his glazed mind. The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\" The loud-speaker blared. \" Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The signal is red. Stardust, taking— \" With the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock. The officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was shut off. Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more locks, closing each behind them. \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light danced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration gradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in."}

The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat in a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones. \"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing briefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He flicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious, squared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out there. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one, which just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be so lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\" Shano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was driv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things about them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears things, a laborer does.\" The captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of his lone passenger, and he became a little gruff. \"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own risk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible. When the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few hours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device aboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears from each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert watchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some, by the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\" Shano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto. Where a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain, what's a notched jaw mean to you?\" \"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him around. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to your cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door. Descending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the nick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The man turned and gripped Shano's thin arm. \"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter disk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed cut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of his tunic was a purple band, with the name Rourke . \"Why are you so anxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's trouble ahead, you know.\" Shano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred sluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled down the steel deck. In his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked, coughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead.

The slow movement of his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other. What were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had he heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive suspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of Uranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a rumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded it. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and waited."}
{"chunk_id": "SIGNAL_RED_3#0", "contents": "The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken watch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a loud-speaker blared throughout the ship. \" All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all machinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there, listening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance. Atmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop pumps. \" Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the vibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out. Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the pipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and his lungs. He choked. The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the deck outside. Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously. Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men, glimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano blinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched, hurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship. He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand. Shano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through labyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering against the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the distance and Shano stopped. He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his cabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return. A bell clanged. Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled hopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure disappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM. Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster of vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a gray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium dial that quivered delicately. Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above and below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises diminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out; everything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears."}
{"chunk_id": "SIGNAL_RED_4#0", "contents": "The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it or hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a submarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy. The ship's speaker rasped softly. \" Emergency. Battle posts. \" The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's body. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly overhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've heard us.\" The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant. A slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by detectors of the Uranian space fleet. Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled himself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased, gum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent his going home—even to die. This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence. Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order. \"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension. The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging, maybe maneuvering—Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was all. \"Fire number seven.\" He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting terror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band. This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying to blast the Stardust out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the captain dodged and fired back—pitted his skill and knowledge against an enemy Shano couldn't see. He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to Earth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough. The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound. It rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead. \"Hold fire.\" He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and pulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray metal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering dial needle. \"Hey!\" he said. \"Stand by.\" Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking. Only working with his hands. This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed down.... \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch on duty.\" Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space liner Stardust . Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with concentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut in his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up to something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.

He'd never believe there was a traitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away the ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man. He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made him cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it opened cautiously. A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw Shano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face dark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face. \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\" Shano blinked. Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to be in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\" Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength and youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he said. \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face. He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed face, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the deck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano clung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing, cursing the pain in his joints. Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with his gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked. He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he was dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and coughing."}

An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice came, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine room—report! Engine room—\" Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and put a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his pocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding of feet. What was going on now? \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system. Engine room!\" Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom motors whirring in the background. \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates. We've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\" Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth. \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's head, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's useless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the chief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber. Engine room's full of toxia gas!\" Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe. The Stardust's mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It reproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're about midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove them off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know we've been hit. We have to get away fast!\" Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick with moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out what the matter was with his space ship. The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine room full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And we have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without the gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair the broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\" \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you by-pass the selector?\" \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass through selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments will operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep trying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine temperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir—they're common tungsten steel—and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and drop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there he might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each time it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\" The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the talk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer.

He didn't understand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken down in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would come streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to bits. And he would never get home to die. Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged lungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the tunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with gum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting sick where other men had died, their insides burned out. Shano smoked and thought."}
{"chunk_id": "SIGNAL_RED_6#0", "contents": "They wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through the emergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And they wouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxia gas. Shano coughed. He squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The guts of the space ship. Then he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from a fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working away. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down pins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his hands, and shook his head. \"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in your life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'll kill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours. Another man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't clogged with Juno gum.\" He grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slipped the forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well, maybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway. What was that again? Oh yeah—just lift them up, and when they drop off, lift them up again. Shano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back suddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and machinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another jerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and lifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank the way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job, the way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then lifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting pain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the high, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery go. He was running the cosmic drive. A bell clanged somewhere. \"Engine room! Engine room! We're under way! What happened?\" Silence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking about the Earth he hadn't seen for many years. \"Captain!\" the speaker bawled. \"There's a man in there! Working the valve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn't....\" Shano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steel rods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the liner Stardust toward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet. If he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After that.... \"Home,\" he coughed. \"Hell! Who wants to go home?\" He plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian fleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled ship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano. A useless old man. Coughing came out all mixed up with laughing."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] It's one thing to laugh at a man because his job is useless and outdated—another to depend on him when it suddenly isn't. In the northland, deep, and in a great cave, by an everburning fire the Warrior sleeps. For this is the resting time, the time of peace, and so shall it be for a thousand years. And yet we shall summon him again, my children, when we are sore in need, and out of the north he will come, and again and again, each time we call, out of the dark and the cold, with the fire in his hands, he will come. — Scandinavian legend Throughout the night, thick clouds had been piling in the north; in the morning, it was misty and cold. By eight o'clock a wet, heavy, snow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were all down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee and remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It was well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed in a field near the settlement. There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the colonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore grumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had convenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but no one went out to greet them. After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship and stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained there, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly thing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or just plain orneriness. \"Well, I never,\" a nice lady said. \"What's he just standing there for?\" another lady said. And all of them thought: well, God knows what's in the mind of a soldier, and right away many people concluded that he must be drunk. The seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children and the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so carefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally, to despise soldiers. The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_2#0", "contents": "Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and pathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out in that miserable cold to meet him. The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not too clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than Rossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were tears gathering in the ends of his eyes. \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a message from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\" Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you want a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\" The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes. Then he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel. It was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He was about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the hovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man appeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan. \"C'n I go now, Jim?\" Dylan turned and nodded. \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning, he yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and put it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A moment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift. \"Was he drunk ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of liquor ?\" The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the envelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We haven't much time.\" He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As Rossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but could not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch that, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy clouds and the cold. After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_3#0", "contents": "The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien race occurred out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way from home. Late in the year 2360—the exact date remains unknown—an alien force attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and the dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the army. When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists, thirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children, were missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines, even books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were the bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had, nobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier finally stumbled on something. For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main buildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be buried in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow a whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb at Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The detonating wire had been cut. In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of earth, the wire had been dug up and cut. The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five hundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small, weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread the news, and Man began to fall back. In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of the colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died in fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those ships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a society which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only defense Earth had. This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth with a bottle on his hip."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_4#0", "contents": "An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven face, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and listened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists were beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great suddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait, between acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage. Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those in the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan grinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake it and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly and inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and impregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set up automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever having lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home out of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But at least this was better than the wailing of the cities. This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all by any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an outcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing. He stirred restlessly. By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much to say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: \"Lupus, Lupus—doesn't that mean wolves or something?\" Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very possible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for discussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the hell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it. But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of women began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their anger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and confronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance. \"See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our home . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been paying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you earned your keep. We demand....\" It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped that he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him now and giving him that name of ancient contempt, \"soldier boy.\" The gloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was. \"There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that were obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for the brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.\""}

{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_5#0", "contents": "Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted the army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was not the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be coming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had realized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history of Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble dream, it was ended now and it was time to move. \"We'd better get going,\" he finally said, and there was quiet. \"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of this system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed to have you gone by then.\" For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and the rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two stopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man said he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off his planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to check the bomb, grateful for the action. Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the radio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the wire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and it felt fine. Dylan had been called up out of a bar—he and Bossio—and told what had happened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This would be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him. After thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk, a man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like that. It would take time. He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip. Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain. Well, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty years he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way along the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled and got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot of ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and he had done them all. Once he had even studied military tactics. He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green. But he'd been only nineteen when his father died—of a hernia, of a crazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked too long on a heavy planet—and in those days the anti-war conditioning out on the Rim was not very strong.

They talked a lot about guardians of the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down doctor. And ... now he was a captain. He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait and the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days was upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell with it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of the bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults which are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the core of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point: it made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed nobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something pleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands. Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it threw him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire had just been cut."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_6#0", "contents": "Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his hands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and then, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real, there was no time for that. When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he did not notice the wire. \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\" Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with more'n ten. Why?\" His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack. \"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take forty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\" Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no iron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\" \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck—she's all we could afford.\" Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that somebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\" It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said quickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can. Maybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\" The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around him and the scurrying people. \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\" Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\" Because the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but he said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or another, we won't leave anybody.\" It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had happened. Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then buried it again and packed it down real nice.\" \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded. \"Who?\" \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on a live bomb like this, but I never....\" \"You think one of your people did it?\" Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\" \"Why?\" \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like most government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\""}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_7#0", "contents": "It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was silent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily, \"Maybe an animal?\" Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or found it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think? The wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one is cut too—newly cut.\" The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white. \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that a bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that something didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the center of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then walked right out again.\" \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\" He started away but Dylan caught his arm. \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them. I'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\" Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his hands. He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that he'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was perhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire. All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How? Telepathy? Could they somehow control one of us? No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there would be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really know. Were they small? Little animals? Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable brain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large as a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long before a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly shown up, Rossel would certainly know about it. He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel. He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he straightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out his pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last time he had fired it. He never had—he never had fired a gun."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_8#0", "contents": "The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do but stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing wall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until there was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights and the snow. By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to try to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still didn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window through the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which were beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still drunk—maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan held no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind of guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be waiting.... A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the shack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like to know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but he said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at the same time, because now they were coming to him. He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it was bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they wouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their ship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put a call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only answer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and he wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you could not blame him. Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man—who turned out to be Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically cleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope. \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might get the rest of the folks out on that.\" Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\" \"But they have a contract!\" The soldier grinned. The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said: \"Who cut that wire, Cap?\""}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_9#0", "contents": "Dylan swung slowly to look at him. \"As far as I can figure, an alien cut it.\" Rush shook his head. \"No. Ain't been no aliens near this camp, and no peculiar animals either. We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no unidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year ago.\" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. \"Uh-uh. One of us did it.\" The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet. \"Telepathy?\" asked Dylan. \"Might be.\" \"Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if one of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?\" Rush calmly—at least outwardly calmly—lit his pipe. There was a strength in this man that Dylan had missed before. \"Don't know,\" he said gruffly. \"But these are aliens, mister. And until I know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.\" He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending. Then Rossel jumped. \"My God!\" Dylan moved to quiet him. \"Look, is there any animal at all that ever comes near here that's as large as a dog?\" After a pause, Rush answered. \"Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like a reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we landed. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.\" He rose slowly, the rifle held under his arm. \"I b'lieve we might just as well go post them sentries.\" Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to say. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained expression on his face, to put through that call to Three. When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, \"Where you want them sentries? I got Walt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.\" Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow. \"You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises, within calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five minutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.\" The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. \"Nice day for huntin',\" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering his footprints."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_10#0", "contents": "The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide warm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae; curiously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans come. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He saw that they were armed. He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced lizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been watching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware of their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave. That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that night and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But flexibility , he reminded himself sternly, is the first principle of absorption , and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection reached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the hour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer told him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and that the attack there had probably begun. The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay quietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow, thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he would not have to venture out into that miserable cold. Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was distinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could take no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single button, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling of the colonists' ship."}
{"chunk_id": "SOLDIER_BOY_11#0", "contents": "When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow, thinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later the realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three had never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard the signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was all they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered. There was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the air was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan. Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what he felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said hopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the men in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and he was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what would have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But even stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he realized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then that he thought of Bossio. Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three was dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was gone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow. More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead—the one thing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had. In all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his friendship and his trust. He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the people were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were beginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him with hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore. Bossio—a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no grudges—Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried to help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days of his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and die to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four hours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now, when it was far, far too late, they were coming to the army for help."}

All they had ever wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood that the Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders, still they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to no conflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be learned. So he could not hate these people. But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went into the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might be leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see the fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and tried, for the last time, to call Bossio. After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was a very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and he was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he must be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a mackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone. They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of everyone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like that, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the coffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the ship. It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see a great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes. Then he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the weight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some of the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and were still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went automatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The elders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep themselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up. In the end, the ship took forty-six people. Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him standing by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried in her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected, rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went slipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never understood before, because he had never once been among men in great trouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while there was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and the airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp burning smell—she couldn't get off the ground."}

I They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course. In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension. They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned up at all. In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much. The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards. But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard. He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony, boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.

{"chunk_id": "SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_2#0", "contents": "The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact, Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses. That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under the Ultrawelfare State. Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home, Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have miserably failed.\" Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy. In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\" \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has been trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the road to his destiny.\" His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\" \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our ancestors did?\" Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous pastimes.\" Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food, clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the population is ever called up. But Pond was.

His industrial aptitude dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well. He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to our pleas for a few more trips?\" \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\""}
{"chunk_id": "SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_3#0", "contents": "Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that, seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken man. He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one need face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\" His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been increasingly hard to come by—even though in our minds, Hans, we are near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space Exploration.\" \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently. \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\" \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement. Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends justify the means?\" Gubelin blinked at him. The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read of the sailor and his way of life?\" \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to do with it?\" \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points, tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\" Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our"}

If he could, I'd personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\" He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted. \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it, nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\" The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern methods, my dear chap.\""}
{"chunk_id": "SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_4#0", "contents": "II Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated. When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run. Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree, a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of dangers met and passed. Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer. He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did you need? It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force. In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution. They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week. It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none of them ever really becoming efficient. The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees were needed, a draft lottery was held. All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen"}

When new employees were needed, a draft lottery was held. All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be sold for a lump sum on the market. Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was obviously called for. He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly. Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks, fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head. Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long denied him. Si was going to do it differently this time. Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The works. But nothing but the best."}

{"chunk_id": "SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_5#0", "contents": "To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided. A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations, titles. Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\" In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The screen went dead. One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years. He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one place really made sense. The big city. He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He might as well do it up brown. He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial. \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud. The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the direction of the pressure was reversed. Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the canopy and stepped into his hotel room. A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present your credit card within ten minutes.\" Si took his time. Not that he really needed it.

A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present your credit card within ten minutes.\" Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis. He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that, he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was. He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the mattress. He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that registration could be completed. For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias. This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond. He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a dime a dozen. He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said, \"Kudos Room.\" The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\""}
{"chunk_id": "SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_6#0", "contents": "At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either. However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made his way to the bar. There was actually a bartender. Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment. He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him. Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to take a look at the others present. To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities. He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked and then swallowed. \" Zo-ro-as-ter ,\" he breathed. She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her eyes. Every pore, but every pore, was in place. She sat with the easy grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West. His stare couldn't be ignored. She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\" There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about building the drink. Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be on me?\" Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out. The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\" The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a space pin?\" Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\" \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\" \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you been on at least a Moon run.\" She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said, \"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave you.\" Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\" She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov."}

Just Natalie. Imagine meeting Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\" \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again. \"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to if they say Seymour.\" \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having met him. Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\" \" Academician Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him Doc ?\" Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like that. But how come you cried?\""}

I suppose it was that speech Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the planets....\" \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\" \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\" Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job, it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop. So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those spaceships costs?\" \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\" Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\" Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\" \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like. Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of materials and all and keep the economy going.\" Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\" Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\" She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\" Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper articles.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] One man's retreat is another's prison ... and it takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home! Forty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you what it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing fear—a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura. Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning.... It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos, were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after spawning its first-born. For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight. The first graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important, because we were the first . We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and grandparents and kid brothers and sisters—the people who a short time ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had never really existed. But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us with pride in their eyes. A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked hard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things. They're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately need. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most important of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up at them and feel humility—for mankind needs humility.\" The speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on Mars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and who had just returned from his second hop to Venus. Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time, for I was thinking: He's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the first!"}

{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_2#0", "contents": "Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't see 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\" I blinked. \"Who?\" \"My folks.\" That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those \"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie Taggart. Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a veteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the Lunar Lady , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White Sands. I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet. My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It wasn't surprising. The Lunar Lady was in White Sands now, but liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars. It doesn't matter , I told myself. Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\" Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that he was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at the Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only half as big. And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw the stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by the sons of Earth. They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and a hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do. I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared."}
{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_3#0", "contents": "At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge, babbling wave. Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie. His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining like a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear rows. But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that it was hard to believe he'd once been young. He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned. \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as good spacemen should!\" Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again, walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm with some silent melody. And you, Laura, were with him. \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\" I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a gentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before. \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for the past year.\" A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an introduction of Charlie. You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old Stardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol. His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing. And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I knew, would find them ugly. You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to meet you, Charlie. Just think—one of Everson's men, one of the first to reach the Moon!\" Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the weekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\" I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're planning to see the town tonight.\" \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their own plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room. Charlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the Moon?\" Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew that he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian fizzes and Plutonian zombies. But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration. \"We'd really like to come,\" I said."}

{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_4#0", "contents": "On our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor should look. \"Ben,\" he called, \"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two months to decide.\" \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\" A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben? Did he make you an offer?\" I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching astrogation. What a life that would be! Imagine standing in a classroom for forty years when I've got the chance to—\" I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you've got the chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you want, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\" I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to understand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart. Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That's what Mickey used to want.\" \" Used to want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\" You bit your lip, not answering. \"What did she mean, Mickey?\" Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben. We've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But—\" \"Yes?\" \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If you're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or another gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\" My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to say, Mickey?\" \"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It's not so exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\" I couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my knees with the blast of a jet. \"It doesn't change anything, Ben—right now, I mean. We can still have a good weekend.\" Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the 'copter. \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_5#0", "contents": "I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course. They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things, deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was cool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or housework. Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a shower, but he tried courageously to be himself. At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit Mars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic. Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough, the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid in your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that. Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\" That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all. Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night, to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally streaked up from White Sands. We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said: \"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's sort of funny.\" \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a spaceman then.\" \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\" I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\" You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster. There was silence. You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the feeling that I shouldn't have come here. You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking, Laura?\" You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be thinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\" \"I could never hate you.\" \"It—it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I lived for months, just thinking about it. \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles, and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I realized England wasn't so"}

But after it was over, I realized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting before you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\" I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think maybe I haven't grown up yet?\" Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman, to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it worth the things you'd have to give up?\" I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up what ?\" Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew. All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path. Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on the stars. Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that I'd never noticed before. You can go into space , I thought, and try to do as much living in ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like Charlie—a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally alone, never finding a home. Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous dust. \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\" \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense—a lot of sense.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_6#0", "contents": "The next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin, tight coughs. Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I'm leavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought maybe you'd like to have 'em.\" I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\" He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh, it's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years. That's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky. Some of these days, I won't be so lucky.\" I tried to laugh. \"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\" He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I'm gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell you what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the Space Rat , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a look inside. I'll probably be there.\" He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears. \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need's some Martian climate.\" Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered, too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were drugged. I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about going to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna. We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I. \"When will you be back?\" you asked. Charlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\" Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man. I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill the doubt worming through my brain. But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was gone."}
{"chunk_id": "Spacemen_Die_at_Home_7#0", "contents": "That afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids treasure—pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy, books, a home-made video. I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy. I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched their children grow to adulthood. I'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and routines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams, I hadn't realized I was different. My folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd have lived the kind of life a kid should live. Mickey noticed my frown. \"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just not like you and Charlie, I guess. I—\" \"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\" \"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\" \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the Odyssey , the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me, too, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than teaching. I want to be in deep space.\" \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy Earth life while you can. Okay?\" I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of courage that would put fuel on dying dreams. But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as much as I loved the stars. And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure, I'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\""}

We did all the little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and promise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted. One morning I thought, Why must I make a choice? Why can't I have both you and the stars? Would that be asking too much? All day the thought lay in my mind like fire. That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I want you to be my wife.\" You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face flushed. Then you murmured, \"I—I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\" \"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\" \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see, Ben? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for maybe two months, maybe two years. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty—and I'd have what?\" Somehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn't have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years, then teach.\" \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\" Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears glittering in your eyes. \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened on the Cyclops . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was flooded with radiation—just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it was—\" \"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\" You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\" That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me sleep. You've got to decide now , I told myself. You can't stay here. You've got to make a choice. The teaching job was still open. The spot on the Odyssey was still open—and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the way to Pluto. You can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now. Or you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a line in a history book. I cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \"Get the hell out of there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you.

It was addressed to me; I wondered who could be sending me a message. I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping, automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\" Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word \"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\" I stood staring at the cylinder. Charles Taggart was dead. Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie. My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie! The audiogram had lied! I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of Charles ...\" I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken voice droned on. You ran to it, shut it off. \"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly—\" Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I remembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze. The metallic words had told the truth. I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at Charlie's faded tin box. Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions—a few wrinkled photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god, a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol. This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space. It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters instead of children, a medal instead of a home. It'd be a great future , I thought. You'd dream of sitting in a dingy stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky, stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first sign of lung-rot. To hell with it!

It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am writing this. I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they could tell me what he could not express in words. And among the things, Laura, I found a ring. A wedding ring. In that past he never talked about, there was a woman—his wife. Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to travel both. He later learned what we already know—that there can be no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose. Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never live to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a man's dream. He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was kind—but that doesn't matter now. Do you know why he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth? It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother, brothers, the planets his children. You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes after you reach it. But how can one ever be sure until the journey is made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a star and think, I might have gone there; I could have been the first ? We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways? Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it. Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning.

She seemed to be restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from the waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed through her hallways. Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was a big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility had pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his reddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies were rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the control room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.

It could wait. \"Anything new during the night?\" \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways north of us.

They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have an almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And our two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them in the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\" Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen in the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training as cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and Pinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution. Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't seemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous and harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of their internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each on their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts. But something had happened to the exploration party fifteen years back, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check up."}

But the thick clouds that wrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change, it wasn't raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls of fog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forest glowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feeding animals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even the deep gorge where they'd found Hennessy's carefully buried ship was completely hidden by the fog. There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animals now, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute, trying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them.... But there was no time. Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load of deep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any sign of Hennessy. He'd been here a week longer than he should have stayed already. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happened to the men who'd deserted their ship and its equipment, he'd have to report back. He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn't exposed enough of the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air by luck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectors originally. \"Bob!\" Jane Corey's voice cut through his pondering. \"Bob, there are the kids!\" Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caught his eye. The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantastic speed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something that moved there. He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, just beyond the movement he'd seen through the mist. Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground. Something began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, but Gwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets. They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them. Young Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together. Then the mists cleared. Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets. Shaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almost eight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuited cadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was a momentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning the others forward."}

{"chunk_id": "Spawning_Ground_3#0", "contents": "\"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of the little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was agonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door back at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in confusion. But someone was taking over now—one of the crew women. The jeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and Gwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back. There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was irritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to the seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the jeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked up speed. The other two followed. There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them; surrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked horrible in a travesty of manhood. The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were racing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung about, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty miles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in spite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived downward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists. \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to leave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the kids. But it was too late to go back. The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into a gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he had to slow as the fog thickened lower down. Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own trail to confuse the pursuers. There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a glimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse faces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the windshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the steering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone. The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The other jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late to help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or the horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog. A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne. He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature seemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off. Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward against the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot leader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet"}

Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his hands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his nose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after the captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy sound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no further move, though it was still breathing. Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli was either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to kick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded onto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster on another before heading back. \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook his own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing. \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live—and you're detailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign language or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy and why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the answer.\" Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien metabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat sickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still makes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was no sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\" \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get anything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying our time here already.\" The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been picked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were busy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon as he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less informative with retelling. If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save time and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That was almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed to be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had been overcome by the aliens. It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the primitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its fuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told these creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a little more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship cunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work. Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find something—and find it fast.

{"chunk_id": "Spawning_Ground_5#0", "contents": "The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons into a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to prevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found a drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life there to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own. But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had finally proved that the sun was going to go nova. It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go—but it would render the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive, man had to colonize. And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The explorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the terraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships began filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve space. Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and four more months back. In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the footholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some of the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none would be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was precious as a haven for the race. If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as it now seemed, no more time could be wasted here. Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to strip them of their world, but the first law was survival. But how could primitives do what these must have done? He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of cemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully laminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human hand had been able to do for centuries. \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered. Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can see a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested. He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were squatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship. They were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what? For the return of their leader—or for something that would give the ship to them? Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\" Barker's voice sounded odd. \"Physically fine. You can see him. But—\" Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore at Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not checking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices. There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling sound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker seemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in."}

There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling sound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker seemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in. The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The thick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make some kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up unerringly toward the device on the officer's cap. \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said."}
{"chunk_id": "Spawning_Ground_6#0", "contents": "\"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\" Barker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was taut with strain. The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on its head. It was the golden comet of a captain. \"He never meant to hurt the kids—just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in quickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very well. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds fit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it gets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\" Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize on the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little English, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend. \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest kid's dog have? How many were brown?\" The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the curiously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment spread out. Three. Seven. Zero. The answers were right. By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the twisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a long time telling. When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in silence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it possible, Doc?\" \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not by what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under the microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about their kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be a hereditary change—the things that affect the body don't change the germ plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe the fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\" Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped down to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of monsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as tall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high. The kids of the exploring party...."}
{"chunk_id": "Spawning_Ground_7#0", "contents": "Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers, set the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgle as the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto the ground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to the ship again. He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd had time to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept, however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting off giving the gist of it to Jane. \"It was the blobs,\" he summarized it. \"They seem to be amused by men. They don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessy doesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came, all life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen. \"And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside the hull. It doesn't show yet—but we're changed. In another month, Earth food would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeper this time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colony where three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll never know.\" Nobody would know. Their children—odd children who matured in eight years—would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earth tools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed. Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the new eyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world. She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what must now be her home. Then she sighed. \"You'll need practice, but the others don't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'll believe it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really been changed yet, have we?\" \"No,\" he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. \"No. They have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.\" She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was only puzzlement in her face. \"Why?\" And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her the same answer he had found for himself. \"The spawning ground!\" It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant her seed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preserve that seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already were becoming uncertain. Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead of men having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strange children of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek back to civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhaps some of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next rise to culture a better one. \"We're"}

But perhaps some of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next rise to culture a better one. \"We're needed here,\" he told her, his voice pleading for the understanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. \"These people need as rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength. The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them with a decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe or accept the idea—or even let us come back. We have to stay here.\" She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. \"Be fruitful,\" she whispered. \"Be fruitful and spawn and replenish an earth.\" \"No,\" he told her. \"Replenish the stars.\" But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait. Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanes again, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, they could adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead them through all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyond numbering. Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for the children of men!"}

HARNESS Two mighty metal globes clung in a murderous death-struggle, lashing out with flames of poison. Yet deep in their twisted, radioactive wreckage the main battle raged—where a girl swayed sensuously before her conqueror's mocking eyes. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1949. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] At first there was only the voice, a monotonous murmur in her ears. \" Die now—die now—die now —\" Evelyn Kane awoke, breathing slowly and painfully. The top of the cubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a rib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of knowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it. For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly. \" Die now—die now—die now —\" The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and it was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great battle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this tiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain her countrymen had either definitely won—or lost. The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had expected nothing else. She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would set in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe, and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless grave of space. But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon immediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily over the memories of her past. For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched The Defender grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized battle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian globe, The Invader , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding Terran Confederacy, The Defender was unfinished, half-equipped, and undermanned. The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle. The Defender , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled itself from its orbit around Procyon and met The Invader with giant fission torpedoes. And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men poured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken Defender . The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal and terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the Scythians nine years to conquer The Defender's outer shell. Then had come that final interview with her father. \"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had telepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave The Defender .

Be on it.\" \"No. I shall die here.\" His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then die usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will destroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are successful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the battle.\" \"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're also working on a means for your escape—not only because you are Gordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent radio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with our secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\" \"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle finality. She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched herself back to the present. That time had come. With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on the floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with both hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo fissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the ship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing would she die. She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in dismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds and was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle had been terrific. With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined the interior of the box. It was a shattered ruin."}
{"chunk_id": "Stalemate_In_Space_2#0", "contents": "Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing hard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best, finding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the interval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that clutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis. She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space. Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still intact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself, set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were unsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian enemies. Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly. The cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the chaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform. Then she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the sealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on the side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly to her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve of her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring the surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she was alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the cubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling from her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle to come would be her apparent harmlessness. Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born Scythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that of a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black stumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had supplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector. The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and evidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question: Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two months since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot. Yes, he would shoot. Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously, hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With satisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind of the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up behind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first. He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards, he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on. Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway. Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved faster, though still trying to approach quietly.

The man moved faster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in the mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He was not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly onward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches, thinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards in this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and the dull light in his brain went out. She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling. Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from behind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man. For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite effective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped the odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam power down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While he bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the beam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at least, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of a woman. II The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him. \"Name?\" \"Evelyn Kane.\" The eyes of the inquisitor widened. \"So you admit to a Terran name. Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply lorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry corporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally, where is the corporal? Did you kill him?\" He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have the guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a way, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran class. No—he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford another woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with this cool murderess. \"Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the corporal?\" He leaned impatiently over his desk. The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The guards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was their custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice. She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the inquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three. \"If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the guards out for a few minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on her hip. \"I have interesting information.\" So"}

Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he could take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the guards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one another. Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib gingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He would certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut short with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind greater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the recorder. \"Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,\" she asked tersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned. \"Perat, Viscount of Tharn,\" replied the man mechanically. \"What is the extent of his jurisdiction?\" \"From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles radius.\" \"Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.\" The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a seal at its bottom. \"You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following: 'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'\" The man's pen scratched away obediently. Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor. She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse. \"Call the guards,\" she ordered. He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered. \"This person is no longer a prisoner,\" said the inquisitor woodenly. \"She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of Zone One.\" When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any memory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the recording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully, and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for auditing."}
{"chunk_id": "Stalemate_In_Space_3#0", "contents": "Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended from the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly be high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a similar ability in a mere clerk. Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings were still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either shot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of radiation-remover was everywhere. She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire. \"What is that?\" she asked the transport attendant. \"The Commandant is shooting prisoners,\" he replied laconically. \"Oh.\" \"Where did you want to go?\" \"To the personnel office.\" \"That way.\" He pointed to the largest building of the group—two stories high, reasonably intact. She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there with dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and was admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed her stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene coughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick. A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered something to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her. In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn frowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under certain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy. The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some sort, who was studying her visa. \"I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria—ah—\"—he looked at the visa suspiciously—\"S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to S'ria Gerek, here\"—he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back—\"I wish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether they want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to H.Q.?\" She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given some answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It would have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in his eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had combed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring the narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided yellow hair. He was studying her covertly. \"The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,\" she said simply. \"I was told that you , that is, I mean—\" \"Yes?\" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate loudly into her mechanical transcriber. Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort, managed a delicate flush. \"I meant to say, I thought I would be happier working for—working here. So I asked for a transfer.\" S'ria Gorph beamed. \"Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet, you know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we cut loose from the enemy"}

But you do your work well\"—winking artfully—\"and I'll see that—\" He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and anxiety. He appeared to listen. Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was certain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The chances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length of time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all possible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen personal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in the lowly employees that amused Gorph. Gorph looked at her uncertainly. \"Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns, sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.\" He pointed to a hallway. \"All the way through there, across to the other wing.\" As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and calculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could feel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that the Faeg had ceased firing."}
{"chunk_id": "Stalemate_In_Space_4#0", "contents": "Her heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt a very strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild interest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers in the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception of Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he would let her dance for him. The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath for long. Perat was merely amused at her \"lie\" to his under-supervisor. He had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false memories. She opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on the balustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence. The five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as were most of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could be seen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner of his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his abdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely cut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings—apparently identical—on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness and unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an unnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic of a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel pleasures. In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her appraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe was there awaiting it. \"You are right,\" he said coldly, still staring into the court below. \"Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.\" He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. \"Take this.\" He had not as yet looked at her. She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered her and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly twenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood. Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank—was left standing. His arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the killer above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their eyes met, and he started imperceptibly. Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was white, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could be no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane. Her father. The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment that she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream. A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his eyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read bedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.

A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his eyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read bedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures. An icy, amused voice came through: \"Our orders are to kill all prisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It warms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.\" Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was explaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because all captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own men, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not relegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his underlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of that contempt. His next words did not surprise her. \"It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill them. You are shuddering you know?\" She nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat dropped from it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill the Commandant and save her father for a little while. But then the problem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved more quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the contrary if she could get him interested in her— \"So far as our records indicate,\" murmured Perat, \"the man down there is the last living Terran within The Defender . It occurred to me that our newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The Faeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's eyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other nights—\" The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted the ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully, without expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling. Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised the gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed the trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground, face up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead. The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first with amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes. \"Come here,\" he ordered. The Faeg dropped from her hand.

With a titanic effort she activated her legs and walked toward him. He was studying her face very carefully. She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that she had to lean on the coping. With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung over her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the mentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created for her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be thinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar completely. He dropped his hand. \"I'm sorry,\" he said with a quiet weariness. \"I shouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.\" Then: \"Have you ever seen me before?\" \"No,\" she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact. \"Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?\" \"No.\" \"Do you have a son?\" \"No.\" His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back, surveying the courtyard and the dead. \"Gorph will be wondering what happened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.\" Apparently he suspected nothing. Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon. III Perat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple terif and following the thinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floated from his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's club somewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly on tiptoe. For the last thirty \"nights\"—the hours allotted to rest and sleep—it had been thus. By \"day\" she probed furtively into the minds of the office staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official messages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews. By night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, nor his probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult to elude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blotted out memory and knowledge. \"Enough for now,\" he ordered. \"Careful of your rib.\" When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first night, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed floor, and of falling. Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own couch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel of metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur stereop projector.

He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel of metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur stereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been installed in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them waited in the dark, breathing rather loudly. Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some two feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a woman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through a luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily. Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy were complete strangers. But the woman—! \"That is Phaen, my father,\" said Perat quietly. \"He stayed at home because he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on Tharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general resemblance to the Tharn line. \"But— can you deny that you are the woman ?\" The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark. \"There seemed to be some similarity—\" she admitted. Her throat was suddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know the woman. The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the room, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling scowl. \"Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar identical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!\" Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but her mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled in her plan for destruction. She must make it a known quantity. \"Did your father send it to you?\" she asked. \"The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, of course.\" \"What did he say about it?\" \"He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and accept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and that—well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about them.\" \"Is that all he said?\" \"That's all, except that he included this ring.\" He pulled one of the duplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her. \"It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my majority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of its kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak, but I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?\" Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring. \"Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?\" murmured Perat. \"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we"}

This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old count was right.\" \"You could be courtmartialed for that.\" \"Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight—an appeal from a death sentence.\" He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and poured another glass of terif . \"Some fool inquisitor can't show proper disposition of a woman prisoner.\" Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. \"Indeed?\" \"The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him alone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who tries for a little extra profit.\" She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The stimulus would almost certainly make him remember. \"I'll wait for you,\" she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in a languorous yawn. \"Very well.\" Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at her. \"On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and the others have gone.\" Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly. \"Perhaps you'd better come,\" insisted Perat. She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly, and then followed him out. This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of perfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually. \"Odd smell,\" commented Perat, wrinkling his nose. \"Odd scent,\" corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about the earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in the use of the \"perfume.\" The adrenalin glands, they had explained, provided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin slowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and blood pressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But there could be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they had pointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly with the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed over-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened persons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals. The question remained—who would be the more frightened, she or the condemned inquisitor? She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was standing stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered the Zone Provost's chambers."}

Alan stopped, puzzled. Two more blasts, quickly together, and the sound of a scream faintly. Frowning, worrying about the sounds, Alan momentarily forgot to watch his step until his foot suddenly plunged into an ant hill, throwing him to the jungle floor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again, for the tenth time, and stood uncertainly in the dimness. From tall, moss-shrouded trees, wrist-thick vines hung quietly, scraping the spongy ground like the tentacles of some monstrous tree-bound octopus. Fitful little plants grew straggly in the shadows of the mossy trunks, forming a dense underbrush that made walking difficult. At midday some few of the blue sun's rays filtered through to the jungle floor, but now, late afternoon on the planet, the shadows were long and gloomy. Alan peered around him at the vine-draped shadows, listening to the soft rustlings and faint twig-snappings of life in the jungle. Two short, popping sounds echoed across the stillness, drowned out almost immediately and silenced by an explosive crash. Alan started, \"Blaster fighting! But it can't be!\" Suddenly anxious, he slashed a hurried X in one of the trees to mark his position then turned to follow a line of similar marks back through the jungle. He tried to run, but vines blocked his way and woody shrubs caught at his legs, tripping him and holding him back. Then, through the trees he saw the clearing of the camp site, the temporary home for the scout ship and the eleven men who, with Alan, were the only humans on the jungle planet, Waiamea. Stepping through the low shrubbery at the edge of the site, he looked across the open area to the two temporary structures, the camp headquarters where the power supplies and the computer were; and the sleeping quarters. Beyond, nose high, stood the silver scout ship that had brought the advance exploratory party of scientists and technicians to Waiamea three days before. Except for a few of the killer robots rolling slowly around the camp site on their quiet treads, there was no one about. \"So, they've finally got those things working.\" Alan smiled slightly. \"Guess that means I owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda for sure. Anybody who can build a robot that hunts by homing in on animals' mind impulses ...\" He stepped forward just as a roar of blue flame dissolved the branches of a tree, barely above his head. Without pausing to think, Alan leaped back, and fell sprawling over a bush just as one of the robots rolled silently up from the right, lowering its blaster barrel to aim directly at his head. Alan froze. \"My God, Pete built those things wrong!\" Suddenly a screeching whirlwind of claws and teeth hurled itself from the smoldering branches and crashed against the robot, clawing insanely at the antenna and blaster barrel.

With an awkward jerk the robot swung around and fired its blaster, completely dissolving the lower half of the cat creature which had clung across the barrel. But the back pressure of the cat's body overloaded the discharge circuits. The robot started to shake, then clicked sharply as an overload relay snapped and shorted the blaster cells. The killer turned and rolled back towards the camp, leaving Alan alone. Shakily, Alan crawled a few feet back into the undergrowth where he could lie and watch the camp, but not himself be seen. Though visibility didn't make any difference to the robots, he felt safer, somehow, hidden. He knew now what the shooting sounds had been and why there hadn't been anyone around the camp site. A charred blob lying in the grass of the clearing confirmed his hypothesis. His stomach felt sick. \"I suppose,\" he muttered to himself, \"that Pete assembled these robots in a batch and then activated them all at once, probably never living to realize that they're tuned to pick up human brain waves, too. Damn! Damn!\" His eyes blurred and he slammed his fist into the soft earth. When he raised his eyes again the jungle was perceptibly darker. Stealthy rustlings in the shadows grew louder with the setting sun. Branches snapped unaccountably in the trees overhead and every now and then leaves or a twig fell softly to the ground, close to where he lay. Reaching into his jacket, Alan fingered his pocket blaster. He pulled it out and held it in his right hand. \"This pop gun wouldn't even singe a robot, but it just might stop one of those pumas.\" They said the blast with your name on it would find you anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast. Slowly Alan looked around, sizing up his situation. Behind him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly. He shuddered. \"Not a very healthy spot to spend the night. On the other hand, I certainly can't get to the camp with a pack of mind-activated mechanical killers running around. If I can just hold out until morning, when the big ship arrives ... The big ship! Good Lord, Peggy!\" He turned white; oily sweat punctuated his forehead. Peggy, arriving tomorrow with the other colonists, the wives and kids! The metal killers, tuned to blast any living flesh, would murder them the instant they stepped from the ship! A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl he'd married just three weeks ago. He still couldn't believe it. It was crazy, he supposed, to marry a girl and then take off for an unknown planet, with her to follow, to try to create a home in a jungle clearing.

Crazy maybe, but Peggy and her green eyes that changed color with the light, with her soft brown hair, and her happy smile, had ended thirty years of loneliness and had, at last, given him a reason for living. \"Not to be killed!\" Alan unclenched his fists and wiped his palms, bloody where his fingernails had dug into the flesh. There was a slight creak above him like the protesting of a branch too heavily laden. Blaster ready, Alan rolled over onto his back. In the movement, his elbow struck the top of a small earthy mound and he was instantly engulfed in a swarm of locust-like insects that beat disgustingly against his eyes and mouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his arms before his face he jumped up and backwards, away from the bugs. As he did so, a dark shapeless thing plopped from the trees onto the spot where he had been lying stretched out. Then, like an ambient fungus, it slithered off into the jungle undergrowth. For a split second the jungle stood frozen in a brilliant blue flash, followed by the sharp report of a blaster. Then another. Alan whirled, startled. The planet's double moon had risen and he could see a robot rolling slowly across the clearing in his general direction, blasting indiscriminately at whatever mind impulses came within its pickup range, birds, insects, anything. Six or seven others also left the camp headquarters area and headed for the jungle, each to a slightly different spot. Apparently the robot hadn't sensed him yet, but Alan didn't know what the effective range of its pickup devices was. He began to slide back into the jungle. Minutes later, looking back he saw that the machine, though several hundred yards away, had altered its course and was now headed directly for him. His stomach tightened. Panic. The dank, musty smell of the jungle seemed for an instant to thicken and choke in his throat. Then he thought of the big ship landing in the morning, settling down slowly after a lonely two-week voyage. He thought of a brown-haired girl crowding with the others to the gangway, eager to embrace the new planet, and the next instant a charred nothing, unrecognizable, the victim of a design error or a misplaced wire in a machine. \"I have to try,\" he said aloud. \"I have to try.\" He moved into the blackness. Powerful as a small tank, the killer robot was equipped to crush, slash, and burn its way through undergrowth.

Powerful as a small tank, the killer robot was equipped to crush, slash, and burn its way through undergrowth. Nevertheless, it was slowed by the larger trees and the thick, clinging vines, and Alan found that he could manage to keep ahead of it, barely out of blaster range. Only, the robot didn't get tired. Alan did. The twin moons cast pale, deceptive shadows that wavered and danced across the jungle floor, hiding debris that tripped him and often sent him sprawling into the dark. Sharp-edged growths tore at his face and clothes, and insects attracted by the blood matted against his pants and shirt. Behind, the robot crashed imperturbably after him, lighting the night with fitful blaster flashes as some winged or legged life came within its range. There was movement also, in the darkness beside him, scrapings and rustlings and an occasional low, throaty sound like an angry cat. Alan's fingers tensed on his pocket blaster. Swift shadowy forms moved quickly in the shrubs and the growling became suddenly louder. He fired twice, blindly, into the undergrowth. Sharp screams punctuated the electric blue discharge as a pack of small feline creatures leaped snarling and clawing back into the night. Mentally, Alan tried to figure the charge remaining in his blaster. There wouldn't be much. \"Enough for a few more shots, maybe. Why the devil didn't I load in fresh cells this morning!\" The robot crashed on, louder now, gaining on the tired human. Legs aching and bruised, stinging from insect bites, Alan tried to force himself to run holding his hands in front of him like a child in the dark. His foot tripped on a barely visible insect hill and a winged swarm exploded around him. Startled, Alan jerked sideways, crashing his head against a tree. He clutched at the bark for a second, dazed, then his knees buckled. His blaster fell into the shadows. The robot crashed loudly behind him now. Without stopping to think, Alan fumbled along the ground after his gun, straining his eyes in the darkness. He found it just a couple of feet to one side, against the base of a small bush. Just as his fingers closed upon the barrel his other hand slipped into something sticky that splashed over his forearm. He screamed in pain and leaped back, trying frantically to wipe the clinging, burning blackness off his arm. Patches of black scraped off onto branches and vines, but the rest spread slowly over his arm as agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh being ripped away layer by layer. Almost blinded by pain, whimpering, Alan stumbled forward. Sharp muscle spasms shot from his shoulder across his back and chest. Tears streamed across his cheeks.

A blue arc slashed at the trees a mere hundred yards behind. He screamed at the blast. \"Damn you, Pete! Damn your robots! Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\" He stepped into emptiness. Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed by the water, the pain began to fall away. He wanted to lie there forever in the dark, cool, wetness. For ever, and ever, and ... The air thundered. In the dim light he could see the banks of the stream, higher than a man, muddy and loose. Growing right to the edge of the banks, the jungle reached out with hairy, disjointed arms as if to snag even the dirty little stream that passed so timidly through its domain. Alan, lying in the mud of the stream bed, felt the earth shake as the heavy little robot rolled slowly and inexorably towards him. \"The Lord High Executioner,\" he thought, \"in battle dress.\" He tried to stand but his legs were almost too weak and his arm felt numb. \"I'll drown him,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown the Lord High Executioner.\" He laughed. Then his mind cleared. He remembered where he was. Alan trembled. For the first time in his life he understood what it was to live, because for the first time he realized that he would sometime die. In other times and circumstances he might put it off for a while, for months or years, but eventually, as now, he would have to watch, still and helpless, while death came creeping. Then, at thirty, Alan became a man. \"Dammit, no law says I have to flame-out now !\" He forced himself to rise, forced his legs to stand, struggling painfully in the shin-deep ooze. He worked his way to the bank and began to dig frenziedly, chest high, about two feet below the edge. His arm where the black thing had been was swollen and tender, but he forced his hands to dig, dig, dig, cursing and crying to hide the pain, and biting his lips, ignoring the salty taste of blood. The soft earth crumbled under his hands until he had a small cave about three feet deep in the bank. Beyond that the soil was held too tightly by the roots from above and he had to stop. The air crackled blue and a tree crashed heavily past Alan into the stream. Above him on the bank, silhouetting against the moons, the killer robot stopped and its blaster swivelled slowly down. Frantically, Alan hugged the bank as a shaft of pure electricity arced over him, sliced into the water, and exploded in a cloud of steam.

Frantically, Alan hugged the bank as a shaft of pure electricity arced over him, sliced into the water, and exploded in a cloud of steam. The robot shook for a second, its blaster muzzle lifted erratically and for an instant it seemed almost out of control, then it quieted and the muzzle again pointed down. Pressing with all his might, Alan slid slowly along the bank inches at a time, away from the machine above. Its muzzle turned to follow him but the edge of the bank blocked its aim. Grinding forward a couple of feet, slightly overhanging the bank, the robot fired again. For a split second Alan seemed engulfed in flame; the heat of hell singed his head and back, and mud boiled in the bank by his arm. Again the robot trembled. It jerked forward a foot and its blaster swung slightly away. But only for a moment. Then the gun swung back again. Suddenly, as if sensing something wrong, its tracks slammed into reverse. It stood poised for a second, its treads spinning crazily as the earth collapsed underneath it, where Alan had dug, then it fell with a heavy splash into the mud, ten feet from where Alan stood. Without hesitation Alan threw himself across the blaster housing, frantically locking his arms around the barrel as the robot's treads churned furiously in the sticky mud, causing it to buck and plunge like a Brahma bull. The treads stopped and the blaster jerked upwards wrenching Alan's arms, then slammed down. Then the whole housing whirled around and around, tilting alternately up and down like a steel-skinned water monster trying to dislodge a tenacious crab, while Alan, arms and legs wrapped tightly around the blaster barrel and housing, pressed fiercely against the robot's metal skin. Slowly, trying to anticipate and shift his weight with the spinning plunges, Alan worked his hand down to his right hip. He fumbled for the sheath clipped to his belt, found it, and extracted a stubby hunting knife. Sweat and blood in his eyes, hardly able to move on the wildly swinging turret, he felt down the sides to the thin crack between the revolving housing and the stationary portion of the robot. With a quick prayer he jammed in the knife blade—and was whipped headlong into the mud as the turret literally snapped to a stop. The earth, jungle and moons spun in a pinwheeled blur, slowed, and settled to their proper places. Standing in the sticky, sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed the robot apprehensively. Half buried in mud, it stood quiet in the shadowy light except for an occasional, almost spasmodic jerk of its blaster barrel. For the first time that night Alan allowed himself a slight smile. \"A blade in the old gear box, eh? How does that"}

For the first time that night Alan allowed himself a slight smile. \"A blade in the old gear box, eh? How does that feel, boy?\" He turned. \"Well, I'd better get out of here before the knife slips or the monster cooks up some more tricks with whatever it's got for a brain.\" Digging little footholds in the soft bank, he climbed up and stood once again in the rustling jungle darkness. \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how Pete could cram enough brain into one of those things to make it hunt and track so perfectly.\" He tried to visualize the computing circuits needed for the operation of its tracking mechanism alone. \"There just isn't room for the electronics. You'd need a computer as big as the one at camp headquarters.\" In the distance the sky blazed as a blaster roared in the jungle. Then Alan heard the approaching robot, crunching and snapping its way through the undergrowth like an onrushing forest fire. He froze. \"Good Lord! They communicate with each other! The one I jammed must be calling others to help.\" He began to move along the bank, away from the crashing sounds. Suddenly he stopped, his eyes widened. \"Of course! Radio! I'll bet anything they're automatically controlled by the camp computer. That's where their brain is!\" He paused. \"Then, if that were put out of commission ...\" He jerked away from the bank and half ran, half pulled himself through the undergrowth towards the camp. Trees exploded to his left as another robot fired in his direction, too far away to be effective but churning towards him through the blackness. Alan changed direction slightly to follow a line between the two robots coming up from either side, behind him. His eyes were well accustomed to the dark now, and he managed to dodge most of the shadowy vines and branches before they could snag or trip him. Even so, he stumbled in the wiry underbrush and his legs were a mass of stinging slashes from ankle to thigh. The crashing rumble of the killer robots shook the night behind him, nearer sometimes, then falling slightly back, but following constantly, more unshakable than bloodhounds because a man can sometimes cover a scent, but no man can stop his thoughts. Intermittently, like photographers' strobes, blue flashes would light the jungle about him. Then, for seconds afterwards his eyes would see dancing streaks of yellow and sharp multi-colored pinwheels that alternately shrunk and expanded as if in a surrealist's nightmare. Alan would have to pause and squeeze his eyelids tight shut before he could see again, and the robots would move a little closer.

Alan would have to pause and squeeze his eyelids tight shut before he could see again, and the robots would move a little closer. To his right the trees silhouetted briefly against brilliance as a third robot slowly moved up in the distance. Without thinking, Alan turned slightly to the left, then froze in momentary panic. \"I should be at the camp now. Damn, what direction am I going?\" He tried to think back, to visualize the twists and turns he'd taken in the jungle. \"All I need is to get lost.\" He pictured the camp computer with no one to stop it, automatically sending its robots in wider and wider forays, slowly wiping every trace of life from the planet. Technologically advanced machines doing the job for which they were built, completely, thoroughly, without feeling, and without human masters to separate sense from futility. Finally parts would wear out, circuits would short, and one by one the killers would crunch to a halt. A few birds would still fly then, but a unique animal life, rare in the universe, would exist no more. And the bones of children, eager girls, and their men would also lie, beside a rusty hulk, beneath the alien sun. \"Peggy!\" As if in answer, a tree beside him breathed fire, then exploded. In the brief flash of the blaster shot, Alan saw the steel glint of a robot only a hundred yards away, much nearer than he had thought. \"Thank heaven for trees!\" He stepped back, felt his foot catch in something, clutched futilely at some leaves and fell heavily. Pain danced up his leg as he grabbed his ankle. Quickly he felt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn the rotten luck, anyway!\" He blinked the pain tears from his eyes and looked up—into a robot's blaster, jutting out of the foliage, thirty yards away. Instinctively, in one motion Alan grabbed his pocket blaster and fired. To his amazement the robot jerked back, its gun wobbled and started to tilt away. Then, getting itself under control, it swung back again to face Alan. He fired again, and again the robot reacted. It seemed familiar somehow. Then he remembered the robot on the river bank, jiggling and swaying for seconds after each shot. \"Of course!\" He cursed himself for missing the obvious. \"The blaster static blanks out radio transmission from the computer for a few seconds. They even do it to themselves!\" Firing intermittently, he pulled himself upright and hobbled ahead through the bush. The robot shook spasmodically with each shot, its gun tilted upward at an awkward angle.

The robot shook spasmodically with each shot, its gun tilted upward at an awkward angle. Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw stars, real stars brilliant in the night sky, and half dragging his swelling leg he stumbled out of the jungle into the camp clearing. Ahead, across fifty yards of grass stood the headquarters building, housing the robot-controlling computer. Still firing at short intervals he started across the clearing, gritting his teeth at every step. Straining every muscle in spite of the agonizing pain, Alan forced himself to a limping run across the uneven ground, carefully avoiding the insect hills that jutted up through the grass. From the corner of his eye he saw another of the robots standing shakily in the dark edge of the jungle waiting, it seemed, for his small blaster to run dry. \"Be damned! You can't win now!\" Alan yelled between blaster shots, almost irrational from the pain that ripped jaggedly through his leg. Then it happened. A few feet from the building's door his blaster quit. A click. A faint hiss when he frantically jerked the trigger again and again, and the spent cells released themselves from the device, falling in the grass at his feet. He dropped the useless gun. \"No!\" He threw himself on the ground as a new robot suddenly appeared around the edge of the building a few feet away, aimed, and fired. Air burned over Alan's back and ozone tingled in his nostrils. Blinding itself for a few seconds with its own blaster static, the robot paused momentarily, jiggling in place. In this instant, Alan jammed his hands into an insect hill and hurled the pile of dirt and insects directly at the robot's antenna. In a flash, hundreds of the winged things erupted angrily from the hole in a swarming cloud, each part of which was a speck of life transmitting mental energy to the robot's pickup devices. Confused by the sudden dispersion of mind impulses, the robot fired erratically as Alan crouched and raced painfully for the door. It fired again, closer, as he fumbled with the lock release. Jagged bits of plastic and stone ripped past him, torn loose by the blast. Frantically, Alan slammed open the door as the robot, sensing him strongly now, aimed point blank. He saw nothing, his mind thought of nothing but the red-clad safety switch mounted beside the computer. Time stopped. There was nothing else in the world. He half-jumped, half-fell towards it, slowly, in tenths of seconds that seemed measured out in years. The universe went black. Later. Brilliance pressed upon his eyes. Then pain returned, a multi-hurting thing that crawled through his body and dragged ragged tentacles across his brain. He moaned. A voice spoke hollowly in the distance. \"He's waking.

Beside him, looking down with a rueful smile, stood a young man wearing space medical insignia. \"Yes,\" he acknowledged the question in Alan's eyes, \"you hit the switch. That was three days ago. When you're up again we'd all like to thank you.\" Suddenly a sobbing-laughing green-eyed girl was pressed tightly against him. Neither of them spoke. They couldn't. There was too much to say.

The picture changed on the illuminated panel that filled the forward end of the shelf on which Michael lay. A haggard blonde woman sprawled apathetically in a chair. \"Rundown, nervous, hypertensive?\" inquired a mellifluous voice. \"In need of mental therapy? Buy Grugis juice; it's not expensive. And they swear by it on Meropé.\" A disembodied pair of hands administered a spoonful of Grugis juice to the woman, whereupon her hair turned bright yellow, makeup bloomed on her face, her clothes grew briefer, and she burst into a fast Callistan clog. \"I see from your hair that you have been a member of one of the Brotherhoods,\" the passenger lying next to Michael on the shelf remarked inquisitively. He was a middle-aged man, his dust-brown hair thinning on top, his small blue eyes glittering preternaturally from the lenses fitted over his eyeballs. Michael rubbed his fingers ruefully over the blond stubble on his scalp and wished he had waited until his tonsure were fully grown before he had ventured out into the world. But he had been so impatient to leave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the Brotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world that had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy. \"Yes,\" he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal behavior, \"I have been a Brother.\" \"Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a Brotherhood?\" his shelf companion wanted to know. \"Trouble over a female?\" Michael shook his head, smiling. \"No, I have been a member of the Angeleno Brotherhood since I was an infant. My father brought me when he entered.\" The other man clucked sympathetically. \"No doubt he was grieved over the death of your mother.\" Michael closed his eyes to shut out the sight of a baby protruding its fat face at him three-dimensionally, but he could not shut out its lisping voice: \"Does your child refuse its food, grow wizened like a monkey? It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.\" \"No, sir,\" Michael replied. \"Father said that was one of the few blessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.\" Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. \"Be careful, young man!\" he warned. \"Lucky for you that you are talking to someone as broad-minded as I, but others aren't. You might be reported for violating a tabu. An Earth tabu, moreover.\" \"An Earth tabu?\" \"Certainly. Motherhood is sacred here on Earth and so, of course, in the entire United Universe.

{"chunk_id": "Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_2#0", "contents": "Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the Lodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe so that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself, with confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all the customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all the other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before that wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing with them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the same laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no differences, and hence no wars. Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years there had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and plenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar systems—injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths of Aldebaran were still trying to add thought to the statute). Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any reason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to retire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive forefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had, perhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the world. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's face upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the past—the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal furnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days? The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged Brother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved your majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why don't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\" Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying the ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because he had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his preparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence."}

The face on the eraser opened its mouth and sang: \"Our pencils are finest from point up to rubber, for the lead is from Yed, while the wood comes from Dschubba.\" \"Is there any way of turning that thing off?\" Michael wanted to know. The other man smiled. \"If there were, my boy, do you think anybody would watch it? Furthermore, turning it off would violate the spirit of free enterprise. We wouldn't want that, would we?\" \"Oh, no!\" Michael agreed hastily. \"Certainly not.\" \"And it might hurt the advertiser's feelings, cause him ego injury.\" \"How could I ever have had such a ridiculous idea?\" Michael murmured, abashed. \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said his companion. \"My name is Pierce B. Carpenter. Aphrodisiacs are my line. Here's my card.\" He handed Michael a transparent tab with the photograph of Mr. Carpenter suspended inside, together with his registration number, his name, his address, and the Universal seal of approval. Clearly he was a character of the utmost respectability. \"My name's Michael Frey,\" the young man responded, smiling awkwardly. \"I'm afraid I don't have any cards.\" \"Well, you wouldn't have had any use for them where you were. Now, look here, son,\" Carpenter went on in a lowered voice, \"I know you've just come from the Lodge and the mistakes you'll make will be through ignorance rather than deliberate malice. But the police wouldn't understand. You know what the sacred writings say: 'Ignorance of The Law is no excuse.' I'd be glad to give you any little tips I can. For instance, your hands....\" Michael spread his hands out in front of him. They were perfectly good hands, he thought. \"Is there something wrong with them?\" Carpenter blushed and looked away. \"Didn't you know that on Electra it is forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare?\" \"Of course I know that,\" Michael said impatiently. \"But what's that got to do with me?\" The salesman was wide-eyed. \"But if it is forbidden on Electra, it becomes automatically prohibited here.\" \"But Electrans have eight fingers on each hand,\" Michael protested, \"with two fingernails on each—all covered with green scales.\" Carpenter drew himself up as far as it was possible to do so while lying down. \"Do eight fingers make one a lesser Universal?\" \"Of course not, but—\" \"Is he inferior to you then because he has sixteen fingernails?\" \"Certainly not, but—\" \"Would you like to be called guilty of—\" Carpenter paused before the dreaded word—\" intolerance ?\" \"No, no, no !\" Michael almost shrieked. It would be horrible for him to be arrested before he even had time to view Portyork. \"I have lots of gloves in my pack,\" he babbled. \"Lots and lots. I'll put some on right away.\""}

The device had been invented by one of the Dschubbans who are, as everyone knows, hoop-shaped. Michael pushed the button marked Gloves A , and a pair of yellow gauntlets slid out. Carpenter pressed his hands to his eyes. \"Yellow is the color of death on Saturn, and you know how morbid the Saturnians are about passing away! No one ever wears yellow!\" \"Sorry,\" Michael said humbly. The button marked Gloves B yielded a pair of rose-colored gloves which harmonized ill with his scarlet tunic and turquoise breeches, but he was past caring for esthetic effects. \"The quality's high,\" sang a quartet of beautiful female humanoids, \"but the price is meager. You know when you buy Plummy Fruitcake from Vega.\" The salesman patted Michael's shoulder. \"You staying a while in Portyork?\" Michael nodded. \"Then you'd better stick close to me for a while until you learn our ways. You can't run around loose by yourself until you've acquired civilized behavior patterns, or you'll get into trouble.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" Michael said gratefully. \"It's very kind of you.\" He twisted himself around—it was boiling hot inside the jet bus and his damp clothes were clinging uncomfortably—and struck his head against the bottom of the shelf above. \"Awfully inconvenient arrangement here,\" he commented. \"Wonder why they don't have seats.\" \"Because this arrangement,\" Carpenter said stiffly, \"is the one that has proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms.\" \"Oh, I see,\" Michael murmured. \"I didn't get a look at the other passengers. Are there many extraterrestrials on the bus?\" \"Dozens of them. Haven't you heard the Sirians singing?\" A low moaning noise had been pervading the bus, but Michael had thought it arose from defective jets. \"Oh, yes!\" he agreed. \"And very beautiful it is, too! But so sad.\" \"Sirians are always sad,\" the salesman told him. \"Listen.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_5#0", "contents": "Michael strained his ears past the racket of the advideo. Sure enough, he could make out words: \"Our wings were unfurled in a far distant world, our bodies are pain-racked, delirious. And never, it seems, will we see, save in dreams, the bright purple swamps of our Sirius....\" Carpenter brushed away a tear. \"Poignant, isn't it?\" \"Very, very touching,\" Michael agreed. \"Are they sick or something?\" \"Oh, no; they wouldn't have been permitted on the bus if they were. They're just homesick. Sirians love being homesick. That's why they leave Sirius in such great numbers.\" \"Fasten your suction disks, please,\" the stewardess, a pretty two-headed Denebian, ordered as she walked up and down the gangway. \"We're coming into Portyork. I have an announcement to make to all passengers on behalf of the United Universe. Zosma was admitted into the Union early this morning.\" All the passengers cheered. \"Since it is considered immodest on Zosma,\" she continued, \"ever to appear with the heads bare, henceforward it will be tabu to be seen in public without some sort of head-covering.\" Wild scrabbling sounds indicated that all the passengers were searching their packs for headgear. Michael unearthed a violet cap. The salesmen unfolded what looked like a medieval opera hat in piercingly bright green. \"Always got to keep on your toes,\" he whispered to the younger man. \"The Universe is expanding every minute.\" The bus settled softly on the landing field and the passengers flew, floated, crawled, undulated, or walked out. Michael looked around him curiously. The Lodge had contained no extraterrestrials, for such of those as sought seclusion had Brotherhoods on their own planets. Of course, even in Angeles he had seen other-worlders—humanoids from Vega, scaly Electrans, the wispy ubiquitous Sirians—but nothing to compare with the crowds that surged here. Scarlet Meropians rubbed tentacles with bulging-eyed Talithans; lumpish gray Jovians plodded alongside graceful, spidery Nunkians. And there were countless others whom he had seen pictured in books, but never before in reality. The gaily colored costumes and bodies of these beings rendered kaleidoscopic a field already brilliant with red-and-green lights and banners. The effect was enhanced by Mr. Carpenter, whose emerald-green cloak was drawn back to reveal a chartreuse tunic and olive-green breeches which had apparently been designed for a taller and somewhat less pudgy man."}
{"chunk_id": "Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_6#0", "contents": "Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. \"I have no immediate business, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you like to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?\" \"Frankly,\" Michael admitted, \"the first thing I'd like to do is get myself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.\" Two small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and scuttled off on six legs apiece. \"Shh, not so loud! There are females present.\" Carpenter drew the youth to a secluded corner. \"Don't you know that on Theemim it's frightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?\" \"But why?\" Michael demanded in too loud a voice. \"What's wrong with eating in public here on Earth?\" Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. \"Hush,\" he cautioned. \"After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or even mention in public, aren't there?\" \"Well, yes. But those are different.\" \"Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian. But the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have accepted the Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violated one of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of the Theemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do unto extraterrestrials as you would be done by.'\" \"But I'm still hungry,\" Michael persisted, modulating his voice, however, to a decent whisper. \"Do the proprieties demand that I starve to death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?\" \"Naturally,\" the salesman whispered back. \"Portyork provides for all bodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located throughout the port, and there must be some on the field.\" After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were watching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and pressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant. \"That's the nearest one,\" Carpenter explained."}
{"chunk_id": "Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_7#0", "contents": "Inside a small, white, functional-looking building unobtrusively marked \"Feeding Station,\" Carpenter showed Michael where to insert a two-credit piece in a slot. A door slid back and admitted Michael into a tiny, austere room, furnished only with a table, a chair, a food compartment, and an advideo. The food consisted of tabloid synthetics and was tasteless. Michael knew that only primitive creatures waste time and energy in growing and preparing natural foods. It was all a matter of getting used to this stuff, he thought glumly, as he tried to chew food that was meant to be gulped. A ferret-eyed Yeddan appeared on the advideo. \"Do you suffer from gastric disorders? Does your viscera get in your hair? A horrid condition, but swift abolition is yours with Al-Brom from Altair.\" Michael finished his meal in fifteen minutes and left the compartment to find Carpenter awaiting him in the lobby, impatiently glancing at the luminous time dial embedded in his wrist. \"Let's go to the Old Town,\" he suggested to Michael. \"It will be of great interest to a student and a newcomer like yourself.\" A few yards away from the feeding station, the travel agents were lined up in rows, each outside his spaceship, each shouting the advantages of the tour he offered: \"Better than a mustard plaster is a weekend spent on Castor.\" \"If you want to show you like her, take her for a week to Spica.\" \"Movid stars go to Mars.\" Carpenter smiled politely at them. \"No space trips for us today, gentlemen. We're staying on Terra.\" He guided the bewildered young man through the crowds and to the gates of the field. Outside, a number of surface vehicles were lined up, with the drivers loudly competing for business. \"Come, take a ride in my rocket car, suited to both gent and lady, lined with luxury hukka fur brought from afar, and perfumed with rare scents from Algedi.\" \"Whichever movid film you choose to view will be yours in my fine cab from Mizar. Just press a button—it won't cost you nuttin'—see a passionate drama of long-vanished Mu or the bloodhounds pursuing Eliza.\" \"All honor be laid at the feet of free trade, but, whatever your race or your birth, each passenger curls up with two dancing girls who rides in the taxi from Earth.\" \"Couldn't we—couldn't we walk? At least part of the way?\" Michael faltered. Carpenter stared. \"Walk! Don't you know it's forbidden to walk more than two hundred yards in any one direction? Fomalhautians never walk.\" \"But they have no feet.\" \"That has nothing whatsoever to do with it.\""}

Tpiu Number Five is the most esteemed aroma on Algedi. It would break the driver's heart if he thought you didn't like it. You wouldn't want to be had up for ego injury, would you?\" \"Of course not,\" Michael whispered weakly. \"Brunettes are darker and blondes are fairer,\" the advideo informed him, \"when they wash out their hair with shampoos made on Chara.\" After a time, Michael got more or less used to Tpiu Number Five and was able to take some interest in the passing landscape. Portyork, the biggest spaceport in the United Universe, was, of course, the most cosmopolitan city—cosmopolitan in its architecture as well as its inhabitants. Silver domes of Earth were crowded next to the tall helical edifices of the Venusians. \"You'll notice that the current medieval revival has even reached architecture,\" Carpenter pointed out. \"See those period houses in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner?\" \"Very quaint,\" Michael commented. Great floating red and green balls lit the streets, even though it was still daylight, and long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whipped out from the most unlikely places. As Michael opened his mouth to inquire about this, \"We now interrupt the commercials,\" the advideo said, \"to bring you a brand new version of one of the medieval ballads that are becoming so popular....\" \"I shall scream,\" stated Carpenter, \"if they play Beautiful Blue Deneb just once more.... No, thank the Wise Ones, I've never heard this before.\" \"Thuban, Thuban, I've been thinking,\" sang a buxom Betelgeusian, \"what a Cosmos this could be, if land masses were transported to replace the wasteful sea.\" \"I guess the first thing for me to do,\" Michael began in a businesslike manner, \"is to get myself a room at a hotel.... What have I said now?\" \"The word hotel ,\" Carpenter explained through pursed lips, \"is not used in polite society any more. It has come to have unpleasant connotations. It means—a place of dancing girls. I hardly think....\" \"Certainly not,\" Michael agreed austerely. \"I merely want a lodging.\" \"That word is also—well, you see,\" Carpenter told him, \"on Zaniah it is unthinkable to go anywhere without one's family.\" \"They're a sort of ant, aren't they? The Zaniahans, I mean.\" \"More like bees. So those creatures who travel—\" Carpenter lowered his voice modestly \"— alone hire a family for the duration of their stay. There are a number of families available, but the better types come rather high. There has been talk of reviving the old-fashioned price controls, but the Wise Ones say this would limit free enterprise as much as—if you'll excuse my use of the expression—tariffs would.\""}

There were few extraterrestrial clocks because most non-humans had time sense, Michael knew, and needed no mechanical devices. \"This,\" said Carpenter, \"is Times Square. Once it wasn't really square, but it is contrary to Nekkarian custom to do, say, imply, or permit the existence of anything that isn't true, so when Nekkar entered the Union, we had to square off the place. And, of course, install the clocks. Finest clock museum in the Union, I understand.\" \"The pictures in my history books—\" Michael began. \"Did I hear you correctly, sir?\" The capes of a bright blue cloak trembled with the indignation of a scarlet, many-tentacled being. \"Did you use the word history ?\" He pronounced it in terms of loathing. \"I have been grossly insulted and I shall be forced to report you to the police, sir.\" \"Please don't!\" Carpenter begged. \"This youth has just come from one of the Brotherhoods and is not yet accustomed to the ways of our universe. I know that, because of the great sophistication for which your race is noted, you will overlook this little gaucherie on his part.\" \"Well,\" the red one conceded, \"let it not be said that Meropians are not tolerant. But, be careful, young man,\" he warned Michael. \"There are other beings less sophisticated than we. Guard your tongue, or you might find yourself in trouble.\" He indicated the stalwart constable who, splendid in gold helmet and gold-spangled pink tights, surveyed the terrain haughtily from his floating platform in the air. \"I should have told you,\" Carpenter reproached himself as the Meropian swirled off. \"Never mention the word 'history' in front of a Meropian. They rose from barbarism in one generation, and so they haven't any history at all. Naturally, they're sensitive in the extreme about it.\" \"Naturally,\" Michael said. \"Tell me, Mr. Carpenter, is there some special reason for everything being decorated in red and green? I noticed it along the way and it's all over here, too.\" \"Why, Christmas is coming, my boy,\" Carpenter answered, surprised. \"It's July already—about time they got started fixing things up. Some places are so slack, they haven't even got their Mother's Week shrines cleared away.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_10#0", "contents": "A bevy of tiny golden-haired, winged creatures circled slowly over Times Square. \"Izarians,\" Carpenter explained \"They're much in demand for Christmas displays.\" The small mouths opened and clear soprano voices filled the air: \"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the Earth to tune their harps of gold. Peace on Earth, good will to men, from Heaven's All-Celestial. Peace to the Universe as well and every extraterrestrial.... Beat the drum and clash the cymbals; buy your Christmas gifts at Nimble's.\" \"This beautiful walk you see before you,\" Carpenter said, waving an expository arm, \"shaded by boogil trees from Dschubba, is called Broadway. To your left you will be delighted to see—\" \"Listen, could we—\" Michael began. \"—Forty-second Street, which is now actually the forty-second—\" \"By the way—\" \"It is extremely rude and hence illegal,\" Carpenter glared, \"to interrupt anyone who is speaking.\" \"But I would like,\" Michael whispered very earnestly, \"to get washed. If I might.\" The other man frowned. \"Let me see. I believe one of the old landmarks was converted into a lavatory. Only thing of suitable dimensions. Anyhow, it was absolutely useless for any other purpose. We have to take a taxi there; it's more than two hundred yards. Custom, you know.\" \"A taxi? Isn't there one closer?\" \"Ah, impatient youth! There aren't too many altogether. The installations are extremely expensive.\" They hailed the nearest taxi, which happened to be one of the variety equipped with dancing girls. Fortunately the ride was brief. Michael gazed at the Empire State Building with interest. It was in a remarkable state of preservation and looked just like the pictures in his history—in his books, except that none of them showed the huge golden sign \"Public-Washport\" riding on its spire. Attendants directed traffic from a large circular desk in the lobby. \"Mercurians, seventy-eighth floor. A group Vegans, fourteenth floor right. B group, fourteenth floor left. C group, fifteenth floor right. D group, fifteenth floor left. Sirians, forty-ninth floor. Female humans fiftieth floor right, males, fiftieth floor left. Uranians, basement....\" Carpenter and Michael shared an elevator with a group of sad-eyed, translucent Sirians, who were singing as usual and accompanying themselves on wemps , a cross between a harp and a flute. \"Foreign planets are strange and we're subject to mange. Foreign atmospheres prove deleterious. Only with our mind's eye can we sail through the sky to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.\" The cost of the compartment was half that of the feeding station; one credit in the slot unlocked the door. There was an advideo here, too: \"Friend, do you clean yourself each day? Now, let's not be evasive, for each one has his favored way. Some use an abrasive and some use oil. Some shed their skins, in a brand-new hide emerging. Some rub with grease put up in tins. For others there's deterging. Some lick themselves to take off grime. Some beat it off with rope. Some cook it away in boiling lime. Old-fashioned ones use soap. More ways there are"}

Nothing too ostentatious, but, on the other hand, you mustn't count credits and ally yourself beneath your station.\" Michael gazed pensively at two slender, snakelike Difdans writhing \"Only 99 Shopping Days Till Christmas\" across an aquamarine sky. \"They won't be permanent?\" he asked. \"The family, I mean?\" \"Certainly not. You merely hire them for whatever length of time you choose. But why are you so anxious?\" The young man blushed. \"Well, I'm thinking of having a family of my own some day. Pretty soon, as a matter of fact.\" Carpenter beamed. \"That's nice; you're being adopted! I do hope it's an Earth family that's chosen you—it's so awkward being adopted by extraterrestrials.\" \"Oh, no! I'm planning to have my own. That is, I've got a—a girl, you see, and I thought after I had secured employment of some kind in Portyork, I'd send for her and we'd get married and....\" \" Married! \" Carpenter was now completely shocked. \"You mustn't use that word! Don't you know marriage was outlawed years ago? Exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is slavery on Talitha. Furthermore, supposing somebody else saw your—er—friend and wanted her also; you wouldn't wish him to endure the frustration of not having her, would you?\" Michael squared his jaw. \"You bet I would.\" Carpenter drew himself away slightly, as if to avoid contamination. \"This is un-Universal. Young man, if I didn't have a kind heart, I would report you.\" Michael was too preoccupied to be disturbed by this threat. \"You mean if I bring my girl here, I'd have to share her?\" \"Certainly. And she'd have to share you. If somebody wanted you, that is.\" \"Then I'm not staying here,\" Michael declared firmly, ashamed to admit even to himself how much relief his decision was bringing him. \"I don't think I like it, anyhow. I'm going back to the Brotherhood.\" There was a short cold silence. \"You know, son,\" Carpenter finally said, \"I think you might be right. I don't want to hurt your feelings—you promise I won't hurt your feelings?\" he asked anxiously, afraid, Michael realized, that he might call a policeman for ego injury. \"You won't hurt my feelings, Mr. Carpenter.\" \"Well, I believe that there are certain individuals who just cannot adapt themselves to civilized behavior patterns. It's much better for them to belong to a Brotherhood such as yours than to be placed in one of the government incarceratoriums, comfortable and commodious though they are.\" \"Much better,\" Michael agreed. \"By the way,\" Carpenter went on, \"I realize this is just vulgar curiosity on my part and you have a right to refuse an answer without fear of hurting my feelings, but how do you happen to have a—er—girl when you belong to a Brotherhood?\" Michael laughed. \"Oh, 'Brotherhood' is merely a generic term. Both sexes are represented in our society.\" \"On Talitha—\" Carpenter began. \"I know,\" Michael interrupted him, like the crude primitive he was"}

Their melancholy howling was getting on his nerves, but in a little while, he told himself, it would be all over. He would be back home, safe with his own kind. \"When our minds have grown tired, when our lives have expired, when our sorrows no longer can weary us, let our ashes return, neatly packed in an urn, to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.\" The advideo crackled: \"The gown her fairy godmother once gave to Cinderella was created by the haute couture of fashion-wise Capella.\" The ancient taxi was there, the one that Michael had taken from the Lodge, early that morning, to the little Angeleno landing field, as if it had been waiting for his return. \"I see you're back, son,\" the driver said without surprise. He set the noisy old rockets blasting. \"I been to Portyork once. It's not a bad place to live in, but I hate to visit it.\" \"I'm back!\" Michael sank into the motheaten sable cushions and gazed with pleasure at the familiar landmarks half seen in the darkness. \"I'm back! And a loud sneer to civilization!\" \"Better be careful, son,\" the driver warned. \"I know this is a rural area, but civilization is spreading. There are secret police all over. How do you know I ain't a government spy? I could pull you in for insulting civilization.\" The elderly black and white advideo flickered, broke into purring sound: \"Do you find life continues to daze you? Do you find for a quick death you hanker? Why not try the new style euthanasia, performed by skilled workmen from Ancha?\" Not any more, Michael thought contentedly. He was going home."}

But he was forgetting one tiny thing—like calls to like. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Peter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but the dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face, trickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop, from his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at a queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow where his eyes had been. There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the blood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great banks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would never come to life again. I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as before: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not changed, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold and alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like the machinery, and like Peter. It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what Peter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic, either. It was just an emptiness—a void that could not be filled by eating or drinking. It was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise than they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for reason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it. But the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore. For the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could not solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within me, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly—something moved on the skin of my cheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly. A tear was trickling down my cheek."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_AVENGER_2#0", "contents": "Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with satisfaction. His dream was perfect; the Citadel was complete, every minutest detail provided for—on paper. In two weeks they would be laying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow, glittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay finished, a living thing. Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining ship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home. In his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second satellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its insatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of laboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the meteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the stern—all the children of his brain. Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of atmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be a laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with the sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant ether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry. A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious of the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still, that thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly, as if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his back. There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring impassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a face, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was blood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled body. For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging eyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved slowly away and was gone. \"Lord!\" he said. He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street somewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a moment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything was normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the world had grown suddenly unreal. One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding from the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the other part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition. It considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and decided that this was probable. Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands were shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the newsbox on his desk, and switched it on. There were flaring red headlines. Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified, of course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be glad that what he had seen was terrible"}

MOON SHIP DESTROYED IN TRANSIT NO COMMUNICATION FROM ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING The item below the last one said: Pacifica, June 7—The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time in fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by R. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part: \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized peoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their depredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized London; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state and in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed reports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends have not seen them. \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that we face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy superior to ourselves in every way . \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours ago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or in any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They have treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might have treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not attacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications, nor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they have done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us, driven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is more intolerable than any normal invasion. \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this challenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives are threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy the Invaders!\" Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the first time. \" Will we?\" he asked himself softly."}

Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to a halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door mechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk. He mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent in the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened far enough to admit him. Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease on her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One blonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well. \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger. Then she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said, \"Darling, what's wrong?\" He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\" She frowned. \"Why, no—Harry and I have been working for thirty-six hours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\" \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\" She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete, you know I haven't one—it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether there's trouble or not. What—\" \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\" \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete—\" \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\" She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then walked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of papers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\" and pressed the stud. A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and suddenly leapt into full brilliance. Lorelei caught her breath. It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by the warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the transport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have been dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there, yes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They disappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a heartbeat they were gone. There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow defiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of flesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those men and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly joined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of helpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more horrible than any cry of agony. \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a strangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the streets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it."}

This isn't like a war, where the noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be any noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about them, so that he can fight them—and then it may not be enough.\" The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared away from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached out to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles tense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating up the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the rest. \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\" \"Yes.\" Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ... forty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted. Then they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone through the solid wall, or simply melted away. The man and woman clung together, waiting. There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and other faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man screamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty gurgle and died, leaving silence again. Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms were jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away from him and started toward the inner room. \"Wait here,\" he mouthed. She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there! Peter! \" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward. There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been cleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down the narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal cages, and paused just short of it. The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the distorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his range of vision."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_AVENGER_5#0", "contents": "Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the broad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His glazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness straight ahead of him. The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin. In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood, paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen. The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were relaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread legs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull grew gradually flatter. When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless puddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it. There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond fear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said in a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\" The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move, but there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering. The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened. \" Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami.... \" The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The ears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips seemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There were lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only the eyes were alive. \" ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom.... \" \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\" \" ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous. \" He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first time he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there, swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled slowly.... \" Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre. \" His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't—Go back!\" The horrible, mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress. His insides writhed to thrust it out. She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the floor. The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold it back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his fingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in the room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_AVENGER_6#0", "contents": "Somebody said, \"Doctor!\" He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei—\" but his mouth only twitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly. He tried again. \"Doctor.\" \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice. He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him; in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted oddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean, starched odor. \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand pressed him back into the sheets. \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\" He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\" \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a very sick man.\" Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked around him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid. \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\" The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He turned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away. Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal stand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of milky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all. In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just before he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't—fool me. It's been more —than three—months.\" He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he kept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it out of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd been in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much sooner. \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained. \"Seeing that assistant of hers—it was enough to knock anybody out, especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with them for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know—you talked a lot. It's a miracle you're alive, and rational.\" \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why I haven't been able to see her.\" Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to take it.

We started digging in six months ago.\" \"But why?\" Peter whispered. Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else has failed.\" Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on after a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms. It didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them.

It was the first time they'd been annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still smoldering.\" \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily. \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be an impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated areas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate enough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other three-quarters will be dead, or worse.\" \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\" Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our last hope, you see.\" \"Our last hope?\" \"Yes. You're a scientist.\" \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the Citadel . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but, maybe , he thought, there's a chance ...."}

It lay there in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than five hundred meters in diameter, where the Citadel was to have been a thousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into the hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled with the latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead, there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to last a lifetime. It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was one other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solid meters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic rays, were gone. A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to the left of the airlock— The Avenger . He stepped away now, and joined the group a little distance away, silently waiting. Lorelei said, \"You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter—\" \"Darling,\" he began wearily. \"Don't throw your life away! Give us time—there must be another way.\" \"There's no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if he could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers. \"Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground, but that's only delaying the end. They still come down here, only not as many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth rate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures: we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now. \"They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're a million years too far back even to understand what they are or where they came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.\" She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her slender body. But he went remorselessly on. \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They make tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes, or a dozen ears—or a better brain. Out of those millions of possible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. We can't fight them , but a superman could. That's our only chance. Lorelei—darling—don't you see that?\" She choked, \"But why can't you take me along?\" He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he said bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos; they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of staying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful. I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die, too. You'd be their murderer.\" Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll come back, Peter.\" He"}

She straightened slowly until he no longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll come back, Peter.\" He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. A line from an old film kept echoing through his head. \" They'll come back—but not as boys !\" We'll come back, but not as men. We'll come back, but not as elephants. We'll come back, but not as octopi."}

We'll come back.... He heard the massive disk sink home, closing him off. Then he sank down on the floor of the airlock and put his head in shaking hands. After a while he roused himself, closed the inner door of the lock behind him, and walked down the long corridor into the control chamber. The shining banks of keys were there, waiting for his touch; he slumped down before them and listlessly closed the contact of the visiplate. He swung its field slowly, scanning for the last time the bare walls of the underground chamber, making sure that all the spectators had retired out of the way of the blast. Then his clawed fingers poised over the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down. Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the heavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one. The energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed smoothly behind him. The last doors, cleverly camouflaged, slipped back into place and then dwindled in the distance. It was done. He flashed on out, past the moon, past Mars, over the asteroid belt. The days merged into weeks, then months, and finally, far out, The Avenger curved into an orbit and held it. The great motors died, and the silence pressed in about him. Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through his flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working its slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes were unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all the mirrors in the ship. The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended animation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to mature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came from the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was hungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly, searching for the million-to-one chance. He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was Earth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its worm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But after a time he ceased even to wonder. And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its eager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning hope...."}

I am the millionth mutation you were searching for.\" His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your brain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve instinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours of work. You are a superman.\" \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms. He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he stood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but little in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled over his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of flesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had a tiny sixth finger on his left hand. He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once accidentally drawn one of my talons across his face. \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so long—keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from you, not telling you, even, about Earth until now—because I had to be sure. But now, the waiting is over. \"They're still there, I'm sure of it—the people, and the Invaders. You can kill the Invaders, Robert.\" He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive knowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we had a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with you. You are completely, coldly logical, just as they are. You can understand them, and so you can conquer them.\" I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\" He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What—what did you say?\" I repeated it patiently. \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an instant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his suffering, but I could recognize it. \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just as the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the things which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are more nearly kin to me than your people.\""}

His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and not my people?\" \"To do so would be illogical.\" He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered. \"No, you don't understand that, either.\" Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\" \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" I said. I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal arrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively want to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well, then we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could not comprehend it. I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with an expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that, somehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened to the end that I knew was inevitable."}

He'd never been there before, yet already he was a fabulous legend—a dire, hateful legend. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an odd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the little winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he could only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets that twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal. One part of his mind said, This is it, this is the fabled city of Mars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends, and I must go down there. Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in the primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and urgent. Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the city before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk, a soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those who came before you. He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic beauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to close them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open, staring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin wail of music reached him, saying, Come into the city, come down into the fabled city . He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal. The rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it touched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the towers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human. His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an instant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red dust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin strap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin. He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his face down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone for an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the sides of the canal and never look back. He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol, and this is not real.\" He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until he could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the canal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his haste."}

He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his haste. He wouldn't look again. The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It told of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and wine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city, waiting for him to claim them. He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head began to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him, beautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks. When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city. When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy gate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried, \"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if it were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound. A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue street. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue leopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew the sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the sword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome of my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it may be set in the records of the dreamers.\" The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric North!\" The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was white. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the Legend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal hat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_2#0", "contents": "When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about him. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music. Yet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man came forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang deafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze. Bring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\" The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took fire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and fear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless feet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed through the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates closed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart hammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and looked behind to be sure he was safe. The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back, Eric North. Come back to the city.\" He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until his fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back. And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you cannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\" and a fear as old as time coursed through his frame. He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings of the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the city.\" And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a city of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and minarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound of the city was a macabre song of hate. He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the beginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it was beautiful again. He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the motion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he stared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat had not entirely failed him after all. He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to call he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when it began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps. And so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the canal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and the canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he was beyond the range of the illusions. And now that his"}

And so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the canal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and the canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he was beyond the range of the illusions. And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem, and to understand something of the nature of the forces against which he had been pitted. The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had failed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised pattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense against illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly to beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and the machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as the illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again. He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city, whatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he had seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they were as ugly as the second city had been. Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the arrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver indirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve North, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he would have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they had blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would be time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left. The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had established base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's face, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again. He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that he could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a swift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\" The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\" wondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note clipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently and began to read. Garve had scrawled: \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down to the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some sort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd better come back. But"}

But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and I'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight down the canal.\" Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently Garve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been so strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest. Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric selected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They were small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed with smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That should be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began walking back to the canal."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_3#0", "contents": "The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a phantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he came again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the wall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same tune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the wall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen wall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city. He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric, you did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled, seeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of his brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that hat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked so hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung away and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city. The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome than ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and Eric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist. Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet someone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from this side of the city.\" Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\" \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\" Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the Bronze? What is this wild fantasy?\" \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called you that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders believe so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy, superstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed them. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\" Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened the explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well armed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled at the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another struggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and escape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\" \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice sharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are looking after us. Don't look back.\" After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready to run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center. The Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice sharpened, \"Now! Run!\" They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther up the street"}

Farther up the street others appeared, cutting off their flight. Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two buildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes. The soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them. Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you value my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike down the street. For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and two men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let him go. Get the other one. The other one.\" Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to converge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in the gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value my life don't use the gun.\" There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken prisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men held his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly, calculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will not come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could hardly hear it. There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's words that these people were superstitious. He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the thin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you so easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips defeat the prophesy?\" There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood, fear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without the use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it out."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_4#0", "contents": "Then one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance with the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now, then we may forget the prophesy.\" The crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the guards, and kill him at once!\" Eric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were alert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed with the pain. The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing gleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before Eric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut downward across Eric's neck. A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a murmur of respect rippled through the crowd. \"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\" Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She was mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and her hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across the fur street that no one had been aware of her presence. She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so that I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me your hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook his arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking, \"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his muscles and began to pull. She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with an energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and the animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of freedom. Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young suppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling back into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent that made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply, oddly happy as they rode. After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the city. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it contrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city. It was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched among enemies. The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\" Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had held her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you again inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\" Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made of a luminous plastic. It had all the"}

It had all the beauty of the great gate door, but a more timeless, more functional beauty. The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council awaits you. Follow me, please.\" Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was obviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the room, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building. Six men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a chair at the base of the T-shaped table. There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric watched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place there. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had lacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously presiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of the elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your identity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some sort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is the judgment of the elders?\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_5#0", "contents": "Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if in satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion, Daughter of the City?\" Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future. She said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\" Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so despised in the city?\" Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the city. This, and other things.\" Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were the elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if there was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the respect the crowd had accorded Nolette. Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the City. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars ran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and gardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it became plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and could build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets. Yet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots destroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for this homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable again. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the building of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a small colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\" \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked. \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet, in caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this, that it translates thought into reality.\" Eric stared. The idea was staggering. \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is necessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting device capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any sort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this material into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused. \"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape. Think strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your mind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\" Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before him. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He drank it, convinced completely. Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\" \"Yes. The time has come.\" \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling beauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building. Kroon said, \"There are difficulties.

Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\" \"Yes. The time has come.\" \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling beauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building. Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to the mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual in areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass. We have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew drunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and greed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong is the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own evilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the beauty they have lost here.\" Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even know of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us, the dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the machine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we build and control the outward appearance of the city. \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient Legend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be destroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that our people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power. The instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze. It is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man would come.\" Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a space man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to protect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield of some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come is inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\" For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric was an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their thought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far flung kind to return.\" Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\" \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If the prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the Legend, you may stay or go as you desire.\" \"My brother, Garve. What about him?\" \"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this building.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his quarters?\""}

But Macklin is exactly what we need for a quick, dramatic test. We've had it if he turns us down.\" \"I know,\" Mitchell said, exhaling deeply. \"Somehow the men with the money just can't seem to understand basic research. Who would have financed a study of cyclic periods of the hedgehog? Yet the information gained from that study is vital in cancer research.\" \"When we prove our results that should be of enough practical value for anyone. But those crummy trustees didn't even leave us enough for a field test.\" Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of his forehead. \"I've been worrying so much about this I've got the ancestor of all headaches.\" Mitchell's blue eyes narrowed and his boyish face took on an expression of demonic intensity. \"Ferris, would you consider—?\" \"No!\" the smaller man yelled. \"You can't expect me to violate professional ethics and test my own discovery on myself.\" \" Our discovery,\" Mitchell said politely. \"That's what I meant to say. But I'm not sure it would be completely ethical with even a discovery partly mine.\" \"You're right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches? Our reputations don't go outside our own fields,\" Mitchell said. \"But now Macklin—\" Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein in the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word \"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether his Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been able to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but looked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The government took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the Ideal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets. For the past seven years Macklin—who was the Advanced Studies Department of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a faster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the nearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew that the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of Ad astra per aspirin .

The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health. Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild stroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was known that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of the headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several weeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen around the campus."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_BIG_HEADACHE_2#0", "contents": "Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the laboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair behind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly. \"Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?\" Ferris demanded, pausing in mid-stride. \"I imagine he will,\" Mitchell said. \"Macklin's always seemed a decent enough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees meetings.\" \"He's always treated me like dirt,\" Ferris said heatedly. \"Everyone on this campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash in their smug faces.\" Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack of scientific detachment. There came a discreet knock on the door. \"Please come in,\" Mitchell said. Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. He looked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell suspected that that was his intention. He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. \"Good of you to ask me over, Steven.\" Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. \"How have you been, Harold?\" Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. \"Fine, thank you, doctor.\" Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. \"Now what's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep the explanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know.\" Mitchell moved around the desk casually. \"Actually, Doctor, we haven't the right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an element of risk.\" The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. \"Now you have me intrigued. What is it all about?\" \"Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches,\" Mitchell said. Macklin nodded. \"That's right, Steven. Migraine.\" \"That must be terrible,\" Ferris said. \"All your fine reputation and lavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearing agony begins, can it?\" \"No, Harold, it isn't,\" Macklin admitted. \"What does your project have to do with my headaches?\" \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said, \"what would you say the most common complaint of man is?\" \"I would have said the common cold,\" Macklin replied, \"but I suppose from what you have said you mean headaches.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_BIG_HEADACHE_3#0", "contents": "\"Headaches,\" Mitchell agreed. \"Everybody has them at some time in his life. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by their headaches.\" \"Yes,\" Macklin said. \"But think,\" Ferris interjected, \"what a boon it would be if everyone could be cured of headaches forever by one simple injection.\" \"I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it would please about everybody else.\" \"Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular pains,\" Mitchell said. \"I see. Are you two saying you have such a shot? Can you cure headaches?\" \"We think we can,\" Ferris said. \"How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?\" Macklin asked. \"I know that much about the subject.\" \"There are a number of different causes for headaches—nervous strain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors, over-indulgence—but there is one effect of all of this, the one real cause of headaches,\" Mitchell announced. \"We have definitely established this for this first time,\" Ferris added. \"That's fine,\" Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. \"And this effect that produces headaches is?\" \"The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain,\" Mitchell said eagerly. \"That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the telencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by an over-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a virus that feeds on pituitrin.\" \"That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean the end of the race as well,\" Macklin said. \"In certain areas it is valuable to have a constriction of blood vessels.\" \"The virus,\" Ferris explained, \"can easily be localized and stabilized. A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral vessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid doesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.\" The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. \"If this really works, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff makes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the migraine. How should I go about removing my curse?\" He reinserted the pipe. \"I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,\" Ferris said. \"Our discovery will work.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_BIG_HEADACHE_4#0", "contents": "\"Will work,\" Macklin said thoughtfully. \"The operative word. It hasn't worked then?\" \"Certainly it has,\" Ferris said. \"On rats, on chimps....\" \"But not on humans?\" Macklin asked. \"Not yet,\" Mitchell admitted. \"Well,\" Macklin said. \"Well.\" He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm. \"Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors from the Army.\" \"We want you,\" Ferris told him. Macklin coughed. \"I don't want to overestimate my value but the government wouldn't like it very well if I died in the middle of this project. My wife would like it even less.\" Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him mouthing the word yellow . \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I know it's a tremendous favor to ask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem. Unless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our studies we can get no more financial backing. We should run a large-scale field test. But we haven't the time or money for that. We can cure the headaches of one person and that's the limit of our resources.\" \"I'm tempted,\" Macklin said hesitantly, \"but the answer is go. I mean ' no '. I'd like to help you out, but I'm afraid I owe too much to others to take the rest—the risk, I mean.\" Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. \"I really would like to take you up on it. When I start making slips like that it means another attack of migraine. The drilling, grinding pain through my temples and around my eyeballs. The flashes of light, the rioting pools of color playing on the back of my lids. Ugh.\" Ferris smiled. \"Gynergen makes you sick, does it, doctor? Produces nausea, eh? The pain of that turns you almost wrong side out, doesn't it? You aren't much better off with it than without, are you? I've heard some say they preferred the migraine.\" Macklin carefully arranged his pipe along with the tools he used to tend it in a worn leather case. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what is the worst that could happen to me?\" \"Low blood pressure,\" Ferris said. \"That's not so bad,\" Macklin said. \"How low can it get?\" \"When your heart stops, your blood pressure goes to its lowest point,\" Mitchell said. A dew of perspiration had bloomed on Macklin's forehead. \"Is there much risk of that?\" \"Practically none,\" Mitchell said. \"We have to give you the worst possibilities. All our test animals survived and seem perfectly happy and contented. As I said, the virus is self-stabilizing. Ferris and I are confident that there is no danger.... But we may be wrong.\" Macklin held his head in both hands. \"Why did you two select me ?\" \"You're an important man, doctor,\" Ferris said. \"Nobody would care if Mitchell or I cured ourselves of headaches—they might not even believe us if we said we did. But the proper authorities will believe a man of your reputation. Besides, neither of us has a record of chronic migraine. You do.\" \"Yes,"}

Give me your injection.\" Mitchell cleared his throat. \"Are you positive, doctor?\" he asked uncertainly. \"Perhaps you would like a few days to think it over.\" \"No! I'm ready. Go ahead, right now.\" \"There's a simple release,\" Ferris said smoothly. Macklin groped in his pocket for a pen. II \"Ferris!\" Mitchell yelled, slamming the laboratory door behind him. \"Right here,\" the small man said briskly. He was sitting at a work table, penciling notes. \"I've been expecting you.\" \"Doctor—Harold—you shouldn't have given this story to the newspapers,\" Mitchell said. He tapped the back of his hand against the folded paper. \"On the contrary, I should and I did,\" Ferris answered. \"We wanted something dramatic to show to the trustees and here it is.\" \"Yes, we wanted to show our proof to the trustees—but not broadcast unverified results to the press. It's too early for that!\" \"Don't be so stuffy and conservative, Mitchell! Macklin's cured, isn't he? By established periodic cycle he should be suffering hell right now, shouldn't he? But thanks to our treatment he is perfectly happy, with no unfortunate side effects such as gynergen produces.\" \"It's a significant test case, yes. But not enough to go to the newspapers with. If it wasn't enough to go to the press with, it wasn't enough to try and breach the trustees with. Don't you see? The public will hand down a ukase demanding our virus, just as they demanded the Salk vaccine and the Grennell serum.\" \"But—\" The shrill call of the telephone interrupted Mitchell's objections. Ferris excused himself and crossed to the instrument. He answered it and listened for a moment, his face growing impatient. \"It's Macklin's wife,\" Ferris said. \"Do you want to talk to her? I'm no good with hysterical women.\" \"Hysterical?\" Mitchell muttered in alarm and went to the phone. \"Hello?\" Mitchell said reluctantly. \"Mrs. Macklin?\" \"You are the other one,\" the clear feminine voice said. \"Your name is Mitchell.\" She couldn't have sounded calmer or more self-possessed, Mitchell thought. \"That's right, Mrs. Macklin. I'm Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. Ferris's associate.\" \"Do you have a license to dispense narcotics?\" \"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said sharply. \"I used to be a nurse, Dr. Mitchell. I know you've given my husband heroin.\" \"That's absurd. What makes you think a thing like that?\" \"The—trance he's in now.\" \"Now, Mrs. Macklin.

Is it so expensive to refine you and Ferris have to recruit new customers to keep yourselves supplied?\" \"Mrs. Macklin! I think I had better talk to you later when you are calmer.\" Mitchell dropped the receiver heavily. \"What could be wrong with Macklin?\" he asked without removing his hand from the telephone. Ferris frowned, making quotation marks above his nose. \"Let's have a look at the test animals.\" Together they marched over to the cages and peered through the honeycomb pattern of the wire. The test chimp, Dean, was sitting peacefully in a corner scratching under his arms with the back of his knuckles. Jerry, their control in the experiment, who was practically Dean's twin except that he had received no injection of the E-M Virus, was stomping up and down punching his fingers through the wire, worrying the lock on the cage. \"Jerry is a great deal more active than Dean,\" Mitchell said. \"Yes, but Dean isn't sick. He just doesn't seem to have as much nervous energy to burn up. Nothing wrong with his thyroid either.\" They went to the smaller cages. They found the situation with the rats, Bud and Lou, much the same. \"I don't know. Maybe they just have tired blood,\" Mitchell ventured. \"Iron deficiency anemia?\" \"Never mind, doctor. It was a form of humor. I think we had better see exactly what is wrong with Elliot Macklin.\" \"There's nothing wrong with him,\" Ferris snapped. \"He's probably just trying to get us in trouble, the ingrate!\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_BIG_HEADACHE_5#0", "contents": "Macklin's traditional ranch house was small but attractive in aqua-tinted aluminum. Under Mitchell's thumb the bell chimbed dum-de-de-dum-dum-dum . As they waited Mitchell glanced at Ferris. He seemed completely undisturbed, perhaps slightly curious. The door unlatched and swung back. \"Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I'm sure we can help if there is anything wrong with your husband. This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr. Mitchell.\" \"You had certainly better help him, gentlemen.\" She stood out of the doorway for them to pass. Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore an expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline. The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them. \"You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized injection,\" he said. It wasn't a question. \"I don't like that 'unauthorized',\" Ferris snapped. The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted a heavy eyebrow. \"No? Are you medical doctors? Are you authorized to treat illnesses?\" \"We weren't treating an illness,\" Mitchell said. \"We were discovering a method of treatment. What concern is it of yours?\" The colonel smiled thinly. \"Dr. Macklin is my concern. And everything that happens to him. The Army doesn't like what you have done to him.\" Mitchell wondered desperately just what they had done to the man. \"Can we see him?\" Mitchell asked. \"Why not? You can't do much worse than murder him now. That might be just as well. We have laws to cover that.\" The colonel led them into the comfortable, over-feminine living room. Macklin sat in an easy chair draped in embroidery, smoking. Mitchell suddenly realized Macklin used a pipe as a form of masculine protest to his home surroundings. On the coffee table in front of Macklin were some odd-shaped building blocks such as were used in nursery schools. A second uniformed man—another colonel but with the snake-entwined staff of the medical corps in his insignia—was kneeling at the table on the marble-effect carpet. The Army physician stood up and brushed his knees, undusted from the scrupulously clean rug. \"What's wrong with him, Sidney?\" the other officer asked the doctor. \"Not a thing,\" Sidney said. \"He's the healthiest, happiest, most well-adjusted man I've ever examined, Carson.\" \"But—\" Colonel Carson protested. \"Oh, he's changed all right,\" the Army doctor answered. \"He's not the same man as he used to be.\" \"How is he different?\" Mitchell demanded. The medic examined Mitchell and Ferris critically before answering. \"He used to be a mathematical genius.\" \"And now?\" Mitchell said impatiently. \"Now he is a moron,\" the medic said. III Mitchell tried to stop Colonel Sidney as he went past, but the doctor mumbled he had a report to make. Mitchell and Ferris stared at Colonel Carson and Macklin and at each other. \"What did he mean, Macklin is an idiot?\" Mitchell asked. \"Not an idiot,\" Colonel Carson corrected primly. \"Dr. Macklin is a moron. He's legally responsible, but he's extremely stupid.\" \"I'm not so dumb,\" Macklin said defensively. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" Carson said. \"I didn't intend any offense. But"}

He turned to the two biologists. \"Perhaps we had better speak outside.\" \"But—\" Mitchell said, impatient to examine Macklin for himself. \"Very well. Let's step into the hall.\" Ferris followed them docilely. \"What have you done to him?\" the colonel asked straightforwardly. \"We merely cured him of his headaches,\" Mitchell said. \"How?\" Mitchell did his best to explain the F-M Virus. \"You mean,\" the Army officer said levelly \"you have infected him with some kind of a disease to rot his brain?\" \"No, no! Could I talk to the other man, the doctor? Maybe I can make him understand.\" \"All I want to know is why Elliot Macklin has been made as simple as if he had been kicked in the head by a mule,\" Colonel Carson said. \"I think I can explain,\" Ferris interrupted. \"You can?\" Mitchell said. Ferris nodded. \"We made a slight miscalculation. It appears as if the virus colony overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum. It isn't more than necessary to stop headaches. But that necessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain cells to function properly.\" \"Why won't they function?\" Carson roared. \"They don't get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin,\" Ferris explained. \"The cerebral vessels don't contract enough to pump the blood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain cells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying.\" The colonel yelled. Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct."}

The capital is replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly once in a human race.\" \"Just a moment,\" Mitchell interrupted, \"we can cure Macklin.\" \"You can ?\" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was going to clasp his hands and sink to his knees. \"Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have antitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a beneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.\" \"Good!\" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the knees. \"Just you wait a second now, boys,\" Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning in the doorway, holding his pipe. \"I've been listening to what you've been saying and I don't like it.\" \"What do you mean you don't like it?\" Carson demanded. He added, \"Sir?\" \"I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.\" \"Yes, doctor,\" Mitchell said eagerly, \"just as you used to be.\" \" With my headaches, like before?\" Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to frame an answer. \"Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions properly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is a dismal failure.\" \"I wouldn't go that far,\" Ferris remarked cheerfully. Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw Macklin slowly shaking his head. \"No, sir!\" the mathematician said. \"I shall not go back to my original state. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying, worrying.\" \"You mean wondering,\" Mitchell said. Macklin nodded. \"Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing. How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say, what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's peaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife and all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?\" Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it. \"That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him,\" Mitchell said. \"It's not his decision to make,\" the colonel said. \"He's an idiot now.\" \"No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron.

She turned as the men approached. \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the colonel began, \"these gentlemen believe they can cure your husband of his present condition.\" \"Really?\" she said. \"Did you speak to Elliot about that?\" \"Y-yes,\" Colonel Carson said, \"but he's not himself. He refused the treatment. He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence.\" She nodded. \"If those are his wishes, I can't go against them.\" \"But Mrs. Macklin!\" Mitchell protested. \"You will have to get a court order overruling your husband's wishes.\" She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. \"That was my original thought. But I've redecided.\" \"Redecided!\" Carson burst out almost hysterically. \"Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put him back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again, where he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy now. Like a child, but happy.\" \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the Army man said levelly, \"if you don't help us restore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order declaring him incompetent.\" \"But he is not! Legally, I mean,\" the woman stormed. \"Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us the edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once he's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and Ferris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin to sanity.\" \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said. The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\" \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is involved.\" \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—\" \"It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of vascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to give those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To paralyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.\" \"I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment there is no chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell interjected. Her mouth grew petulant. \"I don't care. I would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him comfortable....\" Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led him back into the hall. \"I'm no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin stupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life, and now she can dominate him completely.\" \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered. \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous of her husband's genius.\" \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don't know. I don't know what the hell to tell the Pentagon. I think I'll go out and get drunk.\" \"I'll go with you,\" Ferris said. Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.

The colonel shrugged. \"That's as good a reason as any.\" On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together in bewilderment. IV Macklin was playing jacks. He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great curving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto and the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not his head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed \"M\" so it was all the same. Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty. He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his heart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from the nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger. After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer. \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said. Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the phone instead of his wife. \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked. \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\" \"I mean, are you alone?\" \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Army doctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him give me anything, though.\" \"Good boy,\" the biologist said. \"Listen, doctor—Elliot—El, old son. I'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you go back to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me, don't you?\" There was a slight hesitation. \"Sure,\" Macklin said, \"if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?\" \"But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if I could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\" \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly. \"You've found yourself worrying—thinking—about a lot of other problems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind of scientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used to have time to think about.\" \"If you say so.\" \"Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of those worries just as you got rid of the others?\" Mitchell asked. \"I guess I'd like that,\" the mathematician replied. \"Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don't you?\" \"No, I—yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put me back where I was instead of helping me more?\" \"I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!\" \"If you"}

It made a one-night pitch on a Venusian swamp-town—to find that death stalked it from the jungle in a tiny ball of flame. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories May 1943. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He knocked over the pitcher of thil , but it didn't matter. The pitcher was empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not very hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to spring them. \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and down the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\" I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\" \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through a curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says I'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in Space, plastered so thick with attachments....\" \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a lot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey! I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for eleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down! Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\" I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults Buckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face unless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame. Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his grey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian girl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the slanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round toward us, pleased and kind of hungry. I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to Shannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be. I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\" Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter Shannon?\" Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled pleasantly and said, very gently: \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\" I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if he was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon settled his shoulders and hips like a dancer. The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed in dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of grey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully clean.

He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust with their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad. There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale blue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's. He said, \"I don't think you understand.\" I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair back. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I got my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed, and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc. Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand. I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise. It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up, quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed. Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you, Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.\" \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\" The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\" Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at the table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\" The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face stayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start that it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I ever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more than you could see through sheet metal. I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said, \"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\" The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon Beamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Blue_Behemoth_2#0", "contents": "I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh pitcher of thil on the table. Then I cleared my throat. \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\" Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have independent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten the burden of life for those less fortunate....\" Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and started to get up. I kicked him under the table. \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\" He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish ignored him. He went on, quietly, \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of toil and boredom....\" I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\" \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no entertainment of the— proper sort has been available. I propose to remedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\" Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to speak, and I kicked him again. \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel several engagements....\" He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said, \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\" The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I glared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes. It was Gow, our zoo-man—a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran colony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the scenery—scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the curtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger than the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino. He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\" \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\" Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude ain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\" I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\" He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to fit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome, see? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot ship'll hold her.\" He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish cleared his throat and said, rather stiffly, \"Gertrude?\" \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I finished for him. \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp Venusian cansin . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt Brothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\" She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that.

Gertrude may be a little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she wouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking circus than even I could stand. Beamish looked impressed. \"A cansin . Well, well! The mystery surrounding the origin and species of the cansin is a fascinating subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\" We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have at least a hundred U.C.'s.\" It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker. Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my stomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly. \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be agreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled off half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table. \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in the morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\" We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made grab for the money, but I beat him to it. \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs. Here.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We can get lushed enough on this.\" Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back he said suddenly, \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\" \"Yeah.\" \"It may be crooked.\" \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I yelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\" Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic where the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He poked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More thildatum !\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Blue_Behemoth_3#0", "contents": "It was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where Shannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late as it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting around and smoking and looking very ugly. It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless under the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead and dried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown red dust gritted in my teeth. Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to the roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his feet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\" They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I grinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more than money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out of his own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in weeks we'd come in at the front door. I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly, Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts. Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily. \"Now?\" he said. \"Now,\" I said. We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join in. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went home happy. They had their money, and we had their blood. The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the green girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the muscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers and joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the passageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings. Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose. \"They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I've rewarded them.\" I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed. \"Let's go see Gertrude.\" I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going into the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a city guy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But Bucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged. \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\" \"You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....\" The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall down the ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't.... Oh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends? It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was a dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand.

We started down the long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and compression units. Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn't near as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It's the smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them, breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled around them as strong as the cage bars. Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and then wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again. A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell, ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall. It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same time. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I could think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a great metallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow had them nicely conditioned to that gong."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Blue_Behemoth_4#0", "contents": "But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel them inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of them. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought—like I wanted to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night, all of a sudden.... Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She's gettin' worse,\" he said. \"She's lonesome.\" \"That's tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an owl's. He swayed slightly. \"That's sure tough.\" He sniffled. I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a deep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a cansin . There's only two of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will make much difference. They're what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old Dame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The cansins were pretty successful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and now there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even the Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils. I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck some place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little bird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big. I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage with her hands—yeah, hands—hanging over her knees and her snaky head sunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything. Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire. The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the mane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began. Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\" Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow! Nobody's ever seen a male cansin . There may not even be any.\" Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head. The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain.... Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You'll have to snap her out of this, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.\" He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he turned to Gertrude. \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak's wreck and everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know her. I can do things with"}

But this time....\" He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a woman's talking about a sick child. \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain't sure.\" \"Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need her.\" I took Shannon's arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.\" He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at us. Bucky sobbed. \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But it's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with Gertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\" \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\" We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller. Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly with blue, cold fire. I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God's sake!\" I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all I could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream. I thought, \" Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wants to kill us! \" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I sobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me. One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I rolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the hollow of his shoulder. The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the back of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my mouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes. Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking, \"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!\" Then I went out.

You funny like hell!\" I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the washstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch plaid. I felt sick. Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was a big burn across his neck. He said: \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\" I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\" Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door. \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in. Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\" I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far. Nobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head. \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\" \"Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.\" \"One hundred U.C.'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge mining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\" I shrugged. \"You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off the creditors.\" \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn't a comfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign.\" He put his hand on the latch and looked at my feet. \"And—uh—Jig, I....\" I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!\" We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge, and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking like a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian strong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had kittens. Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. It lived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out of their pants. Circus people are funny that way. Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.

It didn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at dinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I was ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute. Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our itinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It was Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a bunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle of it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look. I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and our router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned. \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\" I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and went out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they weren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus heat was already sneaking into the ship. While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude, screaming."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Blue_Behemoth_5#0", "contents": "The canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in the mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I stood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking. I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was standing in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her triangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn't have anything on but her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn't sound nice. You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with the electric power they carry in their own bodies. They're Venusian middle-swampers, they're not human, and they never forget it. Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with white reptilian teeth. \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can smell it in the swamp wind.\" The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under her jaw pulsed like a toad's, and her eyes were red. \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken. They are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\" She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight and cold. Bucky said, \"Let's eat if they have a bar in this dump.\" We weren't half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing field when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We could see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd. He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or four tries to get our names out clear enough to understand. Bucky said, \"Jig—it's Sam Kapper.\" We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled around to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man who crawled and whimpered in the mud. Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and carnivals. He'd given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren't too broke, and we were pretty friendly. I hadn't seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed, hard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick, looking down at him. Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over like animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him. I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I only caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't realize until later that he looked familiar. We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled the curtain in a lot of curious faces.

{"chunk_id": "The_Blue_Behemoth_6#0", "contents": "Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's. He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it and brought it out.\" The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help me,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled. \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's got to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they wouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\" He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know how they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back. I've got to....\" Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared, suddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\" Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper grabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands stood out like guy wires. \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you—where it is. Got to take it back. Promise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his breathing. \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\" Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for air. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no use. Kapper whispered, \" Cansin . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\" \"Where is it, Sam?\" I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish was standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper made a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table. Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt Kapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew. \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally. \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\" I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at Beamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and pushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap. \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said. Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I told him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked over to the bar. I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the place. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch of miners in dirty shirts and high boots. Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never did any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else. The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place.

When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that globe-shaking mystery—the fabulous Room of The Dreaming. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive, Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way with the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been occasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up. Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet? On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to Johnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain that came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the notes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room. Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses, perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly love. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both humans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with straight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him, aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear. Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson entered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed that he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to recognize Caldwell. \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice was all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a headwaiter was bowing to him. \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams tonight?\" \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself will be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite his touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands in a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do ze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger hisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers. \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise, just the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does the dreaming commence?\" \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty one?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson to the bar. \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\" \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light, admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it."}

Johnson was at the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson said. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light, admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him, watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking itself. \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right. A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut very low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on Earth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue, the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and below the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons. Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the days of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this place where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes smiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here in this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar stool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were here who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that circled it? \"They are beautiful,\" he said, smiling. \"Thank you.\" \"I was referring to the bubbles.\" \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed. \"How did you know? I mean....\" \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling. \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\" For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then it came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\" Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his nose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered. \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no doubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is Vee Vee.\" \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\" \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\" \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\" \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_CONJURER_of_VENUS_2#0", "contents": "\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\" \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid. Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in the employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then his purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his purpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman on him. There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back. In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned the motives of the killer. \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee said. \"Not any longer,\" he laughed. \"You have decided them?\" \"Yes.\" \"Every last one of them?\" \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on the periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to them.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden behind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased himself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell. \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have zlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was thick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out of the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The fingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood. \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I think he is, or was, here.\" \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How—\" \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered. \"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar. \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching Caldwell. \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him—\" \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the merriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold. \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was bowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\" \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see the dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we darling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow. \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the moment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might be something else. And he might be there. \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of sight. \"Say, I want to know more—\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The"}

Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter clutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of sight. \"Say, I want to know more—\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in a blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden silence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes were blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet, cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer. In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians and humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation of what was to happen. The trumpets flared again. On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From beyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that sounded like lutes from heaven. Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with her. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging into his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost paralyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the tips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder. She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to the thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his elbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing it, she began to massage it. \"You—you—\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first man I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\" \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\" \"But—\" \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp at her side and tucked it into his elbow. \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he said. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it. \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same mistake twice.\" \"Good,\" Johnson said. \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said. \"What a sweet, charming child you—\" \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\" \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you interrupt.\" She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to say she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He tensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of her fingers she gently patted his arm. \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get you than by using the Karmer grip.\" \"What way?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered. \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\" \"Eve's daughters don't use apples"}

Come along.\" Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming, Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's face was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning signs. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his arm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming. II It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps rising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been a stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an open space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps the room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian werewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps. The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The throbbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were playing. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became accustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human minds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had the feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain would have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms. The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending tingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the Dreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching hold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but he had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever did. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold. In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center inside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some radiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the coldness now. Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm. \"Do you feel it, darling?\" \"Yes.\" \"What is it?\" \"How would I know?\" \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\" \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\" \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he is incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it. \"But—\" \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip and be able to break it instantly?\" \"Hell—\" \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations"}

If you could break it, then there was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on. \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound. \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last thing you really want to do.\" He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into this room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back to her. Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with me.\" A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But—but—\" His voice was suddenly weak. The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am I not with you?\" \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a choice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they were—his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the balance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin—But Caldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What connection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here? Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on a ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to another nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved cushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way that was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the left. \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still thick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under the man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit gun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling his own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of gas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in operation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of seconds. True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next day. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as effective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them.

The feel of the little weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him. The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely through the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright spotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant illumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The curtain rose."}
{"chunk_id": "The_CONJURER_of_VENUS_3#0", "contents": "Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light. Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers sought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He caught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened and became a rock. Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light had been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the impassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three hundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe that would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the spotlight as if by magic. Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How—\" \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\" No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin— Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound passed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself flat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently went to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest take on the even, regular rhythm of sleep. The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers dug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for protection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She drew closer to him. A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able to take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was suddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she had suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection. \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered. \"N—o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\" Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer lay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his breath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting—for what? The whole situation was senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he sensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this way, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these Rooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself was not prepared to disagree. Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ... going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience to them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly. The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep, perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music and the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.

It was this something else that sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium smokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance. He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ... watching a space ship float in an endless void . As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into his vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer, the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and Caldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not in the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he knew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out on the periphery of his universe, perhaps of the universe. All he saw was the space ship. It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen in his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him. Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off stars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his destiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was this night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern. The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and thrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now he was making contact with a vision that belonged to time. He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm. \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who was Vee Vee? The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship vanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room, at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot. \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on his arm. \"But, didn't you see it?\" \"See what?\" \"The space ship!\" \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep. \"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact with my dream.\" \"Your dream?\" He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling, and look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of sound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left told him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The Venusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had not heard it before in this place.

A slow languorous beat of hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a high-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had not heard it before in this place. He thought about the space ship he had seen. The vision would not come. He shook his head and tried again. Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a woman in love. He tried again for the space ship. It would not come. Anger came up instead. Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept intruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision. So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not dreaming, who was not in a state of trance. His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer.... Cold flowed over him. Unger was slowly rising from the mat. The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward! III An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here and there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting him. \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to Venus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence. Another voice took its place. \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ... this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian Dreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity, can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\" \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening. We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian Buddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\" \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said. \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our master saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some other sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\" \"I—\" Johnson whispered. \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\" \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\" \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\" \"I am your thyroid. I....\" A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if the parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to him what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days when he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them. \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly. The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action, Master! Do something.\" \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered. \"But hurry. We are excited.\" \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,"}

In this situation, if action is taken before the time for it—if that time ever comes—we can all die.\" \"Die?\" the chorus quavered. \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go together.\" The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the little voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures. \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported. \"Please!\" Johnson said. In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor. \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated. \"I sweat....\" his skin began. \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said. The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see them. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that force. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated. \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a Venusian being jarred out of his dream. \"Damn it!\" A human voice said. A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room. Unger fell. He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking, body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard. There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The silence went. Voices came. \"Who did that?\" \"What happened?\" \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked the voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the meaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At his left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What—what happened? I was back in the lab on Earth—\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as if some pleasant dream had been interrupted. On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up around his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came hungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away. \"What—\" he gasped. \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\" Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back of the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of Venusians were attacking a man. \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He is here!\" In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired blindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft throb of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.

She had slid out of his sight. \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout. \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important one.\" Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went. Johnson followed."}

Sun-blasted by day, cold-wracked by night—and life condensed by radiation into eight days! Sim eyed the Ship—if he only dared reach it and escape! ... but it was more than half an hour distant—the limit of life itself! [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1946. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] During the night, Sim was born. He lay wailing upon the cold cave stones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He grew, steadily. Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The nightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew alert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright, insistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked about, blindly. There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared. And a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying face. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was crouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of his face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen night planet. Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim pebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern entrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger, larger. The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were all that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his withered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless. Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the tunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die. Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their faces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One minute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The next minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred. Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed him, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her husband to rise again. With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the cave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her grasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist lungs! With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave. The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised. It was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still in his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants questions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended, ready to destroy him.

It was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still in his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants questions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended, ready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the dying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's new, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a newborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It was impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour now. And in the next instant perhaps dead! His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the weapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their conflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing harshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\" \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was, stretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon. \"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than us, and be young!\" The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring, eyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A girl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to procure food. His sister. The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up, weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth trembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her husband. \"Leave my children alone.\" The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone crib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of her life's over, already,\" he gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\" As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured, smoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles. She was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling the knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the tunnel, was aging, dying. Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to meet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his sister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers. He relaxed somewhat. He began to learn. The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the child,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our last day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\" Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him. This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the days were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The people lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of flame.

Make him grow.\" Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him. This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the days were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The people lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of flame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong, and then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony, barren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset the day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable temperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns; all life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly, birds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal life rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get its living down in the brief hour of respite. It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours after birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire life in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone channels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep never, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping. And he would live exactly eight days."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_CREATURES_THAT_TIME_FORGOT_2#0", "contents": "The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight short days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his mother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed rapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly. Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence was a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age an inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty. Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his father now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child. This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every second of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge. Because in a few hours they'd be dead. This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal state hadn't he dreamed of long lives, valleys not of blasted stone but green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then there must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long life? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and depressing in eight short, vanishing days? How had his people gotten into such a condition? As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across space from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women. When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs from the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the huge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon a forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened, two hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins thickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were born in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this world's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a week, leaving children to do likewise. So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for he knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a telepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five thousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself from dying eight days from now? Is there escape? His eyes widened, another image came to focus. Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect, unscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the avalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship of all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But it was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on the far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was his only hope of escape. His mind flexed. In this cliff, deep"}

This ship, then, on the far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was his only hope of escape. His mind flexed. In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful of scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he must go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys and temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant ship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or age. The cliff groaned. Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face. \"Dawn's coming,\" he said. II Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of the Avalanche. The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with eager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard a rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley. Stones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for a million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their journey as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a thousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets. Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour. The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to their lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous. Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down the tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There was a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He sensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried, bringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she cried to her husband. Sim felt his father crouch, listening. High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering. \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out. An avalanche fell down at them! Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His mother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging. With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The avalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and Dark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders that weighed a hundred pounds each. The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand. Sim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it alive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\" Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her husband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\" \"I may yet,\" retorted the father. Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an avalanche afront"}

She cursed her husband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\" \"I may yet,\" retorted the father. Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an avalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from under a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing else to be seen. Someone else had lost the game. Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain. The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven was a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor the bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining stars. This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent temperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and its life moved abroad. Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his people find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why. The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing in the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It flowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks. Seconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips. Father gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile crop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at his waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's tongue. His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge thirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage, selfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One thing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind like a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for explanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden of food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like a bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit, complete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew excited with his ability."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_CREATURES_THAT_TIME_FORGOT_3#0", "contents": "They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells, watching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like scurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing: \"Remember?\" Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember when they'd lived only seven days! The husband and wife looked at each other. \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her eyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She sobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips. The wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago it was you!\" \"An hour is half a life.\" \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because it will be our last looking.\" \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn back now.\" \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman. \"The sun will catch us.\" \"Let it catch me then!\" \"You don't mean that.\" \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman. The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing wind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered battlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those avalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like mantles. \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the valley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of green fruits, she joined them. The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously with it, and whistled. The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children, bearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep hideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child someone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he was not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from the cliffs even as he was half across the valley. Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like singed snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace blast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at sunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again. Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of the valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of their tunnel. \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not a good thing to watch.\" They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of metal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred. Far away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space reflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his intra-embryo dreams fulfilled!

A metal space seed, intact, undamaged, lying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope for survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he was—strange thought—a grown man! The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava. The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming stopped. Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel, paused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during the night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will drink one last toast. To you, to the children.\" \"To you ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the icicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_CREATURES_THAT_TIME_FORGOT_4#0", "contents": "All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could not see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were sufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like mercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never penetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of the cliff comfortably warm. Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought with mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father seemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what will happen to me soon, though Sim in terror. Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements of his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing, feeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was love. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a smell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him, the look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes, then searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her brain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing him, rushing him along toward oblivion. He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his cells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and sinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at birth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant later, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned in a million crevices of thought and discovery. His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children, forever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no appetite, her eyes were webbed shut. \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last. The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded. His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just once more....\" She stared blindly, shivering. His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall. \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\" \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was handed to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She gave Sim one last fondling touch. Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly. \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy yourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\" Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp, looking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out and somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence. \"Why...?\" He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\" \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\" \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.

The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly, swayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent husband. That was the last time he ever saw them move. IV The night came and passed and then started the second day. The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a funeral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long, the bodies numerous. Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one hand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk. At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed. Nobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason? Was it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get to it and fly away into space? The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground where the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them. The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their few minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet air. Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged what they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third. They were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives. Another piece of his life opened wide. Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock daggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant black, low lines of small rock cliffs. \"War!\" The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men were running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs where other people lived. But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing? From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his stomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\" Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there was the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching Dark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue, forever hungry. Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up the rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious red berry he had found growing under an outcrop. The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then Sim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous jumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.

One beetle-like boy scuttled up the rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious red berry he had found growing under an outcrop. The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then Sim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous jumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart. Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should not be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\" Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried. \"What's your name, bad one?\" \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\" Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled features. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited for an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood the avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these were things of places, of scene—mute, extravagant manifestations of unthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here, now, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy! Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying: \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\" And he vanished around a rock. More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends, enemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible, quick life time? There was no time to make either, was there? Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for desired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made over things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends. Enemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've made an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\" And she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing older before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself. Others, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a ridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of the life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You see? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\" But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who tomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain breasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small girl whose hair was a violet blue flame. She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as silver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a love, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral pyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone. Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant. \"Your name?\" he shouted after her. \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back. \"I'm Sim,\" he"}

I'll remember Lyte, too!\" Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of hair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need weapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry—the sun's coming!\" They ran back to the caves."}

Surely this matter could have been dealt with in the usual way—assuming any action is necessary.\" \"I had a sharp attack of writer's cramp, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said. \"So I thought I'd better come along in person—just to be sure I was positive of making my point.\" \"Eh?\" \"Why, ah, there were a number of dispatches,\" Deputy Under-Secretary Magnan put in. \"Unfortunately, this being end-of-the-fiscal-year time, we found ourselves quite inundated with reports. Reports, reports, reports—\" \"Not criticizing the reporting system, are you, Mr. Magnan?\" the Under-Secretary barked. \"Gracious, no,\" Magnan said. \"I love reports.\" \"It seems nobody's told the Aga Kagans about fiscal years,\" Retief said. \"They're going right ahead with their program of land-grabbing on Flamme. So far, I've persuaded the Boyars that this is a matter for the Corps, and not to take matters into their own hands.\" The Under-Secretary nodded. \"Quite right. Carry on along the same lines. Now, if there's nothing further—\" \"Thank you, Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan said, rising. \"We certainly appreciate your guidance.\" \"There is a little something further,\" said Retief, sitting solidly in his chair. \"What's the Corps going to do about the Aga Kagans?\" The Under-Secretary turned a liverish eye on Retief. \"As Minister to Flamme, you should know that the function of a diplomatic representative is merely to ... what shall I say...?\" \"String them along?\" Magnan suggested. \"An unfortunate choice of phrase,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"However, it embodies certain realities of Galactic politics. The Corps must concern itself with matters of broad policy.\" \"Sixty years ago the Corps was encouraging the Boyars to settle Flamme,\" Retief said. \"They were assured of Corps support.\" \"I don't believe you'll find that in writing,\" said the Under-Secretary blandly. \"In any event, that was sixty years ago. At that time a foothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements was deemed desirable. Now the situation has changed.\" \"The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme,\" Retief said. \"They've cleared jungle, descummed the seas, irrigated deserts, set out forests. They've just about reached the point where they can begin to enjoy it. The Aga Kagans have picked this as a good time to move in. They've landed thirty detachments of 'fishermen'—complete with armored trawlers mounting 40 mm infinite repeaters—and another two dozen parties of 'homesteaders'—all male and toting rocket launchers.\" \"Surely there's land enough on the world to afford space to both groups,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"A spirit of co-operation—\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_DESERT_AND_THE_STARS_2#0", "contents": "\"The Boyars needed some co-operation sixty years ago,\" Retief said. \"They tried to get the Aga Kagans to join in and help them beat back some of the saurian wild life that liked to graze on people. The Corps didn't like the idea. They wanted to see an undisputed anti-Concordiatist enclave. The Aga Kagans didn't want to play, either. But now that the world is tamed, they're moving in.\" \"The exigencies of diplomacy require a flexible policy—\" \"I want a firm assurance of Corps support to take back to Flamme,\" Retief said. \"The Boyars are a little naive. They don't understand diplomatic triple-speak. They just want to hold onto the homes they've made out of a wasteland.\" \"I'm warning you, Retief!\" the Under-Secretary snapped, leaning forward, wattles quivering. \"Corps policy with regard to Flamme includes no inflammatory actions based on outmoded concepts. The Boyars will have to accommodate themselves to the situation!\" \"That's what I'm afraid of,\" Retief said. \"They're not going to sit still and watch it happen. If I don't take back concrete evidence of Corps backing, we're going to have a nice hot little shooting war on our hands.\" The Under-Secretary pushed out his lips and drummed his fingers on the desk. \"Confounded hot-heads,\" he muttered. \"Very well, Retief. I'll go along to the extent of a Note; but positively no further.\" \"A Note? I was thinking of something more like a squadron of Corps Peace Enforcers running through a few routine maneuvers off Flamme.\" \"Out of the question. A stiffly worded Protest Note is the best I can do. That's final.\" Back in the corridor, Magnan turned to Retief. \"When will you learn not to argue with Under-Secretaries? One would think you actively disliked the idea of ever receiving a promotion. I was astonished at the Under-Secretary's restraint. Frankly, I was stunned when he actually agreed to a Note. I, of course, will have to draft it.\" Magnan pulled at his lower lip thoughtfully. \"Now, I wonder, should I view with deep concern an act of open aggression, or merely point out an apparent violation of technicalities....\" \"Don't bother,\" Retief said. \"I have a draft all ready to go.\" \"But how—?\" \"I had a feeling I'd get paper instead of action,\" Retief said. \"I thought I'd save a little time all around.\" \"At times, your cynicism borders on impudence.\" \"At other times, it borders on disgust. Now, if you'll run the Note through for signature, I'll try to catch the six o'clock shuttle.\" \"Leaving so soon? There's an important reception tonight. Some of our biggest names will be there. An excellent opportunity for you to join in the diplomatic give-and-take.\" \"No, thanks. I want to get back to Flamme and join in something mild, like a dinosaur hunt.\" \"When you get there,\" said Magnan, \"I hope you'll make it quite clear that this matter is to be settled without violence.\" \"Don't worry.

He accepted a tall glass from a white-jacketed waiter and regarded the flamboyant Flamme sunset, a gorgeous blaze of vermillion and purple that reflected from a still lake, tinged the broad lawn with color, silhouetted tall poplars among flower beds. \"You've done great things here in sixty years, Georges,\" said Retief. \"Not that natural geological processes wouldn't have produced the same results, given a couple of hundred million years.\" \"Don't belabor the point,\" the Boyar Chef d'Regime said. \"Since we seem to be on the verge of losing it.\" \"You're forgetting the Note.\" \"A Note,\" Georges said, waving his cigar. \"What the purple polluted hell is a Note supposed to do? I've got Aga Kagan claim-jumpers camped in the middle of what used to be a fine stand of barley, cooking sheep's brains over dung fires not ten miles from Government House—and upwind at that.\" \"Say, if that's the same barley you distill your whiskey from, I'd call that a first-class atrocity.\" \"Retief, on your say-so, I've kept my boys on a short leash. They've put up with plenty. Last week, while you were away, these barbarians sailed that flotilla of armor-plated junks right through the middle of one of our best oyster breeding beds. It was all I could do to keep a bunch of our men from going out in private helis and blasting 'em out of the water.\" \"That wouldn't have been good for the oysters, either.\" \"That's what I told 'em. I also said you'd be back here in a few days with something from Corps HQ. When I tell 'em all we've got is a piece of paper, that'll be the end. There's a strong vigilante organization here that's been outfitting for the last four weeks. If I hadn't held them back with assurances that the CDT would step in and take care of this invasion, they would have hit them before now.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_DESERT_AND_THE_STARS_4#0", "contents": "\"That would have been a mistake,\" said Retief. \"The Aga Kagans are tough customers. They're active on half a dozen worlds at the moment. They've been building up for this push for the last five years. A show of resistance by you Boyars without Corps backing would be an invitation to slaughter—with the excuse that you started it.\" \"So what are we going to do? Sit here and watch these goat-herders take over our farms and fisheries?\" \"Those goat-herders aren't all they seem. They've got a first-class modern navy.\" \"I've seen 'em. They camp in goat-skin tents, gallop around on animal-back, wear dresses down to their ankles—\" \"The 'goat-skin' tents are a high-polymer plastic, made in the same factory that turns out those long flowing bullet-proof robes you mention. The animals are just for show. Back home they use helis and ground cars of the most modern design.\" The Chef d'Regime chewed his cigar. \"Why the masquerade?\" \"Something to do with internal policies, I suppose.\" \"So we sit tight and watch 'em take our world away from us. That's what I get for playing along with you, Retief. We should have clobbered these monkeys as soon as they set foot on our world.\" \"Slow down, I haven't finished yet. There's still the Note.\" \"I've got plenty of paper already. Rolls and rolls of it.\" \"Give diplomatic processes a chance,\" said Retief. \"The Note hasn't even been delivered yet. Who knows? We may get surprising results.\" \"If you expect me to supply a runner for the purpose, you're out of luck. From what I hear, he's likely to come back with his ears stuffed in his hip pocket.\" \"I'll deliver the Note personally,\" Retief said. \"I could use a couple of escorts—preferably strong-arm lads.\" The Chef d'Regime frowned, blew out a cloud of smoke. \"I wasn't kidding about these Aga Kagans,\" he said. \"I hear they have some nasty habits. I don't want to see you operated on with the same knives they use to skin out the goats.\" \"I'd be against that myself. Still, the mail must go through.\" \"Strong-arm lads, eh? What have you got in mind, Retief?\" \"A little muscle in the background is an old diplomatic custom,\" Retief said. The Chef d'Regime stubbed out his cigar thoughtfully. \"I used to be a pretty fair elbow-wrestler myself,\" he said. \"Suppose I go along...?\" \"That,\" said Retief, \"should lend just the right note of solidarity to our little delegation.\" He hitched his chair closer. \"Now, depending on what we run into, here's how we'll play it....\" II Eight miles into the rolling granite hills west of the capital, a black-painted official air-car flying the twin flags of Chief of State and Terrestrial Minister skimmed along a foot above a pot-holed road. Slumped in the padded seat, the Boyar Chef d'Regime waved his cigar glumly at the surrounding hills. \"Fifty years ago this was bare rock,\" he said. \"We've bred special strains of bacteria here to break down the formations into soil, and we followed up with a program of broad-spectrum fertilization."}

We start with legumes and follow up with cereals. Wait until you see this next section. It's an old flood plain, came into production thirty years ago. One of our finest—\" The air-car topped a rise. The Chef dropped his cigar and half rose, with a hoarse yell. A herd of scraggly goats tossed their heads among a stand of ripe grain. The car pulled to a stop. Retief held the Boyar's arm. \"Keep calm, Georges,\" he said. \"Remember, we're on a diplomatic mission. It wouldn't do to come to the conference table smelling of goats.\" \"Let me at 'em!\" Georges roared. \"I'll throttle 'em with my bare hands!\" A bearded goat eyed the Boyar Chef sardonically, jaw working. \"Look at that long-nosed son!\" The goat gave a derisive bleat and took another mouthful of ripe grain. \"Did you see that?\" Georges yelled. \"They've trained the son of a—\" \"Chin up, Georges,\" Retief said. \"We'll take up the goat problem along with the rest.\" \"I'll murder 'em!\" \"Hold it, Georges. Look over there.\" A hundred yards away, a trio of brown-cloaked horsemen topped a rise, paused dramatically against the cloudless pale sky, then galloped down the slope toward the car, rifles bobbing at their backs, cloaks billowing out behind. Side by side they rode, through the brown-golden grain, cutting three narrow swaths that ran in a straight sweep from the ridge to the air-car where Retief and the Chef d'Regime hovered, waiting. Georges scrambled for the side of the car. \"Just wait 'til I get my hands on him!\" Retief pulled him back. \"Sit tight and look pleased, Georges. Never give the opposition a hint of your true feelings. Pretend you're a goat lover—and hand me one of your cigars.\" The three horsemen pulled up in a churn of chaff and a clatter of pebbles. Georges coughed, batting a hand at the settling dust. Retief peeled the cigar unhurriedly, sniffed, at it and thumbed it alight. He drew at it, puffed out a cloud of smoke and glanced casually at the trio of Aga Kagan cavaliers. \"Peace be with you,\" he intoned in accent-free Kagan. \"May your shadows never grow less.\""}

He lowered the rifle, muttering. Blackbeard turned back to Retief. \"Begone, interlopers,\" he said. \"You disturb the goats.\" \"Provision is not taken to the houses of the generous,\" Retief said. \"May the creatures dine well ere they move on.\" \"Hah! The goats of the Aga Kaga graze on the lands of the Aga Kaga.\" The leader edged his horse close, eyed Retief fiercely. \"We welcome no intruders on our lands.\" \"To praise a man for what he does not possess is to make him appear foolish,\" Retief said. \"These are the lands of the Boyars. But enough of these pleasantries. We seek audience with your ruler.\" \"You may address me as 'Exalted One',\" the leader said. \"Now dismount from that steed of Shaitan.\" \"It is written, if you need anything from a dog, call him 'sir',\" Retief said. \"I must decline to impute canine ancestry to a guest. Now you may conduct us to your headquarters.\" \"Enough of your insolence!\" The bearded man cocked his rifle. \"I could blow your heads off!\" \"The hen has feathers, but it does not fly,\" Retief said. \"We have asked for escort. A slave must be beaten with a stick; for a free man, a hint is enough.\" \"You mock me, pale one. I warn you—\" \"Only love makes me weep,\" Retief said. \"I laugh at hatred.\" \"Get out of the car!\" Retief puffed at his cigar, eyeing the Aga Kagan cheerfully. The youth in the rear moved forward, teeth bared. \"Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,'\" Retief said. \"I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults,\" the bearded Aga Kagan roared. \"These hens of mine have feathers—and talons as well!\" \"When God would destroy an ant, he gives him wings,\" Retief said. \"Distress in misfortune is another misfortune.\" The bearded man's face grew purple. Retief dribbled the ash from his cigar over the side of the car. \"Now I think we'd better be getting on,\" he said briskly. \"I've enjoyed our chat, but we do have business to attend to.\" The bearded leader laughed shortly. \"Does the condemned man beg for the axe?\" he enquired rhetorically. \"You shall visit the Aga Kaga, then. Move on! And make no attempt to escape, else my gun will speak you a brief farewell.\" The horsemen glowered, then, at a word from the leader, took positions around the car.

The armed escort motioned the car to a halt before an immense tent of glistening black. Before the tent armed men lounged under a pennant bearing a lion couchant in crimson on a field verte. \"Get out,\" Blackbeard ordered. The guards eyed the visitors, their drawn sabers catching sunlight. Retief and Georges stepped from the car onto rich rugs spread on the grass. They followed the ferocious gesture of the bearded man through the opening into a perfumed interior of luminous shadows. A heavy odor of incense hung in the air, and the strumming of stringed instruments laid a muted pattern of sound behind the decorations of gold and blue, silver and green. At the far end of the room, among a bevy of female slaves, a large and resplendently clad man with blue-black hair and a clean-shaven chin popped a grape into his mouth. He wiped his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offered by a handmaiden, belched loudly and looked the callers over. Blackbeard cleared his throat. \"Down on your faces in the presence of the Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of East and West.\" \"Sorry,\" Retief said firmly. \"My hay-fever, you know.\" The reclining giant waved a hand languidly. \"Never mind the formalities,\" he said. \"Approach.\" Retief and Georges crossed the thick rugs. A cold draft blew toward them. The reclining man sneezed violently, wiped his nose on another silken scarf and held up a hand. \"Night and the horses and the desert know me,\" he said in resonant tones. \"Also the sword and the guest and paper and pen—\" He paused, wrinkled his nose and sneezed again. \"Turn off that damned air-conditioner,\" he snapped. He settled himself and motioned the bearded man to him. The two exchanged muted remarks. Then the bearded man stepped back, ducked his head and withdrew to the rear. \"Excellency,\" Retief said, \"I have the honor to present M. Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.\" \"Planetary government?\" The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. \"My men have observed a few squatters along the shore. If they're in distress, I'll see about a distribution of goat-meat.\" \"It is the punishment of the envious to grieve at anothers' plenty,\" Retief said. \"No goat-meat will be required.\" \"Ralph told me you talk like a page out of Mustapha ben Abdallah Katib Jelebi,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"I know a few old sayings myself.

As for myself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the end one will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my years are numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well, hunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to others the arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.\" \"You admit you're here to grab our land, then,\" Georges said. \"That's the damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression—\" \"Ah, ah!\" The Aga Kaga held up a hand. \"Watch your vocabulary, my dear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial self-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Or possibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly exploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition, an activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle of Colonial Imperialism.\" \"Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notorious planet-grabbers in Sector history, you—you—\" \"Call me Stanley.\" The Aga Kaga munched a grape. \"I merely face the realities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of historical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off lightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for holding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends. And I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\" \"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey and slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a struggle!\" \"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as his glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light. \"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges. \"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and outmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we're prepared to be generous. You may continue to occupy such areas as we do not immediately require until such time as you're able to make other arrangements.\" \"And by the time we've got a crop growing out of what was bare rock, you'll be"}

{"chunk_id": "THE_DESERT_AND_THE_STARS_8#0", "contents": "\"Quite alone,\" the Aga said. He nodded sagely. \"Yes, one need but read the lesson of history. The Corps Diplomatique will make expostulatory noises, but it will accept the fait accompli . You, my dear sir, are but a very small nibble. We won't make the mistake of excessive greed. We shall inch our way to empire—and those who stand in our way shall be dubbed warmongers.\" \"I see you're quite a student of history, Stanley,\" Retief said. \"I wonder if you recall the eventual fate of most of the would-be empire nibblers of the past?\" \"Ah, but they grew incautious. They went too far, too fast.\" \"The confounded impudence,\" Georges rasped. \"Tells us to our face what he has in mind!\" \"An ancient and honorable custom, from the time of Mein Kampf and the Communist Manifesto through the Porcelain Wall of Leung. Such declarations have a legendary quality. It's traditional that they're never taken at face value.\" \"But always,\" Retief said, \"there was a critical point at which the man on horseback could have been pulled from the saddle.\" \" Could have been,\" the Aga Kaga chuckled. He finished the grapes and began peeling an orange. \"But they never were. Hitler could have been stopped by the Czech Air Force in 1938; Stalin was at the mercy of the primitive atomics of the west in 1946; Leung was grossly over-extended at Rangoon. But the onus of that historic role could not be overcome. It has been the fate of your spiritual forebears to carve civilization from the wilderness and then, amid tearing of garments and the heaping of ashes of self-accusation on your own confused heads, to withdraw, leaving the spoils for local political opportunists and mob leaders, clothed in the mystical virtue of native birth. Have a banana.\" \"You're stretching your analogy a little too far,\" Retief said. \"You're banking on the inaction of the Corps. You could be wrong.\" \"I shall know when to stop,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"Tell me, Stanley,\" Retief said, rising. \"Are we quite private here?\" \"Yes, perfectly so,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"None would dare to intrude in my council.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Retief. \"You have a proposal to make in confidence? But what of our dear friend Georges? One would not like to see him disillusioned.\" \"Don't worry about Georges. He's a realist, like you. He's prepared to deal in facts. Hard facts, in this case.\" The Aga Kaga nodded thoughtfully. \"What are you getting at?\" \"You're basing your plan of action on the certainty that the Corps will sit by, wringing its hands, while you embark on a career of planetary piracy.\" \"Isn't it the custom?\" the Aga Kaga smiled complacently. \"I have news for you, Stanley. In this instance, neck-wringing seems more in order than hand-wringing.\" The Aga Kaga frowned. \"Your manner—\" \"Never mind our manners!\" Georges blurted, standing. \"We don't need any lessons from goat-herding land-thieves!\" The Aga Kaga's face darkened. \"You dare to speak thus to me, pig of a muck-grubber!\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"You see my problem, Professor?\" Tony Carmen held his pinkly manicured, flashily ringed hands wide. I saw his problem and it was warmly embarrassing. \"Really, Mr. Carmen,\" I said, \"this isn't the sort of thing you discuss with a total stranger. I'm not a doctor—not of medicine, anyway—or a lawyer.\" \"They can't help me. I need an operator in your line.\" \"I work for the United States government. I can't become involved in anything illegal.\" Carmen smoothed down the front of his too-tight midnight blue suit and touched the diamond sticking in his silver tie. \"You can't, Professor Venetti? Ever hear of the Mafia?\" \"I've heard of it,\" I said uneasily. \"An old fraternal organization something like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. It allegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is a responsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stamping out. We don't even like to see the word in print.\" \"I can understand honest Italian-Americans feeling that way. But guys like me know the Mafia is still with it. We can put the squeeze on marks like you pretty easy.\" You don't have to tell even a third generation American about the Mafia. Maybe that was the trouble. I had heard too much and for too long. All the stories I had ever heard about the Mafia, true or false, built up an unendurable threat. \"All right, I'll try to help you, Carmen. But ... that is, you didn't kill any of these people?\" He snorted. \"I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.\" \"Please,\" I said weakly. \"You needn't incriminate yourself with me.\" \"I was in the Marines,\" Carmen said hotly. \"Listen, Professor, these aren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these days. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club haven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims. Rumbums with too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets going to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just stows them at my place to embarrass me. Figures to make me lose my liquor license or take a contempt before the Grand Jury.\" \"I don't suppose you could just go to the police—\" I saw the answer in his eyes. \"No. I don't suppose you could.\" \"I told you once, Professor, but I'll tell you again. I have to get rid of these bodies they keep leaving in my kitchen. I can take 'em and throw them in the river, sure.

And I suppose the furnace leaves ashes and there's always traces of hair and teeth in the garbage disposal... An interesting problem, at that.\" \"I figured you could handle it,\" Carmen said, leaning back comfortably in the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. \"I heard you were working on something to get rid of trash for the government.\" \"That,\" I told him, \"is restricted information. I subcontracted that work from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?\" \"Ways, Professor, ways.\" The government did want me to find a way to dispose of wastes—radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any country could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a small-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him dispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the shadow of the Black Hand cooled it off. \"Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,\" I said. \"I'll call you.\" \"Don't take too long, Professor,\" Carmen said cordially."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_EXPENDABLES_2#0", "contents": "The big drum topped with a metallic coolie's hat had started out as a neutralizer for radioactivity. Now I didn't know what to call it. The AEC had found burying canisters of hot rubbish in the desert or in the Gulf had eventually proved unsatisfactory. Earth tremors or changes of temperature split the tanks in the ground, causing leaks. The undersea containers rusted and corroded through the time, poisoning fish and fishermen. Through the SBA I had been awarded a subcontract to work on the problem. The ideal solution would be to find a way to neutralize radioactive emanations, alpha, beta, X et cetera. (No, my dear, et cetera rays aren't any more dangerous than the rest.) But this is easier written than done. Of course, getting energy to destroy energy without producing energy or matter is a violation of the maxim of the conservation of energy. But I didn't let that stop me—any more than I would have let the velocity of light put any limitations on a spacecraft engine had I been engaged to work on one. You can't allow other people's ideas to tie you hand and foot. There are some who tell me, however, that my refusal to honor such time-tested cliches is why I only have a small private laboratory owned by myself, my late wife's father and the bank, instead of working in the vast facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or General Motors. To this, I can only smile and nod. But even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, I failed. I could not neutralize radioactivity. All I had been able to do (by a basic disturbance in the electromagnetogravitational co-ordinant system for Earth-Sun) was to reduce the mass of the radioactive matter. This only concentrated the radiations, as in boiling contaminated water. It did make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle, but it was no breakthrough on the central problem. Now, in the middle of this, I was supposed to find a way to get rid of some damned bodies for Carmen. Pressed for time and knowing the results wouldn't have to be so precise or carefully defined for a racketeer as for the United States government, I began experimenting. I cut corners. I bypassed complete safety circuits. I put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the wiring diagrams. If I got some kind of passable incinerator I would be happy. I turned the machine on. The lights popped out. There were changes that should be made before I tried that again, but instead I only found a larger fuse for a heavier load and jammed that in the switchbox. I flipped my machine into service once again. The lights flickered and held. The dials on my control board told me the story. It was hard to take. But there it was. The internal Scale showed zero. I had had a slightly hot bar of silver alloy inside. It was completely gone. Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been no change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained"}

Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been no change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained by the mechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no sudden discharge of electricity or radioactivity. I checked for a standard anti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had gone to zero but never to minus. I was at last violating conservation of energy—not by successfully inverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass ... by simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side effects. I knew the government wouldn't be interested, since I couldn't explain how my device worked. No amount of successful demonstration could ever convince anybody with any scientific training that it actually did work. But I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassing \"how\" when he was incapable of understanding the explanation."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_EXPENDABLES_3#0", "contents": "\"Yeah, but how does it work?\" Tony Carmen demanded of me, sleeking his mirror-black hair and staring up at the disk-topped drum. \"Why do you care?\" I asked irritably. \"It will dispose of your bodies for you.\" \"I got a reason that goes beyond the stiff, but let's stick to that just for now. Where are these bodies going? I don't want them winding up in the D.A.'s bathtub.\" \"Why not? How could they trace them back to you?\" \"You're the scientist,\" Tony said hotly. \"I got great respect for those crime lab boys. Maybe the stiff got some of my exclusive brand of talc on it, I don't know.\" \"Listen here, Carmen,\" I said, \"what makes you think these bodies are going somewhere? Think of it only as a kind of—incinerator.\" \"Not on your life, Professor. The gadget don't get hot so how can it burn? It don't use enough electricity to fry. It don't cut 'em up or crush 'em down, or dissolve them in acid. I've seen disappearing cabinets before.\" Mafia or not, I saw red. \"Are you daring to suggest that I am working some trick with trap doors or sliding panels?\" \"Easy, Professor,\" Carmen said, effortlessly shoving me back with one palm. \"I'm not saying you have the machine rigged. It's just that you have to be dropping the stuff through a sliding panel in—well, everything around us. You're sliding all that aside and dropping things through. But I want to know where they wind up. Reasonable?\" Carmen was an uneducated lout and a criminal but he had an instinctive feel for the mechanics of physics. \"I don't know where the stuff goes, Carmen,\" I finally admitted. \"It might go into another plane of existence. 'Another dimension' the writers for the American Weekly would describe it. Or into our past, or our future.\" The swarthy racketeer pursed his lips and apparently did some rapid calculation. \"I don't mind the first two, but I don't like them going into the future. If they do that, they may show up again in six months.\" \"Or six million years.\" \"You'll have to cut that future part out, Professor.\" I was beginning to get a trifle impatient. All those folk tales I had heard about the Mafia were getting more distant. \"See here, Carmen, I could lie to you and say they went into the prehistoric past and you would never know the difference. But the truth is, I just don't know where the processed material goes. There's a chance it may go into the future, yes. But unless it goes exactly one year or exactly so many years it would appear in empty space ... because the earth will have moved from the spot it was transmitted. I don't know for sure. Perhaps the slight Deneb-ward movement of the Solar System would wreck a perfect three-point landing even then and cause the dispatched materials to burn up from atmospheric friction, like meteors. You will just have to take a chance on the future. That's the best I can do.\" Carmen"}

How many of these things can you turn out, Professor?\" \"I can construct a duplicate of this device so that you may destroy the unwanted corpses that you would have me believe are delivered to you with the regularity of the morning milk run.\" The racketeer waved that suggestion aside. \"I'm talking about a big operation, Venetti. These things can take the place of incinerators, garbage disposals, waste baskets....\" \"Impractical,\" I snorted. \"You don't realize the tremendous amount of electrical power these devices require....\" \"Nuts! From what you said, the machine is like a TV set; it takes a lot of power to get it started, but then on it coasts on its own generators.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_EXPENDABLES_4#0", "contents": "\"There's something to what you say,\" I admitted in the face of his unexpected information. \"But I can hardly turn my invention over to your entirely persuasive salesmen, I'm sure. This is part of the results of an investigation for the government. Washington will have to decide what to do with the machine.\" \"Listen, Professor,\" Carmen began, \"the Mafia—\" \"What makes you think I'm any more afraid of the Mafia than I am of the F.B.I.? I may have already sealed my fate by letting you in on this much. Machinegunning is hardly a less attractive fate to me than a poor security rating. To me, being dead professionally would be as bad as being dead biologically.\" Tony Carmen laid a heavy hand on my shoulder. I finally deduced he intended to be cordial. \"Of course,\" he said smoothly \"you have to give this to Washington but there are ways , Professor. I know. I'm a business man—\" \"You are ?\" I said. He named some of the businesses in which he held large shares of stock. \"You are .\" \"I've had experience in this sort of thing. We simply leak the information to a few hundred well selected persons about all that your machine can do. We'll call 'em Expendables, because they can expend anything.\" \"I,\" I interjected, \"planned to call it the Venetti Machine.\" \"Professor, who calls the radio the Marconi these days?\" \"There are Geiger-Muller Counters, though,\" I said. \"You don't have to give a Geiger counter the sex appeal of a TV set or a hardtop convertible. We'll call them Expendables. No home will be complete without one.\" \"Perfect for disposing of unwanted bodies,\" I mused. \"The murder rate will go alarmingly with those devices within easy reach.\" \"Did that stop Sam Colt or Henry Ford?\" Tony Carmen asked reasonably.... Naturally, I was aware that the government would not be interested in my machine. I am not a Fortean, a psychic, a psionicist or a screwball. But the government frequently gets things it doesn't know what to do with—like airplanes in the 'twenties. When it doesn't know what to do, it doesn't do it. There have been hundreds of workable perpetual motion machines patented, for example. Of course, they weren't vices in the strictest sense of the word. Many of them used the external power of gravity, they would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for the meanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there, moving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them. I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (with some possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which they didn't believe actually could work. Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got his hands on it. Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of."}

I was shivering slightly, my teeth rattling like the porcelain they were. Was this the storied \"ride,\" I wondered? Carmen finally returned to the car, unlatched the door and slid in. He did not reinsert the ignition key. I did not feel like sprinting down the deserted street. \"The boys will have it set up in a minute,\" Tony the racketeer informed me. \"What?\" The firing squad? \"The Expendable, of course.\" \"Here? You dragged me out here to see how you have prostituted my invention? I presume you've set it up with a 'Keep Our City Clean' sign pasted on it.\" He chuckled. It was a somewhat nasty sound, or so I imagined. A flashlight winked in the sooty twilight. \"Okay. Let's go,\" Tony said, slapping my shoulder. I got out of the car, rubbing my flabby bicep. Whenever I took my teen-age daughter to the beach from my late wife's parents' home, I frequently found 230 pound bullies did kick sand in my ears. The machine was installed on the corner, half covered with a gloomy white shroud, and fearlessly plugged into the city lighting system via a blanketed streetlamp. Two hoods hovered in a doorway ready to take care of the first cop with a couple of fifties or a single .38, as necessity dictated. Tony guided my elbow. \"Okay, Professor, I think I understand the bit now, but I'll let you run it up with the flagpole for me, to see how it waves to the national anthem.\" \"Here?\" I spluttered once more. \"I told you, Carmen, I wanted nothing more to do with you. Your check is still on deposit....\" \"You didn't want anything to do with me in the first place.\" The thug's teeth flashed in the night. \"Throw your contraption into gear, buddy.\" That was the first time the tone of respect, even if faked, had gone out of his voice. I moved to the switchboard of my invention. What remained was as simple as adjusting a modern floor lamp to a medium light position. I flipped. Restraining any impulse toward colloqualism, I was also deeply disturbed by what next occurred. One of the massive square shapes on the horizon vanished. \"What have you done?\" I yelped, ripping the cover off the machine. Even under the uncertain illumination of the smogged stars I could see that the unit was half gone—in fact, exactly halved. \"Squint the Seal is one of my boys. He used to be a mechanic in the old days for Burger, Madle, the guys who used to rob banks and stuff.\" There was an unmistakable note of boyish admiration in Carmen's voice. \"He figured the thing would work like that. Separate the poles and you increase the size of the working area.\" \"You mean square the operational field. Your idiot doesn't even know mechanics.\" \"No, but he knows all about how any kind of machine works.\" \"You call that working?\" I demanded. \"Do you"}

I looked at the old warehouse and of course didn't see it. \"What was this a test for?\" I asked, fearful of the Frankenstein I had made. \"What are you planning to do now?\" \"This was no test, Venetti.

Why, that's murder .\" \"Not,\" Carmen said, \"without no corpus delecti .\" \"The body of the crime remains without the body of the victim,\" I remembered from my early Ellery Queen training. \"You're talking too much, Professor,\" Tony suggested. \"Remember, you did it with your machine.\" \"Yes,\" I said at length. \"And why are we standing here letting those machines sit there?\""}

One two-inch story—barely making page one because of a hole to fill at the bottom of an account of the number of victims of Indian summer heat prostration—told of the incineration of a warehouse on Fleet Street by an ingenious new arson bomb that left \"virtually\" no trace. (Maybe the fire inspector had planted a few traces to make his explanation more creditable.) The second item was further over in a science column just off the editorial page. It told of the government—!—developing a new process of waste disposal rivaling the old Buck Rogers disintegrator ray. This, I presumed, was one of Tony Carmen's information leaks. If he hoped to arouse the public into demanding my invention I doubted he would succeed. The public had been told repeatedly of a new radioactive process for preserving food and a painless way of spraying injections through the skin. But they were still stuck with refrigerators and hypodermic needles. I had forced my way half-way through the paper and the terrible coffee I made when the doorbell rang. I was hardly surprised when it turned out to be Tony Carmen behind the front door. He pushed in, slapping a rolled newspaper in his palm. \"Action, Professor.\" \"The district attorney has indicted you?\" I asked hopefully. \"He's not even indicted you , Venetti. No, I got a feeler on this plant in the Times .\" I shook my head. \"The government will take over the invention, no matter what the public wants.\" \"The public? Who cares about the public? The Arcivox corporation wants this machine of yours. They have their agents tracing the plant now. They will go from the columnist to his legman to my man and finally to you. Won't be long before they get here. An hour maybe.\" \"Arcivox makes radios and TV sets. What do they want with the Expendables?\" \"Opening up a new appliance line with real innovations. I hear they got a new refrigerator. All open. Just shelves—no doors or sides. They want a revolutionary garbage disposal too.\" \"Do you own stock in the company? Is that how you know?\" \"I own stock in a competitor. That's how I know,\" Carmen informed me. \"Listen, Professor, you can sell to Arcivox and still keep control of the patents through a separate corporation. And I'll give you 49% of its stock.\" This was Carmen's idea of a magnanimous offer for my invention. It was a pretty good offer—49% and my good health. \"But will the government let Arcivox have the machine for commercial use?\" \"The government would let Arcivox have the hydrogen bomb if they found a commercial use for it.\" There was a sturdy knock on the door, not a shrill ring of the bell. \"That must be Arcivox now,\" Carmen growled. \"They have the best detectives in the business. You know what to tell them?\" I knew what to tell them."}

Miss Brown, my secretary, was getting a good look at my pale, bony chest. Well, for the salary she got, she could stand to look. Of course, she herself was wearing a modest one-strap sun dress, not shorts and halters like some of the girls. \"My,\" she observed \"it certainly is humid for March, isn't it, Professor Venetti?\" I agreed that it was.

There was no getting around it—I just wasn't happy as a business man. I had been counting on being only a figurehead in the Expendable Patent Holding Corporation, but Tony Carmen didn't like office work. And he hadn't anyone he trusted any more than me. Even. I jerked open a drawer and pulled off a paper towel from the roll I had stolen in the men's room. Scrubbing my chest and neck with it, I smoothed it out and dropped it into the wastebasket. It slid down the tapering sides and through the narrow slot above the Expendable Field. I had redesigned the wastebaskets after a janitor had stepped in one. But Gimpy was happy now, with the $50,000 we paid him. I opened my mouth and Miss Brown's pencil perked up its eraser, reflecting her fierce alertness. Tony Carmen banged open the door, and I closed my mouth. \"G-men on the way here,\" he blurted and collapsed into a chair opposite Miss Brown. \"Don't revert to type,\" I warned him. \"What kind of G-Men? FBI? FCC? CIA? FDA? USTD?\" \"Investigators for the Atomic Energy Commission.\" The solemn, conservatively dressed young man in the door touched the edge of his snap-brim hat as he"}

You may find this troublesome, gentlemen, but your government intends to confiscate all of the devices using your so-called Expendable field, and forever bar their manufacture in this country or their importation.\" \"You stinking G-men aren't getting away with this,\" Carmen said ingratiatingly. \"Ever hear of the Mafia?\" \"Not much,\" the young man admitted earnestly, \"since the FBI finished with its deportations a few years back.\" I cleared my throat. \"I must admit that the destruction of a multi-billion business is disconcerting before lunch. May we ask why you took this step?\" The agent inserted a finger between his collar and tie. \"Have you noticed how unseasonably warm it is?\" \"I wondered if you had. You're going to have heat prostration if you keep that suit coat on five minutes more.\" The young man collapsed back in his chair, loosening the top button of his ivy league jacket, looking from my naked hide to the gossomer scrap of sport shirt Carmen wore. \"We have to dress inconspicuously in the service,\" he panted weakly. I nodded understandingly. \"What does the heat have to do with the outlawing of the Expendables?\" \"At first we thought there might be some truth in the folk nonsense that nuclear tests had something to do with raising the mean temperature of the world,\" the AEC man said. \"But our scientists quickly found they weren't to blame.\" \"Clever of them.\" \"Yes, they saw that the widespread use of your machines was responsible for the higher temperature. Your device violates the law of conservation of energy, seemingly . It seemingly destroys matter without creating energy. Actually—\" He paused dramatically. \"Actually, your device added the energy it created in destroying matter to the energy potential of the planet in the form of heat . You see what that means? If your devices continue in operation, the mean temperature of Earth will rise to the point where we burst into flame. They must be outlawed!\" \"I agree,\" I said reluctantly. Tony Carmen spoke up. \"No, you don't, Professor. We don't agree to that.\" I waved his protests aside. \"I would agree,\" I said, \"except that it wouldn't work. Explain the danger to the public, let them feel the heat rise themselves, and they will hoard Expendables against seizure and continue to use them, until we do burst into flame, as you put it so religiously.\" \"Why?\" the young man demanded. \"Because Expendables are convenient. There is a ban on frivolous use of water due to the dire need. But the police still have to go stop people from watering lawns, and I suspect not a few swimming pools are being filled on the sly.

While it was midnight outside, the fluorescents made the scene more visible than sunlight. My Disexpendable was a medium-sized drum in a tripod frame with an unturned coolie's hat at the bottom. Breathlessly, I closed the switch and the scooped disc began slowly to revolve. \"Is it my imagination,\" the agent asked, \"or is it getting cooler in here?\" \"Professor.\" Carmen gave me a warning nudge. There was now something on the revolving disc. It was a bar of some shiny gray metal. \"Kill the power, Professor,\" Carmen said. \"Can it be,\" I wondered, \"that the machine is somehow recreating or drawing back the processed material from some other time or dimension?\" \"Shut the thing off, Venetti!\" the racketeer demanded. But too late. There was now a somewhat dead man sitting in the saddle of the turning circle of metal. If Harry Keno had only been sane when he turned up on that merry-go-round in Boston I feel we would have learned much of immense value on the nature of time and space. As it is, I feel that it is a miscarriage of justice to hold me in connection with the murders I am sure Tony Carmen did commit. I hope this personal account when published will end the vicious story supported by the district attorney that it was I who sought Tony Carmen out and offered to dispose of his enemies and that I sought his financial backing for the exploitation of my invention. This is the true, and only true, account of the development of the machine known as the Expendable. I am only sorry, now that the temperature has been standardized once more, that the Expendable's antithesis, the Disexpendable, is of too low an order of efficiency to be of much value as a power source in these days of nuclear and solar energy. So the world is again stuck with the problem of waste disposal ... including all that I dumped before. But as a great American once said, you can't win 'em all.

{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_MAN_INTO_SPACE_1#0", "contents": "THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a nightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets. After recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously at himself. “Here I was picked as the most stable of a group of two hundred cadets,” he thought, “and chosen to make man’s first trip into space, yet I’m shaking like a leaf.” He got out of bed and went over to the window. From his father’s temporary apartment, he could see distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into space tomorrow night. He had been awarded the frightening honor of making that trip. 10 As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix, Arizona’s, double-decked streets, elevated over one another to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying stop lights, he thought back over the years; to the 1950’s, when mice and monkeys were sent up in Vikings to launch mankind’s first probing of the mysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites were launched; to the 1960’s, when huger, multiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem of escape velocity; to 1975—today—when man was finally ready to send one of his own kind into the uninhabited deeps. Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would not come. In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps of mother and father. By their sound he knew they were the footsteps of worried people. This hurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness. The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when he had first signed up for space-cadet training. They had known there was an extremely high percentage of washouts, and after each test he passed, they had pretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly they had hoped he would fail, for they were aware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists were working for—the goal that had just now been reached. Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted until morning. He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got up, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform, and tugged on the polished gray boots. He took one final look around his room as though in farewell, then went out to the kitchen. 11 His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to act as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending to enjoy his morning paper, nodding only casually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring scrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn’t a very good actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped her eyes with her free hand. The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had to be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three of them sat down at the table, still speaking in monosyllables and of unimportant things. They made a pretense of eating. “Well, Mom,” Dad suddenly said with a forced jollity that was intended to break the tension, “the Farnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.” “I don’t see why they don’t send an older man!” Mom burst out, as though she had been holding it in"}

They’re stronger and more alert than older men—” His voice trailed off as if he were unable to convince himself. “ Some body has to go,” Marsh said. “Why not a younger man without family and responsibility? That’s why they’re giving younger men more opportunities today than they used to.” “It’s not younger men I’m talking about!” Mom blurted. “It’s you, Marsh!” 12 Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder. “Now, Ruth, we promised not to get excited this morning.” “I’m sorry,” Mom said weakly. “But Marsh is too young to—” She caught herself and put her hand over her mouth. “Stop talking like that!” Dad said. “Marsh is coming back. There’ve been thousands of rockets sent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that every bug has been ironed out before risking a man’s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going up in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn’t it, Marsh?” “I hope so, Dad,” Marsh murmured. Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each brooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed to take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things that he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable feeling, almost as if he were seeing these things for the last as well as the first time. Finally the airport came into view. The guards at the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the Farnsworth car through ahead of scores of others that crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers slipped up close and shot off flash bulbs in Marsh’s eyes. Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had been taken over by the Air Force in recent years and converted into the largest rocket experimental center in the United States. 13 Dad drove up to the building that would be the scene of Marsh’s first exhaustive tests and briefings. He stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their good-by was brief. Marsh saw his father’s mouth quiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He had gone through any number of grueling tests to prove that he could take the rigors of space, but not one of them had prepared him for the hardest moments of parting. When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first to the psychiatrist who checked his condition. “Pulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,” he"}

He had gone through any number of grueling tests to prove that he could take the rigors of space, but not one of them had prepared him for the hardest moments of parting. When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first to the psychiatrist who checked his condition. “Pulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,” he said. “You’re excited, aren’t you, son?” “Yes, sir,” Marsh admitted. “Maybe they’ve got the wrong man, sir. I might fail them.” The doctor grinned. “They don’t have the wrong man,” he said. “They might have, with a so-called iron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension and fears until later, until maybe the moment of blast-off. Then he’d let go, and when he needed his calmest judgment he wouldn’t have it. No, Marshall, there isn’t a man alive who could make this history-making flight without some anxiety. Forget it. You’ll feel better as the day goes on. I’ll see you once more before the blast-off.” Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to the space surgeon, was given a complete physical examination, and was pronounced in perfect condition. Then began his review briefing on everything he would encounter during the flight. 14 Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half before midnight. Since at night, in the Western Hemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications of excessive temperatures in the outer reaches were avoided during the time Marsh would be outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small upper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first two parts would be jettisoned after reaching their peak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would carry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around Earth, along the route that a permanent space station was to be built after the results of the flight were studied. After spending a little while in this orbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey back to Earth, in gliding flight. He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When an officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had been lying on in a private room of General Forsythe, Chief of Space Operations. “It’s almost time, son,” the officer said. “Your CO wants to see you in the outside office.” Marsh went into the adjoining room and found his cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an unusual warmth about the severe gentleman who previously had shown only a firm, uncompromising attitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age, and his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close to his head in regulation neatness. 15 “Well, this is it, Marshall,” the colonel said. “How I envy you this honor of being the first human to enter space. However, I do feel that a part of me is going along too, since I had a small share in preparing you for the trip. If the training was harsh at times, I believe that shortly you will"}

However, I do feel that a part of me is going along too, since I had a small share in preparing you for the trip. If the training was harsh at times, I believe that shortly you will understand the reason for it.” “I didn’t feel that the Colonel was either too soft or strict, sir,” Marsh said diplomatically. A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared loudly in the cool desert night: “X minus forty minutes.” “We can’t talk all night, Marshall,” the colonel said briskly. “You’ve got a job to do. But first, a few of your friends want to wish you luck.” He called into the anteroom, “You may come in, gentlemen!” There filed smartly into the room ten youths who had survived the hard prespace course with Marsh and would be his successors in case he failed tonight. They formed a line and shook hands with Marsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten sick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G’s, then had rallied to pass the test. “Good luck, Marsh,” he said. Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been certain he would wash out during navigation phase in the planetarium. “All the luck in the world, Marsh,” he added. Each cadet brought back a special memory of his training as they passed before him, wishing him success. 16 When they had gone and the speaker outside had announced: “X minus thirty minutes,” the colonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving. Colonel Tregasker was to be Marsh’s escort to the ship. Photographers and newspapermen swarmed about them as they climbed into the jeep that was to take them to the launching site farther out on the field. Questions were flung at the two from all sides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep through the mob and sped off over the asphalt. At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the police had their hands full keeping out thousands of spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off area. The field was choked with a tide of humanity milling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights, both at the airport and in other parts of Phoenix, directed spears of light on the towering rocket that held the interest of all the world tonight. There was one light, far larger than the rest, with powerful condensing lenses and connected to a giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh home from his trip among the stars. A high wire fence surrounded the launching ramp and blockhouses. International scientists and dignitaries with priorities formed a ring around the fence, but even they were not allowed inside the small circle of important activity.

A high wire fence surrounded the launching ramp and blockhouses. International scientists and dignitaries with priorities formed a ring around the fence, but even they were not allowed inside the small circle of important activity. The guards waved the colonel and Marsh through the gate. 17 Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the tiny third stage in which he was to spend his time aloft, but he had never been close to the completely assembled ship until this moment. The three stages had been nicknamed, “Tom,” “Dick,” and “Harry.” Marsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of the great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions to perfect and was as high as a four-story building. The gigantic base, “Big Tom,” was the section that would have the hardest job to do, that of thrusting the rocket through the densest part of the atmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than the other sections. Marsh knew that most of the ship’s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of hydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid. “We’re going into that blockhouse over there,” Colonel Tregasker said. “You’ll don your space gear in there.” First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened to the cadet’s wrists, ankles, nose, and head. Marsh knew this to be one of the most important phases of the flight—to find out a man’s reaction to space flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each wire would telemeter certain information by radio back to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had been put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and rubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh, and then he was ready except for his helmet, which would not be donned until later. 18 Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The open-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the big latticed platform that surrounded the rocket. The two got into the cage, and it rose with them. Marsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension during the activities of the day, but his knees felt rubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried him high above the noisy confusion of the airport. This was it. As they stepped from the cage onto the platform of the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below call out: “X minus twenty minutes.” There were eleven engineers and workmen on the platform readying the compartment that Marsh would occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and alone as he faced the small chamber that might very well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and wires were staggering in their complexity. Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker. “Good-by, sir,” he said in a quavering voice. “I hope I remember everything the Corps taught me.” He tried to smile, but his facial muscles twitched uncontrollably. “Good luck, son—lots of it,” the"}

Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced the youth with a firm, fatherly hug. “This is not regulations,” he mumbled gruffly, “but hang regulations!” He turned quickly and asked to be carried down to the ground. A man brought Marsh’s helmet and placed it over his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs on the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm, pressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and headpiece. 19 Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small compartment. He reclined in the soft contour chair, and the straps were fastened by one of the engineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires connected to various parts of his body had been brought together into a single unit in the helmet. A wire cable leading from the panel was plugged into the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit. Final tests were run off to make sure everything was in proper working order, including the two-way short-wave radio that would have to penetrate the electrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch air lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver, Marsh could hear the final minutes and seconds being called off from inside the blockhouse. “Everything O.K.?” Marsh was asked by someone on the platform. “Yes, sir,” Marsh replied. “Then you’re on your own,” were the final ominous words. “X minus five minutes,” called the speaker. 20 It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could remember. He was painfully aware of his cramped quarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath him that presently would literally blow him sky-high. And he thought of the millions of people the world over who, at this moment, were hovering at radios and TV’s anxiously awaiting the dawn of the space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom, lost in that multitude of night watchers, and among the few who were not primarily concerned with the scientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if he would ever see them again. “X minus sixty seconds!” Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent up, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of smoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear trying to master him, he began reviewing all the things he must remember and, above all, what to do in an emergency. “X minus ten seconds—five—four—three—two—one—FIRE!” There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor. The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer than the gradually built up speed of the whirling centrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into his contour chair."}

As he felt fear trying to master him, he began reviewing all the things he must remember and, above all, what to do in an emergency. “X minus ten seconds—five—four—three—two—one—FIRE!” There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor. The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer than the gradually built up speed of the whirling centrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into his contour chair. It felt as though someone were pressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in his body were clinging to his backbone. But these first moments would be the worst. A gauge showed a force of 7 G’s on him—equal to half a ton. He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial in front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each Mach number represented that much times the speed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an hour. Marsh knew “Big Tom” would blast for about a minute and a half under control of the automatic pilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude of twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a metal mesh ’chute. 21 Marsh’s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature gauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached twenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square of view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of the cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes. Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He heard a rumble and felt a jerk. “Big Tom” was breaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully overcome, and the ship had already begun tilting into its trajectory. There was a new surge of agony on his body as the second stage picked up the acceleration at a force of 7 G’s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the force pulled his lips back from his teeth and dragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers continued to rise—11, 12, 13—to altitude 200 miles, the outer fringe of the earth’s atmosphere. There was a slight lifting of the pressure on his body. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but the sky was getting purple. Mach 14—10,000 miles an hour. “Dick” would jettison any moment. Marsh had been aloft only about four minutes, but it had seemed an age, every tortured second of it. 22 There was another rumble as the second stage broke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath him as his own occupied section, “Harry,” began blasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully weathered those tons of exploding hydrazine and acid that could have reduced him to nothing if something had gone wrong. Although his speed was still building up, the weight on him began to ease steadily as his body’s inertia finally yielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration. The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the peak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour. His altitude was 350 miles—man’s"}

Although his speed was still building up, the weight on him began to ease steadily as his body’s inertia finally yielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration. The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the peak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour. His altitude was 350 miles—man’s highest ascent. Slowly then, the speedometer began to drop back. Marsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as the “lift” fuel was spent and rocket “Harry” began its free-flight orbit around Earth. The ship had reached a speed which exactly counterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could, theoretically, travel this way forever, provided no other outside force acted upon it. The effect on Marsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved of the viselike pressure, his stomach and chest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons. “Cadet Farnsworth,” the voice of General Forsythe spoke into his helmet receiver, “are you all right?” “Yes, sir,” Marsh replied. “That is, I think so.” It was good to hear a human voice again, something to hold onto in this crazy unreal world into which he had been hurtled. “We’re getting the electronic readings from your gauges O.K.,” the voice went on. “The doctor says your pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.” It was queer having your pulse read from 350 miles up in the air. 23 Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly in the “air.” A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed this. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature and wind velocity outside might have astounded him if he were not prepared for the readings. The heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But these figures meant nothing because of the sparseness of air molecules. Temperature and wind applied only to the individual particles, which were thousands of feet apart. “How is your cosmic-ray count?” asked the general. Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel from which clicking sounds were coming. “It’s low, sir. Nothing to worry about.” Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations known, were the only radiation in space that could not be protected against. But in small doses they had been found not to be dangerous. “As soon as our recorders get more of the figures your telemeter is giving us,” the operations chief said, “you can leave the rocket.” When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later, he eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body. He could hardly contain his excitement at being the first person to view the globe of Earth from space. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of zero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it took some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly strange sensation. 24 He had disconnected the cable leading from his helmet to the ship’s transmitter and switched on the"}

He could hardly contain his excitement at being the first person to view the globe of Earth from space. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of zero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it took some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly strange sensation. 24 He had disconnected the cable leading from his helmet to the ship’s transmitter and switched on the ship’s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph the area covered by “Harry.” Then he was ready to go outside. He pressed a button on the wall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated into the narrow alcove and closed the door in the cramped chamber behind him. He watched a gauge, and when it showed normal pressure and temperature again, he opened the outside hatch, closing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the vacuum of space to contact the interior of the ship’s quarters, delicate instruments would have been ruined by the sudden decompression and loss of heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship so that there was no chance of his becoming separated from it. Then he looked “downward,” to experience the thrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the panorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A downy blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the whole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating like phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness of the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for Marsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities extending from horizon to horizon. It gave him an exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all. 25 Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew it was largely his own and the rocket’s fast speed that was responsible for the illusion. As he hung in this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for his cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine, developed only in recent years, simulated the weightlessness of space and trained the cadets for endurance in such artificial conditions. “Describe some of the things you see, Marshall,” General Forsythe said over Marsh’s helmet receiver. “I’ve just cut in a recorder.” “It’s a scene almost beyond description, sir,” Marsh said into the helmet mike. “The sky is thickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very distinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that must be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars is like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon is so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct sun does on earth.” Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond the ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch. He believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at a speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported this to the general. As he brought his eyes down from the more distant fixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a strange thing happened. He was suddenly seized with"}

It had been almost too sudden to catch. He believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at a speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported this to the general. As he brought his eyes down from the more distant fixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a strange thing happened. He was suddenly seized with a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity training had been intended to prepare him against this very thing. A cold sweat come out over his body, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to take hold of him. 26 He made a sudden movement as though to catch himself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in frictionless space and his own weightlessness, he was shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a cracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and then sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship, head foremost. A collision could crack his helmet, exposing his body to decompression, causing him to swell like a balloon and finally explode. In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment did he have the presence of mind to flip his body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up in front of him for protection. His feet bumped against the rocket’s side, and the motion sent him hurtling back out to the end of the safety line again. This back-and-forth action occurred several times before he could stop completely. “I’ve got to be careful,” he panted to himself, as he thought of how close his space career had come to being ended scarcely before it had begun. General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering what had happened. When Marsh had explained and the general seemed satisfied that Marsh had recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his description. His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked down calmly, entranced as the features of the United States passed below his gaze. He named the cities he could identify, also the mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked from 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour’s time, the rocket had traversed the entire country and was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence of the Atlantic. 27 Marsh asked if “Tom” and “Dick” had landed safely. “‘Tom’ landed near Roswell, New Mexico,” General Forsythe told him, “and the ’chute of the second section has been reported seen north of Dallas. I think you’d better start back now, Marshall. It’ll take us many months to analyze all the information we’ve gotten. We can’t contact you very well on the other side of the world either, and thirdly, I don’t want you exposed to the sun’s rays outside the atmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer than can be helped.” Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and floated slowly back toward the ship.

We can’t contact you very well on the other side of the world either, and thirdly, I don’t want you exposed to the sun’s rays outside the atmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer than can be helped.” Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and floated slowly back toward the ship. He entered the air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his contour chair to upright position, facing the console of the ship’s manual controls for the glide Earthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet cable and buckled one of the straps across his waist. Since he was still moving at many thousands of miles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge straight downward. He and the glider would be turned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would have to spend considerable time soaring in and out of the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he reached much lower speed. Then the Earth’s gravitational pull would do the rest. 28 This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation, and the most dangerous. Where before, Marsh had depended on automatic controls to guide him, now much of the responsibility was on his own judgment. He remembered the many hours he had sweated through to log his flying time. Now he could look back on that period in his training and thank his lucky stars for it. He took the manual controls and angled into the atmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial—the atmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had neared the dangerous incendiary point, with the ship having literally become red-hot, he soared into the frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this up a long time in order to reduce his devastating speed. It was something of a shock to him to leave the black midnight of Earth’s slumbering side for the brilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe and Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He would have liked to study this other half of the world which he had glimpsed only a few times before in his supersonic test flights, but he knew this would have to wait for future flights. Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed enough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than the rocket’s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere. At this point, Marsh cut in “Harry’s” forward braking jets to check his falling speed. “There’s something else to worry about,” he thought to himself. “Will old Harry hold together or will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?” 29 The directional radio signals from the powerful Skyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as Marsh neared the shores of California. He could see the winking lights of San Diego and Los Angeles, and farther inland the swinging thread that was the beacon at Skyharbor.

He could see the winking lights of San Diego and Los Angeles, and farther inland the swinging thread that was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his path of flight had been grounded for the past few hours because of the space flight. The only ground light scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon in Phoenix. When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling downward over the state to kill the rest of his altitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a hurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through the night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped summits of the towering San Francisco Peaks on the drive southward, and he recognized the sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then he was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed sand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature of the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage done to the walls and instruments, and possibly to other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside controls might be too warped to give him a good touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely at all. A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing gear. Now the only problem left was to land himself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow parallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport several times as his altitude continued to plummet. 30 The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel was gone now. From here on in, he would be on gliding power alone. “Easy does it, Marshall,” the general said quietly into his ear. “You’re lining up fine. Level it out a little and keep straight with the approach lights. That’s fine. You’re just about in.” The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at him, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground on the west end of the runway. He kept the ship steady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing the last of its once tremendous velocity. The plane hit the restraining wire across the strip and came to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against the single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly, the ship was still and he was safe. He unfastened his strap and removed his space helmet. The heat of the compartment brought the sweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and pressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door flew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth which he had wondered if he would ever inhale again. His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously, as men swarmed over him with congratulations, eager questions, and looks of respect.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a hero...? There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer, one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness. Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen, and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the Galloping Twenties. He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey. He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps he would talk. Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great mariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing, passing, and then the arrival. The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better. They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up, almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had wanted it to be as before. The head of the American Legion and"}

He saw that as soon as the official car let him off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better. They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up, almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had wanted it to be as before. The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him. He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them, their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was still too much the First One to have his gaze met. He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching at a window. And perhaps she had been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door. The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago. Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said, \"It's good to be home!\" Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other arm around him. He kissed her—her neck, her cheek—and all the old jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the and- then -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger. She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\" Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\" So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left Washington. \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_ONE_2#0", "contents": "Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his, a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat down beside him—but she had hesitated. He wasn't being sensitive; she had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him. Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon—but more so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic journey—even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another. The eyes. It always showed in their eyes. He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a way that few ten-year-old faces are. \"How's it going in school?\" he asked. \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\" \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\" \"Pretty good.\" Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\" He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in continent-to-continent experimental flight. They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up. But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer, he waved his hand—it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook—and ran from the room and from the house. He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very tired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd been lying down all the months of the way back. She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\" He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do—make small talk and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him; they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much."}

It was newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire fence around the experimental station. \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile. She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town. You always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it to this bed again.\" \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward. \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom set and I really didn't know—\" She waved her hand, her face white. He was sure then that she had known, and that the beds and the barrier between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket, began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars still showed. He waited for her to leave the room. She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out. He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers. There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen them. Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would keep them from her until they were gone. Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time, he began to understand that there would be many things, previously beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed; Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably changed—because they thought he had changed. He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known before. But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and friends which was, if anything, stronger than before.

Once he could communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be granted to him. He slept."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_ONE_4#0", "contents": "Dinner was at seven p.m. His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate in the dining room at the big table. Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with company present—to describe everything and anything that had happened to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured. This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\" was perhaps the word. They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly, efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said, \"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table. He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move it—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it drop out of sight. So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was, the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being. The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice. \"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before—\" At that point he looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate, mumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it. Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between Joe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt alone—and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or trowel.\" Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of the lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him, and then down to her plate. Mother, who"}

She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him, and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing—his affectionate, effusive mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses—she barely touched his shoulder and fled. So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served—thin, rare slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\" Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going into the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced. Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room. He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big right fist—Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear of, that he could have smashed more than a table. Edith said, \"Hank!\" He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of the lot of you.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_ONE_5#0", "contents": "Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear—\" He didn't answer. She began to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\" and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him. He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special dessert she'd been preparing half the day—a magnificent English trifle. She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said, \"Hey, I promised—\" \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or something; anything to get away from your father.\" Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\" Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening together—talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\" Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\" Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I want to. The question is whether you want to.\" They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their eyes—his wife's and son's eyes—could not meet his, and so he said he was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that they shouldn't count on him for normal social life. He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes. But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled, and it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\" He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming. Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down!"}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_ONE_6#0", "contents": "It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded very much the way he always had—soft spoken and full of laughter and full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had—so much more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer. They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana. There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world. At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he said, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her face—pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going to be sick. \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up. They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted. And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied, mechanical dancing doll. The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said, \"Beddy-bye time.\" Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\" He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't. Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her face—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding.

They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's the most popular place on earth?\" Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas . \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\" Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—\" Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\" Phil said, \"Because people are—\" And then he caught himself and waved his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\" \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting tombstones. The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home—or that's what everyone seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or another monster from the movies.\" Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\" The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path and entered the house."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIRST_ONE_7#0", "contents": "\"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry—\" \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll all work out in time.\" \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening. I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're frightened.\" \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as necessary. For good if need be.\" \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\" That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him, even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did. \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I did—seven months ago next Wednesday—he's going to be next. He was smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered, he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and organ process—the process that made it all possible. So people have to get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\" Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—\" She paused. \"There's one question.\" He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by everyone from the president of the United States on down. \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half months—slept without dreaming.\" She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was satisfied. Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own home. THE END"}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] His name was Herrell McCray and he was scared. As best he could tell, he was in a sort of room no bigger than a prison cell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business in it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump from Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray was ship's navigator, plotting course corrections—not that there were any, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings were made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth angles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon stars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the locking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had done it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel and Saiph ... it happened. The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a collection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes and a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something that rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered hollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled dangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right through his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched it. McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out. Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not quite utter silence. Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something like a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as still as he could, listening; it remained elusive. Probably it was only an illusion. But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud. It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get from a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on Starship Jodrell Bank to this damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to hurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in exasperation: \"If I could only see !\" He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like baker's dough, not at all resilient. A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He was looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_2#0", "contents": "It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was the light? And what were these other things in the room? Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like having tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was looking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could see made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct a logical explanation for that with no trouble—maybe a subspace meteorite striking the Jodrell Bank , an explosion, himself knocked out, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more holes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational. How to explain a set of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the chemistry set—or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric that, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing suit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of the objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair—why, he'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old enough to go to school. But what were they doing here? Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were strange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were not papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made of some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or processed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light. But they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"—the color of aged driftwood or unbleached cloth. Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth wall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings; from them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be ventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse than what he already had. McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a little light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his courage flowed back when he could see again. He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago—subjectively it seemed to be minutes—he had been aboard the Jodrell Bank with nothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting one of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being shaken up and—he admitted it—scared damn near witless, he did not seem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what had happened to him, but what had happened to the ship? He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been an accident to the Jodrell Bank . He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a cooling brain. McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow refreshed him, like icewater"}

Suppose there had been an accident to the Jodrell Bank . He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a cooling brain. McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow refreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head he remembered what a spacesuit was good for. It held a radio. He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest of the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he said, \"calling the Jodrell Bank .\" No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling Jodrell Bank . \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\" But there was no answer. Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio, something more than a million times faster than light, with a range measured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer, he was a good long way from anywhere. Of course, the thing might not be operating. He reached for the microphone again— He cried aloud. The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than before. For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped his eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in the pinkish glimmer; but the hand—his own hand, cupped to hold the microphone—he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting moment of study, his chest. McCray could not see any part of his own body at all. II Someone else could. Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination of a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new antibiotic—and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked, sailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that may contain food. Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\") Hatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but it did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in any way look like a human being, but they had features in common. If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance, they might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an adventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences of his culture. Both enjoyed games—McCray baseball, poker and three-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human description. Both held positions of some importance—considering their ages—in the affairs of their respective worlds. Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot, hard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were not organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which obeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes curl; but they did not touch"}

He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were not organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which obeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes curl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well a yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested in the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater distances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of Inverse Squares. Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\" which had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little excited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on various errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest limbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a state of violent commotion. The probe team had had a shock. \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the others mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the specimen from Earth. After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman. \"Incredible—but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch him,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to watch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of them could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of a creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as Herrell McCray."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_3#0", "contents": "Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure in which he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of all probes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once. Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report: \"The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began to inspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his own members in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure. After observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unable to see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him. \"This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relatively undisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact, manipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we had provided for him. \"He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organs in his breathing passage. \"Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificial skin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.\" The supervising council rocked with excitement. \"You're sure?\" demanded one of the councilmen. \"Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forces now, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulating a carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by the vibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.\" \"Fantastic,\" breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. \"How about communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?\" \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but we thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\" The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. It was not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left in the probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was going on—knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in the dark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room for him briefly and again produced the rising panic. Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back. \"Stop fidgeting,\" commanded the council leader abruptly. \"Hatcher, you are to establish communication at once.\" \"But, sir....\" Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly; he would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesture with. \"We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homey for him—\" actually, what he said was more like, we've warmed the biophysical nuances of his enclosure —\"and tried to guess his needs; and we're frightening him half to death. We can't go faster. This creature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormal forces—heat, light, kinetic energy—for his life. His chemistry is not ours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism is closer to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.\" \"Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatures were intelligent.\" \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\" \"But in a way, and you must learn that way. I know.\""}

In your first report you stated these creatures were intelligent.\" \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\" \"But in a way, and you must learn that way. I know.\" One lobster-claw shaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itself in an admonitory gesture. \"You want time. But we don't have time, Hatcher. Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Masses team has just turned in a most alarming report.\" \"Have they secured a subject?\" Hatcher demanded jealously. The councillor paused. \"Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their subjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.\" There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. The council room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spoke again, each council member poised over his locus-point, his members drifting about him. Finally the councillor said, \"I speak for all of us, I think. If the Old Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerably narrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all. You must do everything you can to establish communication with your subject.\" \"But the danger to the specimen—\" Hatcher protested automatically. \"—is no greater,\" said the councillor, \"than the danger to every one of us if we do not find allies now .\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_4#0", "contents": "Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily. It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a reputation for demanding results at any cost—even at the cost of destroying the only thing you had that would make results possible. Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot be said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy that caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward communication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting physical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But Hatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough getting him here. Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of his team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he took time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not entirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his body opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which Hatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the eating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture of kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for another day. He returned quickly to the room. His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers reported—nothing new—and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the council. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his staff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but decided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other hand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was not lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat of the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical beings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in ages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and hiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it—with its population—as a decoy, had they arrived at all. Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near the spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they had begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of fleeing again. But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their existence to their enemies— \"Hatcher!\" The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his second in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded. \"Wait....\" Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something was about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to him for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted themselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into his own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had just taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\" At what passed"}

Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a cathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to show. Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And—is it a different species? Or merely a different sex?\" \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited. Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless. \"No matter,\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\" And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We may be in the process of killing our first one now.\" \"Killing him, Hatcher?\" Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like puppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to go into Stage Two of the project at once.\" III Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun, he had an inspiration. The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been and groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to have. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed it. Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything—even himself. \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that pinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now that he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects on some strange property of the light. At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two. He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening. For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and almost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was gone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had hardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was, perhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very faint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss. McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no change. And yet, surely, it was warmer in here. He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell one. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger now. He stood there, perplexed. A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply, amazement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you?

I don't know—\" \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is Jodrell Bank calling. Answer, please!\" \"I am answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\" \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell Bank responding to your message, acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\" It kept on, and on. McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they didn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or—no. That was not it; they had heard him, because they were responding. But it seemed to take them so long.... Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his mind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was it he called them? Two hours ago? Three? Did that mean—did it possibly mean—that there was a lag of an hour or two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his suit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took hours to get a message to the ship and back? And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?"}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_5#0", "contents": "Herrell McCray was a navigator, which is to say, a man who has learned to trust the evidence of mathematics and instrument readings beyond the guesses of his \"common sense.\" When Jodrell Bank , hurtling faster than light in its voyage between stars, made its regular position check, common sense was a liar. Light bore false witness. The line of sight was trustworthy directly forward and directly after—sometimes not even then—and it took computers, sensing their data through instruments, to comprehend a star bearing and convert three fixes into a position. If the evidence of his radio contradicted common sense, common sense was wrong. Perhaps it was impossible to believe what the radio's message implied; but it was not necessary to \"believe,\" only to act. McCray thumbed down the transmitter button and gave a concise report of his situation and his guesses. \"I don't know how I got here. I don't know how long I've been gone, since I was unconscious for a time. However, if the transmission lag is a reliable indication—\" he swallowed and went on—\"I'd estimate I am something more than five hundred light-years away from you at this moment. That's all I have to say, except for one more word: Help.\" He grinned sourly and released the button. The message was on its way, and it would be hours before he could have a reply. Therefore he had to consider what to do next. He mopped his brow. With the droning, repetitious call from the ship finally quiet, the room was quiet again. And warm. Very warm, he thought tardily; and more than that. The halogen stench was strong in his nostrils again. Hurriedly McCray scrambled into the suit. By the time he was sealed down he was coughing from the bottom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps that pained him, uncontrollable. Chlorine or fluorine, one of them was in the air he had been breathing. He could not guess where it had come from; but it was ripping his lungs out. He flushed the interior of the suit out with a reckless disregard for the wastage of his air reserve, holding his breath as much as he could, daring only shallow gasps that made him retch and gag. After a long time he could breathe, though his eyes were spilling tears. He could see the fumes in the room now. The heat was building up. Automatically—now that he had put it on and so started its servo-circuits operating—the suit was cooling him. This was a deep-space suit, regulation garb when going outside the pressure hull of an FTL ship. It was good up to at least five hundred degrees in thin air, perhaps three or four hundred in dense. In thin air or in space it was the elastic joints and couplings that depolymerized when the heat grew too great; in dense air, with conduction pouring energy in faster than the cooling coils could suck it out and hurl it away, it was the refrigerating equipment that broke down.

{"chunk_id": "THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_6#0", "contents": "Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax, tungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft. McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his gauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the man who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something concrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had been brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could, do next; all those questions could recede into the background of his mind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned oven. Crash-clang! The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his gauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see the plastic—or whatever it was—of the door. It was chipping out. Not easily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white powdery residue. At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through it. Did he have an hour? But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it must have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar. McCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide. He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare. McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it as nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out, but it would retard them. The room was again unlighted—at least to McCray's eyes. There was not even that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing but the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were evidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been cupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have been workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not possible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them. Some were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended from the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these benches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants or shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the back of his neck. He tapped half-heartedly at one of the closed cupboards, and was not surprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he could batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of its contents when he was through; and there was the question of time. But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches. Metallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a stiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar.

But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches. Metallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a stiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he thought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun. In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even a couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked beside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen in survival locker, on the Jodrell Bank —and abruptly wished he were carrying now—but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange assortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had been more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was prepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard. The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals all along: \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is Jodrell Bank calling Herrell McCray....\" And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits toned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in panic and fear: \" Jodrell Bank! Where are you? Help!\" IV Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first survival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\" \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and a troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and seemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher, it was something far more immediate to his interests. \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\" His assistant vibrated startlement. \"I know,\" Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight toward her.\" Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but he did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was cause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty, needed so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved much better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at the queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers. Hatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and death. He said, musing: \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get—almost—a whisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this female is perhaps not quite mute.\" \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\" Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well. Remember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he is alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with the female—\" \"But?\" \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\""}

He located her direction easily enough, shielding the tiny built-in antenna with the tungsten-steel blade of the ax, while she begged him to hurry. Her voice was heavily accented, with some words in a language he did not recognize. She seemed to be in shock. McCray was hardly surprised at that; he had been close enough to shock himself. He tried to reassure her as he searched for a way out of the hall, but in the middle of a word her voice stopped. He hesitated, hefting the ax, glancing back at the way he had come. There had to be a way out, even if it meant chopping through a wall. When he turned around again there was a door. It was oddly shaped and unlike the door he had hewn through, but clearly a door all the same, and it was open. McCray regarded it grimly. He went back in his memory with meticulous care. Had he not looked at, this very spot a matter of moments before? He had. And had there been an open door then? There had not. There hadn't been even a shadowy outline of the three-sided, uneven opening that stood there now. Still, it led in the proper direction. McCray added one more inexplicable fact to his file and walked through. He was in another hall—or tunnel—rising quite steeply to the right. By his reckoning it was the proper direction. He labored up it, sweating under the weight of the suit, and found another open door, this one round, and behind it— Yes, there was the woman whose voice he had heard. It was a woman, all right. The voice had been so strained that he hadn't been positive. Even now, short black hair might not have proved it, and she was lying face down but the waist and hips were a woman's, even though she wore a bulky, quilted suit of coveralls. He knelt beside her and gently turned her face. She was unconscious. Broad, dark face, with no make-up; she was apparently in her late thirties. She appeared to be Chinese. She breathed, a little raggedly but without visible discomfort; her face was relaxed as though she were sleeping. She did not rouse as he moved her. He realized she was breathing the air of the room they were in. His instant first thought was that she was in danger of asphyxiation;"}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"It is rather unusual,\" Magnan said, \"to assign an officer of your rank to courier duty, but this is an unusual mission.\" Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grew awkward, Magnan went on. \"There are four planets in the group,\" he said. \"Two double planets, all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They're called Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti have been penetrating. \"Now—\" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—\"we have learned that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met no opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they intend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force.\" Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drew carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned. \"This is open aggression, Retief,\" he said, \"in case I haven't made myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien species. Obviously, we can't allow it.\" Magnan drew a large folder from his desk. \"A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately, Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They're farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war potential, by conventional standards, is nil.\" Magnan tapped the folder before him. \"I have here,\" he said solemnly, \"information which will change that picture completely.\" He leaned back and blinked at Retief."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_FROZEN_PLANET_2#0", "contents": "\"All right, Mr. Councillor,\" Retief said. \"I'll play along; what's in the folder?\" Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down. \"First,\" he said. \"The Soetti War Plan—in detail. We were fortunate enough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegade Terrestrials who've been advising the Soetti.\" He folded another finger. \"Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen's people, worked out by the Theory group.\" He wrestled a third finger down. \"Lastly; an Utter Top Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-acceleration field into a potent weapon—a development our systems people have been holding in reserve for just such a situation.\" \"Is that all?\" Retief said. \"You've still got two fingers sticking up.\" Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away. \"This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, this information could be catastrophic. You'll memorize it before you leave this building.\" \"I'll carry it, sealed,\" Retief said. \"That way nobody can sweat it out of me.\" Magnan started to shake his head. \"Well,\" he said. \"If it's trapped for destruction, I suppose—\" \"I've heard of these Jorgensen's Worlds,\" Retief said. \"I remember an agent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard with cards and dice. Never played for money, though.\" \"Umm,\" Magnan said. \"Don't make the error of personalizing this situation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of these backwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow its natural course, as always.\" \"When does this attack happen?\" \"Less than four weeks.\" \"That doesn't leave me much time.\" \"I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far as Aldo Cerise. You'll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the rest of the way.\" \"That's a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don't make it?\" Magnan looked sour. \"Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to put all our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you is not misplaced.\" \"This antiac conversion; how long does it take?\" \"A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. The Jorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic of some sort.\" Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the tickets inside. \"Less than four hours to departure time,\" he said. \"I'd better not start any long books.\" \"You'd better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination,\" Magnan said. Retief stood up. \"If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.\" \"The allusion escapes me,\" Magnan said coldly. \"And one last word. The Soetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen's Worlds; don't get yourself interned.\" \"I'll tell you what,\" Retief said soberly. \"In a pinch, I'll mention your name.\" \"You'll be traveling with Class X credentials,\" Magnan snapped. \"There must be nothing to connect you with the Corps.\" \"They'll never guess,\" Retief said. \"I'll pose as a gentleman.\" \"You'd better be getting started,\" Magnan said, shuffling papers. \"You're right,\" Retief said. \"If I work at it, I might manage a snootful by"}

What do you want with it?\" \"Just a feeling I've got.\" \"Please yourself.\" \"Some day,\" Retief said, \"I may take you up on that.\" II Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on the counter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legend \"ALDO CERISE—INTERPLANETARY.\" A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouse and a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watching Retief from the corner of his eye. Retief glanced at him. The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth and spat it on the floor. \"Was there something?\" he said. \"Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group,\" Retief said. \"Is it on schedule?\" The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. \"Filled up. Try again in a couple of weeks.\" \"What time does it leave?\" \"I don't think—\" \"Let's stick to facts,\" Retief said. \"Don't try to think. What time is it due out?\" The clerk smiled pityingly. \"It's my lunch hour,\" he said. \"I'll be open in an hour.\" He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it. \"If I have to come around this counter,\" Retief said, \"I'll feed that thumb to you the hard way.\" The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief's eye, closed his mouth and swallowed. \"Like it says there,\" he said, jerking a thumb at the board. \"Lifts in an hour. But you won't be on it,\" he added. Retief looked at him. \"Some ... ah ... VIP's required accommodation,\" he said. He hooked a finger inside the sequined collar. \"All tourist reservations were canceled. You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship next—\" \"Which gate?\" Retief said. \"For ... ah...?\" \"For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds,\" Retief said. \"Well,\" the clerk said. \"Gate 19,\" he added quickly. \"But—\" Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign reading To Gates 16-30 . \"Another smart alec,\" the clerk said behind him."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_FROZEN_PLANET_3#0", "contents": "Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a covered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man with a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled gray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him. \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered. Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over. The guard blinked at it. \"Whassat?\" \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter says he's out to lunch.\" The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back against the handrail. \"On your way, bub,\" he said. Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a right into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and went to his knees. \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked past while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped over the man and went up the gangway into the ship. A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor. \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked. \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way along the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven. The door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the floor. It was expensive looking baggage. Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall, florid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in the open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man clamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder. \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as he backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared. \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear out of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\" \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\" \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr. Tony's room.\" \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\" \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief sat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in the corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an oversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it, glanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned. \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown out?\" Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a handle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved the trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the door. \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the far wall of the corridor and burst. Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the"}

A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a blue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye stared at Retief. \"Is this the joker?\" he grated. The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted, \"That's him, sure.\" \"I'm captain of this vessel,\" the first man said. \"You've got two minutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.\" \"When you can spare the time from your other duties,\" Retief said, \"take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code. That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in interplanetary commerce.\" \"A space lawyer.\" The captain turned. \"Throw him out, boys.\" Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief. \"Go on, pitch him out,\" the captain snapped. Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk. \"Don't try it,\" he said softly. One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and stepped forward, then hesitated. \"Hey,\" he said. \"This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?\" \"That's him,\" the thick-necked man called. \"Spilled Mr. Tony's possessions right on the deck.\" \"Deal me out,\" the bouncer said. \"He can stay put as long as he wants to. I signed on to move cargo. Let's go, Moe.\" \"You'd better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,\" Retief said. \"We're due to lift in twenty minutes.\" The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The Captain's voice prevailed. \"—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?\" \"Close the door as you leave,\" Retief said. The thick-necked man paused at the door. \"We'll see you when you come out.\" III Four waiters passed Retief's table without stopping. A fifth leaned against the wall nearby, a menu under his arm. At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform and with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male passengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional glances Retief's way. A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair. Bright blue eyes peered out from under a white chef's cap. \"Givin' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?\" \"Looks like it, old-timer,\" Retief said. \"Maybe I'd better go join the skipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.\" \"Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.\" \"I see your point.\" \"You set right where you're at, Mister. I'll rustle you up a plate.\" Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed up with mushrooms and garlic butter. \"I'm Chip,\" the chef said. \"I don't like the Cap'n. You can tell him I said so. Don't like his friends, either. Don't like them dern Sweaties, look at a man like he was a worm.\" \"You've got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip.

And you've got the right idea on the Soetti, too,\" Retief said. He poured red wine into a glass. \"Here's to you.\" \"Dern right,\" Chip said. \"Dunno who ever thought up broiling 'em. Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert. You like brandy in yer coffee?\" \"Chip, you're a genius.\" \"Like to see a feller eat,\" Chip said. \"I gotta go now. If you need anything, holler.\" Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to Jorgensen's Worlds. Then, if Magnan's information was correct, there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a temptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It would be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against. Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and coffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony and his retainers still sat at the Captain's table. As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across the room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took a cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted end in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth. The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing. \"You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad,\" the thug said in a grating voice. \"What's your game, hick?\" Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up. \"I don't think I want my coffee,\" he said. He looked at the thug. \"You drink it.\" The thug squinted at Retief. \"A wise hick,\" he began. With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug's face, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug went down. Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed. \"You can take your playmates away now, Tony,\" he said. \"And don't bother to come around yourself. You're not funny enough.\" Mr. Tony found his voice. \"Take him, Marbles!\" he growled. The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a long-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in. Retief heard the panel open beside him. \"Here you go, Mister,\" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed french knife lay on the sill. \"Thanks, Chip,\" Retief said. \"I won't need it for these punks.\" Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him under the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol from his shoulder holster. \"Aim that at me, and I'll kill you,\" Retief said."}

Behind him, the captain appeared, white-faced. \"Put that away, you!\" he yelled. \"What kind of—\" \"Shut up,\" Mr. Tony said. \"Put it away, Hoany. We'll fix this bum later.\" \"Not on this vessel, you won't,\" the captain said shakily. \"I got my charter to consider.\" \"Ram your charter,\" Hoany said harshly. \"You won't be needing it long.\" \"Button your floppy mouth, damn you!\" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at the man on the floor. \"Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the slob.\" He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came up. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room. The panel opened. \"I usta be about your size, when I was your age,\" Chip said. \"You handled them pansies right. I wouldn't give 'em the time o' day.\" \"How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?\" Retief said. \"Sure, Mister. Anything else?\" \"I'll think of something,\" Retief said. \"This is shaping up into one of those long days.\""}

What have they got against my going to Jorgensen's Worlds?\" \"Dunno. Hasn't been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I sure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was yer age.\" \"I'll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen's Worlds like?\" \"One of 'em's cold as hell and three of 'em's colder. Most o' the Jorgies live on Svea; that's the least froze up. Man don't enjoy eatin' his own cookin' like he does somebody else's.\" \"That's where I'm lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo's the captain got aboard for Jorgensen's?\" \"Derned if I know. In and out o' there like a grasshopper, ever few weeks. Don't never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says. Don't know what we even run in there for.\" \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\" \"To Alabaster. That's nine days' run in-sector from Jorgensen's. You ain't got another one of them cigars, have you?\" \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\" \"Plenty o' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed the cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and brandy. \"Them Sweaties is what I don't like,\" he said. Retief looked at him questioningly. \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin' devils. Skinny legs, like a lobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin' head. You can see the pulse beatin' when they get riled.\" \"I've never had the pleasure,\" Retief said. \"You prob'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip out. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin'.\" There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor. \"I ain't superstitious ner nothin',\" Chip said. \"But I'll be triple-damned if that ain't them boarding us now.\" Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door, accompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy knock shook the door. \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\" \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door. \"Come in, damn you,\" he said. A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like feet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set compound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees. Behind the alien, the captain hovered nervously. \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien rasped. \"Who's your friend, Captain?\" Retief said. \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\" \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien said again. \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I've seen it.

They'll kill us!\" the captain gasped, staring at the figure flopping on the floor. \"Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,\" Retief said. \"Tell him to pass the word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in Terrestrial space.\" \"Hey,\" Chip said. \"He's quit kicking.\" The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close and sniffed. \"He's dead.\" The captain stared at Retief. \"We're all dead men,\" he said. \"These Soetti got no mercy.\" \"They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.\" \"They got no more emotions than a blue crab—\" \"You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back. We know their secret now.\" \"What secret? I—\" \"Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Sweaties die easy; that's the secret.\" \"Maybe you got a point,\" the captain said, looking at Retief. \"All they got's a three-man scout. It could work.\" He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien gingerly into the hall. \"Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,\" the captain said, looking back from the door. \"But I'll be back to see you later.\" \"You don't scare us, Cap'n,\" Chip said. \"Him and Mr. Tony and all his goons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' these Sweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.\" \"You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in your getting involved in my problems.\" \"They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That's where we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.\" \"They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.\" \"They don't scare me none.\" Chip picked up the tray. \"I'll scout around a little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything about that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't try nothin' close to port.\" \"Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't do anything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.\" Chip looked at Retief. \"You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much. You didn't come out here for fun, did you?\" \"That,\" Retief said, \"would be a hard one to answer.\" IV Retief awoke at a tap on his door. \"It's me, Mister. Chip.\" \"Come on in.\" The chef entered the room, locking the door. \"You shoulda had that door locked.\" He stood by the door, listening, then turned to Retief. \"You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?\" \"That's right, Chip.\" \"Mr."}

Took the cap'n in his cabin and talked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap'n come out and give some orders to the Mate.\" Retief sat up and reached for a cigar. \"Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?\" \"He hated Skaw's guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got a gun?\" \"A 2mm needler. Why?\" \"The orders cap'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We're by-passin' Jorgensen's Worlds. We'll feel the course change any minute.\" Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out a short-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip. \"Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain's cabin?\""}

Don't try to change course.\" The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key. \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across the desk, gripped the captain's wrist. \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly. \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he eased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the drawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike. \"You busted it, you—\" \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\" \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\" \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley hoods.\" \"You can't put it over, hick.\" \"Tell him.\" The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\" he said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped the mike and looked up at Retief. \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going to sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\" Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door. \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's going on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with a sick friend.\" \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\" \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded. Retief settled himself in a chair. \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to stay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\" The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark. \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel like dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.\" Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him. \"If anything happens that I don't like,\" he said, \"I'll wake you up.

But they erred in thinking the Old Ones were too big to be clever. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1949. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes, and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's radial velocity changed relative to the Quest III , as for forty hours the ship had decelerated. They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the Quest III drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown sated with the sight of wonders—of multiple systems of giant stars, of nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years. But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the Quest III's crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might lie at the long journey's end. For the Quest III was coming home; the sun ahead was the Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_2#0", "contents": "Knof Llud, the Quest III's captain, came slowly down the narrow stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber, a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was little more than a hollow shell. Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've sighted Earth.\" A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on, \"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has identified it—no more.\" But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears were forgotten and exaltation prevailed. Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment. He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do you feel, Lesra?\" She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer.... He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\" \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone by— there —and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\" The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't worry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage.\" But his face had hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge. There's a new course to be set now—for Earth.\" He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes gleamed with unshed tears. Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat that ate the canary.

Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to Earth. Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted before we get that far.\" Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\" Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any of the other Quests returned successful, or if they returned at all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's possible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been forgotten altogether.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_3#0", "contents": "He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he sat idle, alone with his thoughts. The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained. There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find Lesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either. He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the Quest III's fuel stores and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old. Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred Earth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and months had passed for the Quest III in interstellar flight while years and decades had raced by on the home world. Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about three dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a report to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were still interested. Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He slid it onto the reproducer. His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and confident than he knew it was now. \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time since leaving Earth. \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony. \"Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time. \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth; friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the Quest ships will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream, humanity's dream, lives"}

Our generation's dream, humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\" Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still have been ringing in his ears. He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another, later, one. \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that that system, too, is devoid of planets. \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably true—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we may complete our search without finding even one new Earth. \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan.... This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless and transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids, or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the twentieth century. \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was in sight—so we launched the Quests . Perhaps our effort will prove as futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward, expanding limitlessly into the Universe.... \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_4#0", "contents": "Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first disappointments. He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange longing.... \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula. \"According to plan, the Quest III has reached its furthest point from Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more stars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined already. \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead along the Milky Way. \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away.... \"Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the Quest III could achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory. \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other Quests , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization—if the other expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from overpopulation. \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be forgotten back there? \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that was once 'home' has probably been swept away.... \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\" Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing. The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them once in translation from the ancient English...."}

The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able to alter that. He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he would want to do that, though. Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed to falter one moment in flight."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_6#0", "contents": "The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea what it had been—a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have been done. The Quest III's collision armor was nonmaterial and for practical purposes invulnerable. Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled, frowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence, maybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed. He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded cat. \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain, we're being attacked!\" \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically, then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis. There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said, \"Now—attacked by what?\" \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the Quest III's framework. The navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them long enough to tell much.\" \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\" In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were big; he had heard his father's words. \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you, huh, Dad?\" Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\" He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match. There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts. Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The Quest III shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity. To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge, most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof Llud. \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\" Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and they're all banging away at us.\" The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice from the same position.

Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently. His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in his father. \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they can't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some bigger stuff.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_7#0", "contents": "The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges, would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting the Quest III's shell was doing it at velocities where the distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist. But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by the impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its deflection was negligible. The people in the Quest III would have felt nothing at all of the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities, was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation. One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in wait for us. But why on Earth—\" \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why—on Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\" The Quest III bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking, always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn apart. Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was paying attention to him. The men on the Quest III's bridge looked questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored too direct a hit.\" He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the Quest III , except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance and speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than Gwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man. Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting. \"Robot craft,"}

Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting. \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy they had explored, but one of the other Quests might have encountered and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to conquer."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_8#0", "contents": "It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind it. Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight hours.\" \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully. \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\" \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not knowing why we're being attacked.\" Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological advantage, too!\" His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have noticed it.\" \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he hadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts swinging wild and then you nail him.\" Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I was going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\" And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies, repeating on each the same brief recorded message: \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition Quest III ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and querying again, \"Who are you ?\" There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the Quest III too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of his ship. Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time, Captain—I've got some data on Earth now.\" Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up inquiringly at Zost Relyul. \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully. \"First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces of cities, canals, and the like—but it does not. \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the vegetation there"}

But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine moss or even a coarse mold.\" \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud. \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well—we tried photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is opaque to it.\" The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps you can answer some of these riddles before—\" \" We know who you are ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a strange accent, \" and pleading will do you no good. \""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIANTS_RETURN_9#0", "contents": "Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating tape. He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you continue toward Earth.\" Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it had already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that it was not as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the Quest III's ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them. He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \" Are you human? \" The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are not.\" The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply. Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully into its field. \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud woodenly. He named a vision frequency. \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the Quest I's commander.\" Knof Llud stiffened. The Quest I , launched toward Arcturus and the star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the Quest III the most hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to him?\" \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\" Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly, but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the Quest III , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head. He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\" \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question. Why do you want to kill"}

I \"The beasts aren't much help, are they?\" Karl Allen snatched a breath of air and gave another heave on the line tied to the raft of parampa logs bobbing in the middle of the river. \"No,\" he grunted, \"they're not. They always balk at a time like this, when they can see it'll be hard work.\" Joseph Hill wiped his plump face and coiled some of the rope's slack around his thick waist. \"Together now, Karl. One! Two! \" They stood knee-deep in mud on the bank, pulling and straining on the rope, while some few yards distant, in the shade of a grove of trees, their tiny yllumphs nibbled grass and watched them critically, but made no effort to come closer. \"If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the list.\" Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope. \"That's what I've been thinking about,\" he said, worried. They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft bobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened to tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of it solidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling, rushing waters, but that didn't matter. They'd be back in ten hours or so, long before the heavy raft could be washed free. \"How much time have we got, Karl?\" The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical eye at them. He estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to help beach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put down at Landing City. \"Two hours, maybe a little more,\" he stated hastily when Hill looked more worried. \"Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for our numbers on the list.\" He turned back to the raft, untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. He cinched his saddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it. Hill watched him curiously. \"What are you taking the furs for? This isn't the trading rocket.\" \"I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and maybe she'll appreciate the coverings then.\" \"You never would have thought of it yourself,\" Hill grunted. \"Grundy must have told you to do it, the old fool. If you ask me, the less you give them, the less they'll come to expect. Once you spoil them, they'll expect you to do all the trapping and the farming and the family-raising yourself.\" \"You didn't have to sign up,\" Karl pointed out."}

They'll all have to work the farms and raise families.\" Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling up and headed into the thick forest."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_GIRLS_FROM_EARTH_2#0", "contents": "It was quiet as Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making that night. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to. And it would be good to have somebody to help with the trapping and tanning, somebody who could tend the small vegetable garden at the rear of his shack and mend his socks and wash his clothes and cook his meals. And it was time, he thought soberly, that he started to raise a family. He was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children. \"You going to raise a litter, Joe?\" Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the same thing. \"One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,\" Hill answered defensively. \"Need some kids to cut the trees, a couple more to pole them down the river, some to run the mill itself and maybe one to sell the lumber in Landing City. Can't do it all myself.\" He paused a moment, thinking over something that had just occurred to him. \"I've been thinking of your plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe I ought to have one for my wife to take care of, too.\" Karl chuckled. \"I don't think she'll have the time!\" They left the leafy expanse of the forest and entered the grasslands that sloped toward Landing City. He could even see Landing City itself on the horizon, a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy streets, and the small rocket port—a scorched thirty acres or so fenced off with barbed wire. Karl looked out of the corner of his eye at Hill and felt a vague wave of uneasiness. Hill was a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and bristly stubble of a man who was used to living alone and who liked it. But once he took a wife, he would probably have to keep himself in clean clothes and shave every few days. It was even possible that the woman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut. The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto the main path from the small side trails. Hill broke the silence first. \"I wonder what they'll be like.\" Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly. \"They're Earthwomen, Joe. Earth! \" It was easy to act as though he had some inside information, but Karl had to admit to himself that he actually knew very little about it. He was a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman. He had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket office, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed disturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted broadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the stories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing definite to offer, no real facts at all."}

He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the stories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing definite to offer, no real facts at all. Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival spirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet; and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in yllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember. \"They say they're good workers,\" Hill said. Karl nodded. \"Pretty, too.\" They threaded their way through the crowded and muddy streets. Landing City wasn't big, compared to some of the cities on Altair, where he had been raised, but Karl was proud of it. Some day it would be as big as any city on any planet—maybe even have a population of ten thousand people or more. \"Joe,\" Karl said suddenly, \"what's supposed to make women from Earth better than women from any other world?\" Hill located a faint itch and frowned. \"I don't know, Karl. It's hard to say. They're—well, sophisticated, glamorous.\" Karl absorbed this in silence. Those particular qualities were, he thought, rather hard to define. The battered shack that served as rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office on Midplanet loomed up in front of them. There was a crowd gathered in front of the building and they forced their way through to see what had caused it. \"We saw this the last time we were here,\" Hill said. \"I know,\" Karl agreed, \"but I want to take another look.\" He was anxious to glean all the information that he could. It was a poster of a beautiful woman leaning toward the viewer. The edges of the poster were curling and the colors had faded during the last six months, but the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever. She held a long-stemmed goblet in one hand and was blowing a kiss to her audience with the other. Her green eyes sparkled, her smile was provocative. A quoted sentence read: \"I'm from Earth !\" There was nothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to which the colonial office was sending the women. She was real pretty, Karl thought. A little on the thin side, maybe, and the dress she was wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet, but she had a certain something. Glamour, maybe? A loudspeaker blared. \"All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers! All colonists....\" There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly moving line.

A loudspeaker blared. \"All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers! All colonists....\" There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly moving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out little blue slips with numbers on them, pausing every now and then to tell them some entertaining bit of information about the women. He had a great imagination, nothing else. Karl drew the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the landing field that had been decorated with bunting and huge welcome signs for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with government pamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went over and stuffed a few in his pockets. Other tables had been set out and were loaded with luncheon food, fixed by the few colonial women in the community. Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wondering how the girls from Earth would compare with them. He fingered the ticket in his pocket. What would the woman be like who had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the rocket? For when it landed, they would pair up by numbers. The method had its drawbacks, of course, but time was much too short to allow even a few days of getting acquainted. He'd have to get back to his trapping lines and he imagined that Hill would have to get back to his sawmill and the others to their farms. What the hell, you never knew what you were getting either way, till it was too late. \"Sandwich, mister? Pop?\" Karl flipped the boy a coin, picked up some food and a drink, and wandered over to the landing field with Hill. There were still ten minutes or so to go before the rocket landed, but he caught himself straining his sight at the blue sky, trying to see a telltale flicker of exhaust flame. The field was crowded and he caught some of the buzzing conversation. \"... never knew one myself, but let me tell you....\" \"... knew a fellow once who married one, never had a moment's rest afterward....\" \"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture....\" \"... I'd give a lot to know the girl who's got number twenty-five....\" \"Let's meet back here with the girls who have picked our numbers,\" Hill said. \"Maybe we could trade.\" Karl nodded, though privately he felt that the number system was just as good as depending on first impressions. There was a murmur from the crowd and he found his gaze riveted overhead. High above, in the misty blue sky, was a sudden twinkle of fire. He reached up and wiped his sweaty face with a muddy hand and brushed aside a straggly lock of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt to try to look his best. The twinkling fire came"}

II \"A Mr. Macdonald to see you, Mr. Escher.\" Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch. \"Please send him right in.\" That was entirely superfluous, he thought, because MacDonald would come in whether Escher wanted him to or not. The door opened and shut with a slightly harder bang than usual and Escher mentally braced himself. He had a good hunch what the problem was going to be and why it was being thrown in their laps. MacDonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few minutes, just looking grim and not saying anything. Escher knew the psychology by heart. A short preliminary silence is always more effective in browbeating subordinates than an initial furious bluster. He lit a cigarette and tried to outwait MacDonald. It wasn't easy—MacDonald had great staying powers, which was probably why he was the head of the department. Escher gave in first. \"Okay, Mac, what's the trouble? What do we have tossed in our laps now?\" \"You know the one—colonization problem. You know that when we first started to colonize, quite a large percentage of the male population took to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to get away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the men left—but the women didn't. At least, not in nearly the same large numbers. \"Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is now something like five to three. If you don't know what that means, ask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't just a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business and I'm not just using a literary phrase.\" He threw a paper on Escher's desk. \"You'll find most of the statistics about it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's quite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?\" Escher shook his head blankly. \"Most of the girls in the past who didn't catch a husband,\" MacDonald continued, \"grew up to be the type of old maid who's dedicated to improving the morals and what-not of the rest of the population. We've got more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more silly little laws on the"}

We've got more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more silly little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the pokey for things like violating a woman's privacy—whatever that means—and she's the one who decides whether what you say or do is a violation or not.\" Escher looked bored. \"Not to mention the new prohibition which forbids the use of alcohol in everything from cough medicines to hair tonics. Or the cleaned up moral code that reeks—if you'll pardon the expression—of purity. Sure, I know what you mean. And you know the solution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.\" MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair. \"But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your baby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.\" \"Perpetual motion machines are,\" Escher said quietly. \"And pulling yourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should they give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play footsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them alive as not?\" \"What do you advise I do, then?\" MacDonald demanded. \"Go back to the Board and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of anything?\" Escher looked hurt. \"Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.\" \"The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay off. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not necessarily the spirit.\" \"When do they have to have a solution?\" \"As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the situation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will happen then won't be good.\" \"All right, by then we'll have the answer.\" MacDonald stopped at the door. \"There's another reason why they want it worked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is falling off.\" \"How come?\" MacDonald smiled. \"On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to emigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?\" When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly tapped his fingers on the desk-top.

It was lucky that the Colonization Board worked on two levels. One was the well-publicized, idealistic level where nothing was too good and every deal was 99 and 44/100 per cent pure. But when things got too difficult for it to handle on that level, they went to Escher and MacDonald's department. The coal mine level. Nothing was too low, so long as it worked. Of course, if it didn't work, you took the lumps, too. He rummaged around in his drawer and found a list of the qualifications set up by the Board for potential colonists. He read the list slowly and frowned. You had to be physically fit for the rigors of space travel, naturally, but some of the qualifications were obviously silly. You couldn't guarantee physical perfection in the second generation, anyway. He tore the qualification list in shreds and dropped it in the disposal chute. That would have to be the first to go. There were other things that could be done immediately. For one thing, as it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next. He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read it carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no solution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would solve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was still enough. Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't want to colonize. The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second point was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not. No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all—provided you held your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as a moral code. III Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the correspondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to begin. She filed into the washroom with the other girls and carefully redid her face. It was getting hard to disguise the worry lines, to paint away the faint crow's-feet around her eyes. She wasn't, she admitted to herself for the thousandth time, what you would call beautiful. She inspected herself carefully in her compact mirror. In a sudden flash of honesty, she had to admit that she wasn't even what you would call pretty. Her face was too broad, her nose a fraction too long, and her hair was dull.

Her face was too broad, her nose a fraction too long, and her hair was dull. Not homely, exactly—but not pretty, either. Conversation hummed around her, most of it from the little group in the corner, where the extreme few who were married sat as practically a race apart. Their advice was sought, their suggestions avidly followed. \"Going out tonight, Phyl?\" She hesitated a moment, then slowly painted on the rest of her mouth. The question was technically a privacy violator, but she thought she would sidestep it this time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank. \"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want to rinse out.\" The black-haired girl next to her nodded sympathetically. \"Sure, Phyl, I know what you mean. Just like the rest of us—waiting for the phone to ring.\" Phyllis finished washing up and then left the office, carefully noting the girl who was waiting for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard sort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's busty figure. Waiting for a plump, middle-aged man like a stagestruck kid outside a theatre. At home, in her small two-room bachelor-girl apartment, she stripped and took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and toweled herself in front of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You didn't know whether you should keep yourself in trim just on some off-chance, or give up and let yourself go. She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the dishes, and went through the standard routine of getting a book and curling up on the sofa. It was a good book of the boot-legged variety—scientifically written with enough surplus heroes and heroines and lushly described love affairs to hold anybody's interest. It held hers for ten pages and then she threw the book across the room, getting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped and fluttered to the floor. What was the use of kidding herself any longer, of trying to live vicariously and hoping that some day she would have a home and a husband? She was thirty now; the phone hadn't rung in the last three years. She might as well spend this evening as she had spent so many others—call up the girls for a bridge game and a little gossip, though heaven knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping about. Perhaps she should have joined one of the organizations at the office that did something like that seven nights out of every seven. A bridge game or a benefit for some school or a talk on art.

But bridge games and benefits and lectures didn't take the place of a husband and family. She was kidding herself again. She got up and retrieved the battered book, then went over to the mail slot. She hadn't had time to open her mail that morning; most of the time it wasn't worth the effort. Advertisements for book clubs, lecture clubs, how to win at bridge and canasta.... Her fingers sprang the metal tabs on a large envelope and she took out the contents and spread it wide. She gasped. It was a large poster, about a yard square. A man was on it, straddling a tiny city and a small panorama of farms and forests at his feet. He was a handsome specimen, with wavy blond hair and blue eyes and a curly mat on his bare chest that was just enough to be attractive without being apelike. He held an axe in his hands and was eyeing her with a clearly inviting look of brazen self-confidence. It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the authorities immediately! Bright lettering at the top of the poster shrieked: \"Come to the Colonies, the Planets of Romance!\" Whoever had mailed it should be arrested and imprisoned! Preying on.... The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and figures. The need for women out on the colony planets, the percentage of men to women—a startling disproportion—the comfortable cities that weren't nearly as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced qualifications. She caught herself admiring the man on the poster. Naturally, it was an artist's conception, but even so.... And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, where you had to battle disease and dirty savages. It was all a dream. She had never done anything like this and she wouldn't think of doing it now. And had any of her friends seen the poster? Of course, they probably wouldn't tell her even if they had. But the poster was a violation of privacy. Whoever had sent it had taken advantage of information that was none of their business. It was up to her to notify the authorities!"}

She addressed it to the box number in the upper left-hand corner of the plain wrapper that the poster had come in. IV The dress lay on the counter, a small corner of it trailing off the edge. It was a beautiful thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed in gold nylon thread. It was the kind of gown that would make anybody who wore it look beautiful. The price was high, much too high for her to pay. She knew she would never be able to buy it. But she didn't intend to buy it. She looked casually around and noted that nobody was watching her. There was another woman a few counters down and a man, obviously embarrassed, at the lingerie counter. Nobody else was in sight. It was a perfect time. The clerk had left to look up a difficult item that she had purposely asked for and probably wouldn't be back for five minutes. Time enough, at any rate. The dress was lying loose, so she didn't have to pry it off any hangers. She took another quick look around, then hurriedly bundled it up and dropped it in her shopping bag. She had taken two self-assured steps away from the counter when she felt a hand on her shoulder. The grip was firm and muscular and she knew she had lost the game. She also knew that she had to play it out to the end, to grasp any straw. \"Let go of me!\" she ordered in a frostily offended voice. \"Sorry, miss,\" the man said politely, \"but I think we have a short trip to take.\" She thought for a moment of brazening it out further and then gave up. She'd get a few weeks or months in the local detention building, a probing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted her to steal, and then she'd be out again. They couldn't do anything to her that mattered. She shrugged and followed the detective calmly. None of the shoppers had looked up. None seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary. In the detention building she thanked her good luck that she was facing a man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies who served on the bench. She even found a certain satisfaction in the presence of the cigar smoke and the blunt, earthy language that floated in from the corridor. \"Why did you steal it?\" the judge asked. He held up the dress, which, she noted furiously, didn't look nearly as nice as it had under the department store lights. \"I don't have anything to say,\" she said. \"I want to see a lawyer.\" She could imagine what he was thinking. Another tough one, another plain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill. And she probably was. You had to do something nowadays. You couldn't just sit home and chew your fingernails, or run out and listen to the endless boring lectures on art"}

You couldn't just sit home and chew your fingernails, or run out and listen to the endless boring lectures on art and culture. \"Name?\" he asked in a tired voice. She knew the statistics he wanted. \"Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 pounds, brown hair and green eyes. Prints on file.\" The judge leaned down and mentioned something to the bailiff, who left and presently came back with a ledger. The judge opened it and ran his fingers down one of the pages. The sentence would probably be the usual, she thought—six months and a fine, or perhaps a little more when they found out she had a record for shoplifting. A stranger in the courtroom in the official linens of the government suddenly stepped up beside the judge and looked at the page. She could hear a little of what he said: \"... anxiety neurosis ... obvious feeling of not being wanted ... probably steals to attract attention ... recommend emigration.\" \"In view of some complicating factors, we're going to give you a choice,\" the judge finally said. \"You can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a $10,000 fine, or you can ship out to the colony planets and receive a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus.\" She thought for a minute that she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! It was obvious that the state was interested in neither the fine nor in paying her room and board for ten years. She could recognize a squeeze play when she saw it, but there was nothing she could do about it. \"I wouldn't call that a choice,\" she said sourly. \"I'll ship out.\" V Suzanne was proud of the apartment. It had all the modern conveniences, like the needle shower with the perfume dispenser, the built-in soft-drink bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the electrical massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of security in an ever-changing world. She lit a cigarette and chuckled. Mrs. Burger, the fat old landlady, thought she kept up the apartment by working as a buyer for one of the downtown stores. Well, maybe some day she would. But not today. And not tonight. The phone rang and she answered in a casual tone. She talked for a minute, then let a trace of sultriness creep into her voice. The conversation wasn't long. She let the receiver fall back on the base and went into the bedroom to get a hat box. She wouldn't need much; she'd probably be back that same night.

It was a nice night and since the address was only a few blocks away, she decided to walk it. She blithely ignored the curious stares from other pedestrians, attracted by the sharp, clicking sound of her heels on the sidewalk. The address was a brownstone that looked more like an office building than anything else, but then you could never tell. She pressed the buzzer and waited a moment for the sound to echo back and forth on the inside. She pressed it again and a moment later a suave young man appeared in the doorway. \"Miss Carstens?\" She smiled pertly. \"We've been expecting you.\" She wondered a little at the \"we,\" but dutifully smiled and followed him in. The glare of the lights inside the office blinded her for a moment. When she could focus them again, her smile became slightly blurry at the edges and then disappeared entirely. She wasn't alone. There was a battery of chairs against one side of the room. She recognized most of the girls sitting in them. She forced a smile to her lips and tried to laugh. \"I'm sure there's been some mistake! Why, I never....\" The young man coughed politely. \"I'm afraid there's been no mistake. Full name, please.\" \"Suzanne Carstens,\" she said grimly, and gave the other statistics he wanted. She idly wondered what stoolie had peddled the phone numbers. \"Suzanne Carstens,\" the young man noted, and slowly shook his head. \"A very pretty name, but no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't matter, though. Take a seat over there.\" She did as he asked and he faced the entire group. \"I and the other gentlemen here represent the Colonization Board. We've interceded with the local authorities in order to offer you a choice. We would like to ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will pay you the standard emigration bonus of five hundred dollars. The colonists need wives; they offer you—security.\" He stressed the word slightly. \"Now, of course, if you don't prefer the colony planets, you can stay behind and face the penalties of ten years in jail and a fine of ten thousand dollars.\" Suzanne felt that her lower jaw needed support. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! And in either case she'd lose the apartment she had worked so hard for, her symbol of security. \"Well, what do you say?\" There was a dead silence. The young man from the Colonization Board turned to Suzanne. \"How about you, Miss Carstens?\" She smiled sickly and nodded her head. \"I love to travel!\" she said. It didn't sound at all witty even to herself."}

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's History of English Literature , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old books had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue. Not that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the background for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries. On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy paper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read: asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu Dayol fot ig habe mot toseo knwo—te bijk weil en snoll doper—Klio, asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Since when, Quidley wondered, refolding the paper and putting it back in the book, had high-school typing students taken to reading Taine? Thoughtfully he replaced the book on the shelf and moved deeper into the literature section. He had just taken down Xenophon's Anabasis when he saw the girl walk in the door. Let it be said forthwith that old books were not the only item on Herbert Quidley's penchant-list. He liked old wood, too, and old paintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he liked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way Helen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and started building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris wasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job. After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's desk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered his eyes to the Anabasis and henceforth followed her progress out of their corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book and glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the P's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused again and took down Taine's History of English Literature . He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an interest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library were ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the volume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser. Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected another—seemingly at random—and took it over to the librarian's desk. She waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then"}

Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected another—seemingly at random—and took it over to the librarian's desk. She waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked it under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night. As soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took Taine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark was gone. He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was it merely what it appeared to be on the surface—the efforts of an impatient typing student to type before his time? He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that the girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The name rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had contained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got \"Kai\"—or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and had been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream of borrowing. By whom—her boy friend? Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the presence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but because the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word \"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him violently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's History under observation for a while."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Girls_From_Fieu_Dayol_2#0", "contents": "Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend turned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of her own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine, The Zeitgeist , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages and return it to the shelf. After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second message. It was as unintelligible as the first: asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe wotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te. T'lide sid Fieu Dayol po jestig toseo knwo, bijk weil en snoll doper entling—Yoolna. asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Well, perhaps not quite as unintelligible. He knew, at least, who Cai was, and he knew—from the reappearance of the words wotnid , Fieu Dayol and snoll doper —that the two communications were in the same code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last word— Yoolna —was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that she was a different person from the Klio whose name had appended the first message. He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book to the shelf and went back to the reading table and The Zeitgeist . Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning to think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till tomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same tactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by chance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same undetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out the door, he was not far behind her. She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It took him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her. When, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a matter of following her inside. He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead before, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple. First you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you situated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the nearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and after the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till he/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar. When she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a way that some of its contents spilled on her lap— \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it"}

{"chunk_id": "The_Girls_From_Fieu_Dayol_3#0", "contents": "\"It's all right, it's only sugar,\" she said, laughing. \"I'm hopelessly clumsy,\" he continued smoothly, brushing the gleaming crystals from her pleated skirt, noting the clean sweep of her thighs. \"I beseech you to forgive me.\" \"You're forgiven,\" she said, and he noticed then that she spoke with a slight accent. \"If you like, you can send it to the cleaners and have them send the bill to me. My address is 61 Park Place.\" He pulled out his wallet, chose an appropriate card, and handed it to her— Herbert Quidley: Profiliste Her forehead crinkled. \" Profiliste? \" \"I paint profiles with words,\" he said. \"You may have run across some of my pieces in the Better Magazines. I employ a variety of pseudonyms, of course.\" \"How interesting.\" She pronounced it \"anteresting.\" \"Not famous profiles, you understand. Just profiles that strike my fancy.\" He paused. She had raised her cup to her lips and was taking a dainty sip. \"You have a rather striking profile yourself, Miss—\" \"Smith. Kay Smith.\" She set the cup back on the counter and turned and faced him. For a second her eyes seemed to expand till they preoccupied his entire vision, till he could see nothing but their disturbingly clear—and suddenly cold—blueness. Panic touched him, then vanished when she said, \"Would you really consider word-painting my profile, Mr. Quidley?\" Would he! \"When can I call?\" She hesitated for a moment. Then: \"I think it will be better if I call on you. There are quite a number of people living in our—our house. I'm afraid the quarters would be much too cramped for an artist like yourself to concentrate.\" Quidley glowed. Usually it required two or three days, and sometimes a week, to reach the apartment phase. \"Fine,\" he said. \"When can I expect you?\" She stood up and he got to his feet beside her. She was even taller than he had thought. In fact, if he hadn't been wearing Cuban heels, she'd have been taller than he was. \"I'll be in town night after next,\" she said. \"Will nine o'clock be convenient for you?\" \"Perfectly.\" \"Good-by for now then, Mr. Quidley.\" He was so elated that when he arrived at his apartment he actually did try to write a profile. His own, of course. He sat down at his custom-built chrome-trimmed desk, inserted a blank sheet of paper in his custom-built typewriter and tried to arrange his thoughts. But as usual his mind raced ahead of the moment, and he saw the title, Self Profile , nestling noticeably on the contents page of one of the Better Magazines, and presently he saw the piece itself in all its splendid array of colorful rhetoric, sparkling imagery and scintillating wit, occupying a two-page spread. It was some time before he returned to reality, and when he did the first thing that met his eyes was the uncompromisingly blank sheet of paper.

The following evening, however, after readying his apartment for the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table post and took up The Zeitgeist once again. He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman. And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and graceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy section now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the literature aisle and toward the T's.... The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough: fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind en snoll doper nckli! Wotnid antwaterer Fieu Dayol hid jestig snoll doper ifedererer te. Dep gogensplo snoll dopers ensing!—Gorka. fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Judging from the repeated use of the words, snoll dopers were the topic of the day. Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the book back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay. He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what a snoll doper was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur secret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged. It virtually had to be an amateur secret society. Unless, of course, they were foreigners. But what on earth foreign organization would be quixotic enough to employ Taine's History of English Literature as a communications medium when there was a telephone in every drugstore and a mailbox on every corner? Somehow the words \"what on earth foreign organization\" got turned around in his mind and became \"what foreign organization on earth\" and before he could summon his common sense to succor him, he experienced a rather bad moment. By the time the door chimes sounded he was his normal self again. He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his shirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and looked around the room to see if everything was in place. Everything was—the typewriter uncovered and centered on the chrome-trimmed desk, with the sheaf of crinkly first-sheets beside it; the reference books stacked imposingly nearby; Harper's , The Atlantic and The Saturday Review showing conspicuously in the magazine rack; the newly opened bottle of bourbon and the two snifter glasses on the sideboard; the small table set cozily for two—"}

When he saw what she was wearing he had to tilt his head back so that his eyes wouldn't fall out of their sockets. Skin, mostly, in the upper regions. White, glowing skin on which her long hair lay like forest pools. As for her dress, it was as though she had fallen forward into immaculate snow, half-burying her breasts before catching herself on her elbows, then turning into a sitting position, the snow clinging to her skin in a glistening veneer; arising finally to her feet, resplendently attired. He went over to the sideboard, picked up the bottle of bourbon. She followed. He set the two snifter glasses side by side and tilted the bottle. \"Say when.\" \"When!\" \"I admire your dress—never saw anything quite like it.\" \"Thank you. The material is something new. Feel it.\" \"It's—it's almost like foam rubber. Cigarette?\" \"Thanks.... Is something wrong, Mr. Quidley?\" \"No, of course not. Why?\" \"Your hands are trembling.\" \"Oh. I'm—I'm afraid it's the present company, Miss Smith.\" \"Call me Kay.\" They touched glasses: \"Your liquor is as exquisite as your living room, Herbert. I shall have to come here more often.\" \"I hope you will, Kay.\" \"Though such conduct, I'm told, is morally reprehensible on the planet Earth.\" \"Not in this particular circle. Your hair is lovely.\" \"Thank you.... You haven't mentioned my perfume yet. Perhaps I'm standing too far away.... There!\" \"It's—it's as lovely as your hair, Kay.\" \"Um, kiss me again.\" \"I—I never figured—I mean, I engaged a caterer to serve us dinner at 9:30.\" \"Call him up. Make it 10:30.\""}

He could hardly wait till the next message transfer took place. He decided to spend the evening plotting the epic novel which he intended to write someday. He set to work immediately. He plotted mentally, of course—notes were for the hacks and the other commercial non-geniuses who infested the modern literary world. Closing his eyes, he saw the whole vivid panorama of epic action and grand adventure flowing like a mighty and majestic river before his literary vision: the authentic and awe-inspiring background; the hordes of colorful characters; the handsome virile hero, the compelling Helenesque heroine.... God, it was going to be great! The best thing he'd ever done! See, already there was a crowd of book lovers in front of the bookstore, staring into the window where the new Herbert Quidley was on display, trying to force its way into the jammed interior.... Cut to interior. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell me quickly, are there any more copies of the new Herbert Quidley left? BOOK CLERK: A few. You don't know how lucky you are to get here before the first printing ran out. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Give me a dozen.

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle and staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay doing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her correspondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl scouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges in communications! You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though. Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the snoll-doper enigma. The fact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a snoll doper , for all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an H-bomb. He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak English if her own language ran something like \" ist ifedereret, hid jestig snoll doper adwo ?\" He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar. He remembered the material of her dress. He remembered how she had come to his room. \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\""}

She appropriated the message, read it. \"Put the book back,\" she said presently. Then, when he complied: \"Come on.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"I'm going to deliver a snoll doper to Jilka. After that I'm going to take you home to meet my folks.\" The relieved sigh he heard was his own. They climbed into her convertible and she nosed it into the moving line of cars. \"How long have you been reading my mail?\" she asked. \"Since the night before I met you.\" \"Was that the reason you spilled the sugar?\" \"Part of the reason,\" he said. \"What's a snoll doper ?\" She laughed. \"I don't think I'd better tell you just yet.\" He sighed again. \"But if Jilka wanted a snoll doper ,\" he said after a while, \"why in the world didn't she call you up and say so?\" \"Regulations.\" She pulled over to the curb in front of a brick apartment building. \"This is where Jilka lives. I'll explain when I get back.\" He watched her get out, walk up the walk to the entrance and let herself in. He leaned his head back on the seat, lit a cigarette and exhaled a mixture of smoke and relief. On the way to meet her folks. So it was just an ordinary secret society after all. And here he'd been thinking that she was the key figure in a Martian plot to blow up Earth— Her folks ! Abruptly the full implication of the words got through to him, and he sat bolt-up-right on the seat. He was starting to climb out of the car when he saw Kay coming down the walk. Anyway, running away wouldn't solve his problem. A complete disappearing act was in order, and a complete disappearing act would take time. Meanwhile he would play along with her."}

Lights danced in the darkness behind them as another car jounced down the rutted road. \"Jilka,\" Kay said. \"I wonder if she got him.\" Apparently she had. At least there was a man with her—a rather woebegone, wilted creature who didn't even look up as they passed. Quidley watched them ascend the gangplank, the man in the lead, and disappear into the ship. \"Next,\" Kay said. Quidley shook his head. \"You're not taking me to another planet!\" She opened her purse and pulled out a small metallic object \"A little while ago you asked me what a snoll doper was,\" she said. \"Unfortunately interstellar law severely limits us in our choice of marriageable males, and we can take only those who refuse to conform to the sexual mores of their own societies.\" She did something to the object that caused it to extend itself into a long, tubular affair. \" This is a snoll doper .\" She prodded his ribs. \"March,\" she said. He marched. Halfway up the plank he glanced back over his shoulder for a better look at the object pressed against his back. It bore a striking resemblance to a shotgun."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could he—and how could anyone find out what those terms might be? The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the old, orange sun. It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold, fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either. As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then, at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that. A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright. Then all was quiet—outside. Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the air. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing practically whipped, too!\""}

Fred, once called Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had begun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_3#0", "contents": "Junior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable of exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult reflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his knees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it, Fred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter less than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as Earth.\" Grampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from the navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh, Junior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data into Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that the second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said, 'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium—'\" \"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\" Those were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking remarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled until Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened. \"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.' It sounds disrespectful.\" Reba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a red-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That Junior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever noticed about the boy. \"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred is Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\" \"That's different,\" Reba said. Grampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The pircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender openings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing made me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\" \"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother and Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but somehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure he did the best he could.\" \"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting, \"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing, Junior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the curving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred years ago.\" \"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work to do.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_4#0", "contents": "Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last button on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to do, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\" \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth share.\" \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money bought it?\" \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said. \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space flivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\" \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said. \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the rest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\" \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and longevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to go searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly galaxy? You, Grampa!\" \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be sorry when I'm dead and gone.\" \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just before we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\" \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that? Well, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a button. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\" Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the computer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from Earth, didn't you? What's the game?\" Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense concentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit, taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player who makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\" \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is to—\" \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask for it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted indignantly."}

Four angled the picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the flivver's stern. \"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora—it has fauna.\" He rushed to the air lock. \"Four!\" Reba called out warningly. \"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms viable within the Terran spectrum.\" \"What about macro-organisms—\" Reba began, but the boy was gone already. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior. \"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\" But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him, he asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\" \"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer quit.\" \"Quit!\" \"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver—it won't budge!\""}

It opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep? Fweep?\" Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her face. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_7#0", "contents": "\"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment. \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand impatiently. \"Get it out!\" Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\" \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with aliens. And that's nothing but a—a blob!\" \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\" \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\" Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes me sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly at Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me—well!\" She swept grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that opened out from it. \"Fweep?\" asked the blob. \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep—I mean sweep.\" Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a narrow path of sparkling clean tile. Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\" he said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never had the nerve.\" \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised. \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\" \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior would have had competition!\" \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever married a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\" Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you and to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_8#0", "contents": "Grampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring intently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\" \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said absently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then slowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\" \"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building me a pircuit?\" \"You get the other one figured out?\" \"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the principle. The player who moved second could always win if he used the right strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of four each—\" \"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing the other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\" Grampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it. Inside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible free-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\" he said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he lifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he sighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put the bottle away. \"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked. \"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit—\" \"Did you ever work on Niccolò Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely brides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger rowboat?\" \"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\" Four thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three missionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one of the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries—\" \"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\" \"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had paused at Grampa's feet. Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared into Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path seemed crooked. Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_9#0", "contents": "As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously toward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the polarizer turned on.\" The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred, followed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary, scintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts. \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly. \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled. \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at once. Joyce!\" The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was regal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question: \"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\" \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a few low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\" \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked. Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is as good as anybody's.\" \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained. She turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy rich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like billionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this cramped old flivver—and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She glared venomously at Grampa. \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly. \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated. \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As real estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\" \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the end of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our lives right here—involuntary colonists.\" Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched. \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either it's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that just won't polarize.\" \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were any good.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_10#0", "contents": "The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either. Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father. All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it.\" \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\" \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested. Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And, anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\" \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why? Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\" Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept without question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth—\" \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa, what's the theory behind polarization?\" Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the jeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know how light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_11#0", "contents": "He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light the vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When light is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or refraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are still perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles or ellipses.\" The faces were still blank and unillumined. \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of matter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle around itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of spaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity into a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue accelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\" The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no longer. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius. He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer. He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\" \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe I didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the scientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the blamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near as I remember. Now me—I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else worry over 'why.'\" \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped. \"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool perpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any moron would know they were impossible.\" Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity polarizer before I invented it.\" \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted. \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with some coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling, dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out near the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound it.\" \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded ironically. \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_12#0", "contents": "\"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can do is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call—\" \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\" \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world. Earth gravity. The flivver—even if the polarizer won't work, there's the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we want.\" \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly. \"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not me.\" Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it happened.\" \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said. \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered. \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\" \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room, carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round, raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep. \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully. \"Not now,\" said Four. \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\" \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate its center of gravity.\" \"Well?\" Fred prompted. \"It shifts.\" \"That's impossible,\" said Junior. \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied. \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked. \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following me.\" \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly. \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly. \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet so heavy. He's why we can't leave.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_13#0", "contents": "The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out, Four,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and—\" \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making the grand tour of the cabin. The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them, absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too. \"Rat poison?\" Four asked. Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\" \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\" \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know. \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\" Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped. Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\" \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\" \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said unbelievingly. Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his—whatever it is he uses for skin—is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several feet of lead.\" Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\" \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it might be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the thought."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_14#0", "contents": "Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do something with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here at the whim of a mere blob!\" \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what he's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends the space-time continuum around him—conscious or subconscious, I don't know. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the flivver won't move.\" \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it stopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off, we'll just have to do away with it.\" \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and you can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so you can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats' everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him. Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower his radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times. Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\" \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around and wait for that thing to die?\" \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his kind on this planet.\" \"Well?\" \"Probably he's immortal.\" \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically. \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction. Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal creatures.\" \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or something. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\" \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger than when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\" Fred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its water, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Gravity_Business_15#0", "contents": "Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that, anyway.\" \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go immediately !\" Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand! And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making him do it!\" Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high, shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room. Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to Fred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\" Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce. \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called. Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like some reedy folk music. \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly. \"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\" \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the polarizer worked for a little while when we landed—long enough to keep us from being squashed—and then quit.\" \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or where it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's when we dropped.\""}

After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\" \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway, excitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\" Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised—\" \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to it, I mean?\" \"Some,\" Four admitted. \"Have you asked it to let us go?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well? What did it say?\" \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\" At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips. \"Fwiend,\" it said. \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\" In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite a sacrifice to ask, but—\" \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him—\" \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\" \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently."}

And if it did work, it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug—\" \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more. Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr. It's out of the question.

Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior, I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you got the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\" Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his hand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer can work on.\" \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with this problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's a simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about the cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because Fweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work because he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line, and he don't want Four to leave him. \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't understand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's got Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor to Four, he'd let us leave—if we'd leave Four here with him, which we ain't gonna do. \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use making a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer with the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've already solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus, you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal points.\" \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why this computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's Four? He's the only one who understands this thing.\" \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice soft. \"No, here they come now.\""}

DICK ILLUSTRATED BY SMITH [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Science Fiction Adventures Magazine December 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was wrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw it hanging in the town square. Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and wheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself! It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost. From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square. Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands. It was a body. A human body."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HANGING_STRANGER_2#0", "contents": "\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\" Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.\" \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the sky—the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is. How the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\" Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\" \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\" Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\" Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\" \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to call the cops.\" \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be there.\" \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business before pleasure.\" Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!\" \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\" \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\" \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run. See you later, Ed.\" Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle—and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention. \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green. The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue. \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsion—and fear. Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean? And—why didn't anybody notice? He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the man grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\" Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\" \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look sick.\" \"The body. There in the park.\" \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. \"Take it easy.\" Margaret Henderson from"}

Don't you see it? For God's sake—\" \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously. \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\" More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\" \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\" \"Ed—\" \"Better get a doctor!\" \"He must be sick.\" \"Or drunk.\" Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him. \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\" The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HANGING_STRANGER_3#0", "contents": "\"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured. \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back there—\" \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath. \"1368 Hurst Road.\" \"That's here in Pikeville?\" \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost—\" \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded. \"Where?\" Loyce echoed. \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\" \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\" \"In the basement ?\" \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do with—\" \"Was anybody else down there with you?\" \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope. \"You mean because I was down there I missed—the explanation? I didn't get in on it? Like everybody else?\" After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed the explanation.\" \"Then it's official? The body—it's supposed to be hanging there?\" \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\" Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking over.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\" \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights had not yet come on. \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there?\" The two cops said nothing. \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of—\" \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short process. Only a few minutes.\" \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that and—\" Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts, people running. They weren't cops. He had realized that right away.

Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts, people running. They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops. They weren't cops—and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't know—and they didn't care. That was the strange part. Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting. There was no sound behind him. He had got away. He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars. And to his right—the police station. He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them. Them? Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance. And—something else. Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky. He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees. Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over the City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex something moved. Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof. Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing—them."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_HANGING_STRANGER_4#0", "contents": "For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water. They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the City Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest—and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building. He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on. Were there more of them? It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien—from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being. On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others. Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them. Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry. Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them. He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom. Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HANGING_STRANGER_5#0", "contents": "Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family. Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white angora sweater. Gazing absently ahead of her. A high school boy in jeans and black jacket. A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families. To dinner. Going home—with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their town, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof. Maybe there were others. Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently their power-zone was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his chain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache. Well-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly away. Loyce tensed. One of them ? Or—another they had missed? The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them—or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond. The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce. The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second something passed between them. A look rich with meaning. Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open. \"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hell—\" Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately,"}

Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off. Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book. Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. \" Stop! For God's sake listen—\" He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him. Had he made a mistake? But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out—away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his."}

What—\" Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. \"Pull down the shades. Quick.\" Janet moved toward the window. \"But—\" \"Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?\" \"Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?\" Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room. \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me.\" \"Escaped?\" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. \"Who?\" \"The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it pretty well figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police department. What they did with the real humans they—\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"We've been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension. They're insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind.\" \"My mind?\" \"Their entrance is here , in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you. The whole town—except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited! They can make mistakes!\" Janet shook her head. \"I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane.\" \"Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement I'd be like all the rest of you.\" Loyce peered out the window. \"But I can't stand here talking. Get your coat.\" \"My coat?\" \"We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close—but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!\" He grabbed her arm roughly. \"Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving. Don't stop to pack. There's no time for that.\" White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat. \"Where are we going?\" Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They'll have the highway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it.\" \"The old Ranch Road? Good Lord—it's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it.\" \"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That's our best chance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of gas, isn't it?\" Janet was dazed. \"The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon.\" Janet moved toward the stairs. \"Ed, I—\" \"Call the twins!\" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life.

We're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done—\" \"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where's Jim?\" \"He's coming.\" Jim started slowly down the stairs. \"What's up, Dad?\" \"We're going for a ride.\" \"A ride? Where?\" Ed turned to Janet. \"We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn it on.\" He pushed her toward the set. \"So they'll think we're still—\" He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse—the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing? A stinger. Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down. Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence, settling over him—and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug. It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of some kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy.... He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still, neither of them moving. The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone. Loyce opened the door.

His clothing was torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled. Ten miles—on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted. But ahead of him lay Oak Grove. He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from Pikeville. A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string. The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. \"Thank God.\" He caught hold of the wall. \"I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me.\" \"What happened?\" the attendant demanded. \"You in a wreck? A hold-up?\" Loyce shook his head wearily. \"They have the whole town. The City Hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the first thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up.\" The attendant licked his lip nervously. \"You're out of your head. I better get a doctor.\" \"Get me into Oak Grove,\" Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel. \"We've got to get started—cleaning them out. Got to get started right away.\""}

Loyce pushed it impatiently away. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\" he said abruptly. Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\" \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\" Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a theory,\" he murmured. \"What is it?\" \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time.

The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gains—but finally they're defeated.\" \"Why defeated?\" \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\" The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He turned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out.\" \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?\" \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \" Bait. \" Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\" \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control—and who had escaped.\" Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they expected failures! They anticipated—\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\" \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\" Loyce started slowly to"}

Come along with me, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole—and a rope! \"Right this way,\" the Commissioner said, smiling coldly."}

Only a few people were there, hurrying home to dinner. \"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him. \"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tier. He was glad to be finished. At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around—and froze. From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large and shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it? Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous and ugly. The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew him on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened—and fascinated. And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it."}

But to face the horrors of such a planet as this was too much. Imagine Fawkes' terrible predicament; plenty of food—and twenty seven beautiful girls for companions. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Jonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girl was bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the girl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The sky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his bunk aboard the space ship. \"You're not dead?\" \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to his elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was pert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals. \"Is—is anything broken?\" she asked. \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his feet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot with Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a concrete mixer.\" She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away. Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It had burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had survived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to Jupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\" \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the wreckage.\" He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He had an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the trouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on her course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling into my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He paused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have been a cinder by this time,\" he said. The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished that pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I? I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\" The girl shrugged her shoulders. \"I don't know.\" \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his surprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across the plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward higher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain of mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated cone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just he and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast"}

As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated cone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just he and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast rolling prairie. \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an asteroid.\" \"We?\" he looked back at her. \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too, only we were going to be wives for the colonists.\" \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers Association enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\" She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\" \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said. \"We hit this asteroid.\" \"But that was three years ago.\" \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her eyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self conscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw your space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a heap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear. \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about four miles,\" she said. \"I think so,\" he said."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_2#0", "contents": "Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space ship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They were the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he realized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown of concentration marred her regular features. He turned around. On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward them. She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her stomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared after her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice. He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like he was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled after the girl. \"What's wrong?\" The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I didn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which leads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach the hills we'll be safe.\" \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\" \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was wrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head foremost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom, winced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the hills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her. \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted. \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could get around in the hills.\" The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a gorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon of sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the crevices and floor of the canyon. They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped away, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her arm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied it to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded him. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year 3372; not the time of ancient Greece. The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more precipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the uniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking. \"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette package, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground. \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope. The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we were here.\" Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship. \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm. He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the freighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\""}

He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the freighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\" \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her grip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said. \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship. I don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley tobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on Ganymede.\" \"No!\" He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly detached her hand. The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it. \"We are going to the camp,\" she said. Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from under her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away. A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_3#0", "contents": "He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward them from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was barefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around her sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her brown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table cloth at one time in its history. \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a man!\" \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann. \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\" A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off warily. Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\" Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way he had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the canyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the bend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him. Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer weight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up bodily, started up the canyon chanting: \" He was a rocket riding daddy from Mars. \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago. Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the spaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had been broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of his left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy, tough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from mortification. He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\" \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann. \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being held aloft by four barbarous young women. \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a break.\" Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between two husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease with which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light weight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the plains. He wished he was a centaur. The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan picked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised one of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\" \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow ledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from under him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment he thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, hauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a rope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way"}

He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a rope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top like a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it. The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking the prairie. \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge. A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first, Jonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up they resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to his own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses. \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_4#0", "contents": "The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who reared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they hurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly like the neighing of horses. Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem of the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred to him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's moon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to the lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty times as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke. At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults back and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls resumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes. The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots. \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome fellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed. They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep valley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees along its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of the valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner. They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind a promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming ordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew the girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp like a bag of meal. The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner reappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded and rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded him of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He looked away hastily. Someone hailed them from the space ship. \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors. A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship. \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She had green eyes. \"We're rescued!\" \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\" \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus. \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\" \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could look so good?\" \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered like an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt like a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats. A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said, \"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of the voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus.

It reminded him of the voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him appraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him into the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\" He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the wrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of the floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His feet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the Thirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past. With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang forward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be seated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like a captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar settings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan Fawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild women."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_5#0", "contents": "As the meal boisterously progressed, he regained sufficient courage to glance timidly around. Directly across the table sat a striking, grey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She looked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized a whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers, gnawed a leg. She caught him staring at her and rolled her eyes at him. He returned his gaze to his plate. Olga said: \"Hey, Sultan.\" He shuddered, but looked up questioningly. She said, \"How's the fish?\" \"Good,\" he mumbled between a mouthful. \"Where did you get it?\" \"Caught it,\" said Olga. \"The stream's full of 'em. I'll take you fishing tomorrow.\" She winked at him so brazenly that he choked on a bone. \"Heaven forbid,\" he said. \"How about coming with me to gather fruit?\" cried the green-eyed blonde; \"you great big handsome man.\" \"Or me?\" cried another. And the table was in an uproar. The rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table until the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was called Billy. \"Quiet!\" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. \"Let him be. He can't go anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs rest.\" She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. \"How about some roast?\" she said. \"No.\" He pushed back his plate with a sigh. \"If I only had a smoke.\" Olga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. \"Isn't that just like a man?\" \"I wouldn't know,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"I've forgotten what they're like.\" Billy said, \"How badly wrecked is your ship?\" \"It's strewn all over the landscape,\" he replied sleepily. \"Is there any chance of patching it up?\" He considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he wanted to sleep. \"What?\" he said. \"Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?\" repeated Billy. \"Not outside the space docks.\" They expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax the barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The movement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering lassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes. \"You look exhausted,\" said Ann. Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. \"Just tired,\" he mumbled. \"Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.\" Indeed it was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His eyelids drooped lower and lower. \"First it's tobacco,\" said Olga; \"now he wants to sleep. Twenty-seven girls and he wants to sleep.\" \"He is asleep,\" said the green-eyed blonde."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_6#0", "contents": "Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his arms. \"Catch a hold,\" said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girls volunteered with a rush. \"Hoist!\" said Billy. They lifted him like a sleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom, where they deposited him on the bed. Ann said to Olga; \"Help me with these boots.\" But they resisted every tug. \"It's no use,\" groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright yellow hair back from her eyes. \"His feet have swollen. We'll have to cut them off.\" At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope. \" Cut off whose feet? \" he cried in alarm. \"Not your feet, silly,\" said Ann. \"Your boots.\" \"Lay a hand on those boots,\" he scowled; \"and I'll make me another pair out of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.\" Having delivered himself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep. Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. \"And this,\" she cried \"is what we've been praying for during the last three years.\" The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a cane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced all around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he presumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits and berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He walked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be hanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped. He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by twenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it off in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the shade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be years before they were rescued. As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join the centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains on the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was ambling toward him. \"How's the invalid?\" she said, seating herself beside him. \"Hot, isn't it?\" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the flat of her hand on his chest and shoved. \" Ooof! \" he grunted. He sat down rather more forcibly than he had risen. \"Don't get up because of me,\" she informed him. \"It's my turn to cook, but I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do you know that you are irresistible?\" She seized his shoulders, stared into his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a hungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow with his sleeve. \"Suppose the rest should come,\" he said in an embarrassed voice. \"They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your eyes,\""}

She said, \"You're the best looking thing.\" She rumpled his hair. \"I can't keep my eyes off you.\" Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. \"Ouch!\" He winced. He had forgotten his sore muscles. \"I forgot,\" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise. \"You're hurt.\" He pulled her back down. \"Not so you could notice it,\" he grinned. \"Well!\" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. \"We're all glad to hear that!\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Happy_Castaway_7#0", "contents": "Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked around. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their features were grim. He said: \"I don't feel so well after all.\" \"It don't wash,\" said Billy. \"It's time for a showdown.\" Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take her stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a menacing angle. She said in an angry voice: \"He's mine. I found him. Leave him alone.\" \"Where do you get that stuff?\" cried Olga. \"Share and share alike, say I.\" \"We could draw straws for him,\" suggested the green-eyed blonde. \"Look here,\" Jonathan broke in. \"I've got some say in the matter.\" \"You have not,\" snapped Billy. \"You'll do just as we say.\" She took a step toward him. Jonathan edged away in consternation. \"He's going to run!\" Olga shouted. Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the plain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing relaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes at the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace. At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs, he scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space ship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and tore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the wreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription in silver letters: \"INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.\" Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in surprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray Rifle in his hand. \"I'm Jonathan Fawkes,\" said the castaway as he panted up, \"pilot for Universal. I was wrecked.\" A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed mustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a yellow composition holder. He said, \"I'm Doctor Boynton.\" He had a rich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. \"We are members of the Interstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a cursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr. Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning when we sighted the wreck.\" \"I say,\" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim, energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun gingerly, respectfully. \"We're a week overdue now,\" he said. \"If you have any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd best be getting them aboard.\""}

He said, \"Do any of you know how to grow tobacco?\" They glanced at each other in perplexity. \"I like it here,\" continued Jonathan. \"I'm not going back.\" \"What?\" cried the three explorers in one breath. \"I'm going to stay,\" he repeated. \"I only came back here after the cigarettes.\" \"But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back in the space lanes,\" said Doctor Boynton. \"You don't possibly expect to be picked up before then!\" Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco seed, and cigarettes. \"Odd.\" Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. \"Though if I remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during the medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the wilderness to escape the temptation of women .\" Jonathan laughed outright. \"You are sure you won't return, young man?\" He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant. He said, \"You might report my accident to Universal.

There isn’t anything that Judy can’t solve.” Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe she’d understand—understand any better than I do. Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no exception.” “You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t solve.” “Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—” “Judy Dobbs, remember?” “Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved all those mysteries. I met you when the whole valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened by flood and you solved that—” “That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace, not me. He was the hero without even meaning to be. He was the one who rode through town and warned people that the flood was coming. I was off chasing a shadow.” “A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh. “What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.” “It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed. “I know now that keeping that promise not to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.” “Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.” “Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk about?” “You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or two before the flood, but what about the haunted house you moved into? You were the one who tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.” “Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back, “there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but what she was or how she spoke to me is more than I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling. And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them. They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re stored in one end of the attic.” “Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and show up the spooks?” “I didn’t say the attic was haunted.” Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it.

How thrilling!” exclaimed Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and show up the spooks?” “I didn’t say the attic was haunted.” Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries, but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally told them, the summer before they met. Horace had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow. Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she confessed now as she reviewed everything that had happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact that her parents left her every summer while they went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they think she would do? “You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery series you like. When they’re finished there are plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how you love to read.” “I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—” Judy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t glad to have her. “You here again?” she had greeted her that summer, and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with yourself this time?” “Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say you have a whole stack of old magazines—” “In the attic. Go up and look them over if you can stand the heat.” Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so much as to escape to a place where she could have a good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth birthday. In another year she would have outgrown her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or be grown up enough to ask them to"}

Go up and look them over if you can stand the heat.” Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so much as to escape to a place where she could have a good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth birthday. In another year she would have outgrown her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a vacation of her own. In another year she would be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost Parade . “A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling her, “and you solved everything.” But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen on a picture of a fountain. “A fountain with tears for water. How strange!” she remembered saying aloud. Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a fountain still caught and held rainbows like those she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls. But all that was in the future. If anyone had told the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in their faces. “That tease!” For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so are you!” Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him. The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing, she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried. “But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—” A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion, “Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people know your wishes instead of muttering them to yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.” “Were they?” asked Lois. She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what Judy was telling them without interruption. “That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied. “There weren’t any of them impossible.” And she went on to tell them how, the very next day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain exactly like the one in the picture.

It was in the center of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it. Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy had stared at them a moment and then climbed the steps to the pool. “Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud. “Is this beautiful fountain real?” A voice had answered, although she could see no one. “Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely come true.” “A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.” “Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will surely come true,” the voice had repeated. “But what is there to cry about?” “You found plenty to cry about back at your grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up there in the attic?” “Then you—you are the fountain!” Judy remembered exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It doesn’t have a voice.” “Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had said in a mysterious whisper."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Haunted_Fountain_3#0", "contents": "id=\"chap02\"> CHAPTER II If Wishes Came True “Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly. “Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any longer. What did you wish?” “Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming to that.” First, she told her friends, she had to think of a wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved away. “You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister, and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before they vanished, and so I began naming the things I wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton, and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to think of others that my wishes started to come true.” “But what were they?” Lois insisted. Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful. Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything more.” “Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois asked. “Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep pets, and have a nice home, and—” “And your wishes all came true!” “Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That seemed impossible at the time, but the future did hold a sister for me.” “It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?” “Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.” “Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was enchanted?” Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so at the time. I wandered around, growing very drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain had been a dream.” “A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure"}

I must have gone to sleep, because I remember waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain had been a dream.” “A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it wasn’t a flying carpet?” “No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick with roses. Did I tell you it was June?” “All the year around?” Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly, “Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long way from June to December.” “Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too, and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens. I explored the garden all around the fountain.” “And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her. “Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t you try to solve the mystery?” “I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if I had been older or more experienced. I really should have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine was your friend.” “I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered. “It was all because of my foolish jealousy.” “It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that things started happening so fast that I completely forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t believe I thought about it again until after we moved to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and saw the fountain on your lawn.” “The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,” Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.” “You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll show you.” Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while Judy was telling them the story of the fountain. Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had tasted it too often while she was making it. “I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided. Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously with cream. “Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including lettuce. Do you mind"}

He eats everything we eat, including lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine? He wants to explore the attic, too.” “He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle. Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was removed. But there was still a door closing off the narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it. “He can read my mind. He always knows where I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling noise came from the floor above. “Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid of,” Judy urged her friends. “Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,” confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing room at the top of the last flight of stairs. “So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious about black cats, but they are creepy. Does Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?” “Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy. Pausing at still another door that led to the darker part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously, “Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody care to explore the past?” The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy relating still more of what she remembered about the fountain. “When I told Grandma about it she laughed and said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those you see on that high shelf by the window. I think she and Grandpa like the way they lived without any modern conveniences or anything.” “I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died the same winter, isn’t it?” “Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they wished neither of them would outlive the other. If they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes. Another could have been to keep the good old days, as Grandma used to call them. That one came true in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the past when they kept all these old things."}

That one came true in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the past when they kept all these old things. That’s what I meant about turning back the clock.” “If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things were the way they used to be when I trusted Arthur—” “Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked. Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed monster coming between her and her handsome husband, Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It is. It’s the very same one.” “But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!” Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?” “I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home. But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way. If she did, she pretended not to. “Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love to, wouldn’t you, Judy?” “I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically. “Do you recognize it, too?” “I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little more closely the picture they had found. “It looks like the fountain on the Brandt estate.” “The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned. “Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny all the way to Farringdon.” “Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.” “Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them. “I never thought it led to a house, though. There isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents took?” “Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?” Lois suggested."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Haunted_Fountain_4#0", "contents": "id=\"chap03\"> CHAPTER III A Strange Encounter Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to it under one condition. They were not to drive all the way to the house which, she said, was just over the hilltop. They were to park the car where no one would see it and follow the path to the fountain. “But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy. “You’ll remember it, won’t you?” Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure. She and Lois both argued that it would be better to inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly. “She’d be glad to show us around. This way it looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they started off in the blue car she was driving. It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed and said if they did find the fountain she thought she’d wish for one exactly like it. “Well, you know what your grandmother said about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you let people know about them instead of muttering them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.” “Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur coat he gave me last year.” “Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow. The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they had covered the distance that had seemed such a long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s wagon. “I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t explain what happened afterwards. When I woke up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse, wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.” “How could they?” asked Lois. “Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to see how beautiful everything was before—” Again she broke off as if there were something she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare. “Before what?” questioned Judy. “Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You were telling us how you woke up in the hammock, but you never did explain how you got back home,” Lorraine reminded her. “Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it, but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember driving home along this road. You see, I thought my grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise and would return for me. I told you"}

I do remember driving home along this road. You see, I thought my grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise and would return for me. I told you I was all alone. There wasn’t a house in sight.” “The Brandt house is just over the top of this next hill,” Lois put in. “I know. You told me that. Now I know why I couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally, I followed it. There’s something about a path in the woods that always tempts me.” “We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.” “Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where the hammock was and then through an archway,” Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes peered out at me from unexpected places. I was actually scared by the time I reached the old tower. There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he was driving off without me.” “He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise, and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like that?” “I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered. “The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.” “I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate. “Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s another car coming.” As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind Judy until the car had passed. The man driving it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered most of his hair. “What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for playing hide and seek?” “I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there any more.” “Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do, can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly. She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew more about the Brandt estate than she was telling. Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond. The sky was gray with white clouds being driven across it"}

Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond. The sky was gray with white clouds being driven across it by the wind. “There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can see it over to the left. It looks like something out of Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?” “It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder what it is.” “I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But if there are new people living here they’ll never give us permission.” “We might explore it without permission,” Judy suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for the fountain.” “Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It won’t be enchanted. I told you—” “You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If you know anything about the people who live here now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise, I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.” “I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember Roger Banning from school, don’t you? I’ve seen him around here. His family must have acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on the estate.” “Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places together.” “It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively. “I was just out for a drive.” “You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better than that. I did know him slightly, but not from school. The boys and girls were separated and went to different high schools by the time we moved to Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a lot better. He was in our young people’s group at church.” “Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.” “For what?” asked Judy. Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts to gossip. “Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important business people. I think he forged some legal documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary. It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her. Now Judy did remember. It was something she would have preferred to forget. She liked to think she was a good judge of character, and she had taken Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would never stoop to crime."}

She liked to think she was a good judge of character, and she had taken Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would never stoop to crime. “I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,” Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look for it, or aren’t we?” “Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I just like to know what a tiger looks like before he springs at me,” Judy explained. “You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine. “I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling. Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve seen that character who drove down this road and, for some reason, you were afraid he would see you. Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?” Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied evasively, “People don’t generally enter private estates without an invitation. That’s all.” “I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided, “in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused of trespassing.” “I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two dark-coated figures strode down the road toward them. “You drove right by a NO TRESPASSING sign, and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to meet us!”"}

Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to open the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd sneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing off, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be postponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of human beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all, but seemed real and alive—except that they were also just parts of a last unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it. \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening till the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He smiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\" Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into Bruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger in the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly at Bruce. \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited. \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished. \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said. Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it. \"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you think I'd be running to?\" \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said. \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care of that, doesn't it?\" \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the revolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some sleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\" \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\" Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the gigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain didn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars eight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never got back to Earth—all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow, like little white chalk marks on a tallyboard. They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher than any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The entire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills by erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one incredible mountain.

{"chunk_id": "THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_2#0", "contents": "With Jacobs and Anhauser and the remainder of the crew of the ship, Mars V , seven judges sat in a semi-circle and Bruce stood there in front of them for the inquest. In the middle of the half-moon of inquisition, with his long legs stretched out and his hands folded on his belly, sat Captain Terrence. His uniform was black. On his arm was the silver fist insignia of the Conqueror Corps. Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there was no emotion at all on her trim, neat face. He remembered her as she had been years ago, but at the moment he wasn't looking very hard to see anything on her face. It was too late. They had gotten her young and it was too late. Terrence's big, square face frowned a little. Bruce was aware suddenly of the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastilene shelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes that had come to him in his dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he had been when he woke from them. \"This is a mere formality,\" Terrence finally said, \"since we all know you killed Lieutenant Doran a few hours ago. Marsha saw you kill him. Whatever you say goes on the record, of course.\" \"For whom?\" Bruce asked. \"What kind of question is that? For the authorities on Earth when we get back.\" \"When you get back? Like the crews of those other four ships out there?\" Bruce laughed without much humor. Terrence rubbed a palm across his lips, dropped the hand quickly again to his belly. \"You want to make a statement or not? You shot Doran in the head with a rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted enough of my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior. This is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've said too much, and done too much. Freedom doesn't allow you to go around killing fellow crew-members!\" \"Any idea that there was any democracy or freedom left died on Venus,\" Bruce said. \"Now we get another lecture!\" Terrence exploded. He leaned forward. \"You're sick, Bruce. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never have sent you on this trip. We need strength, all the strength we can find. You don't belong here.\" \"I know,\" Bruce agreed indifferently. \"I was drafted for this trip. I told them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part of it.\" \"Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you backed down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devil does Venus—?\" Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his high forehead. \"Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to the Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly educated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people.\" \"I haven't heard it,\" Terrence admitted. \"What injustice?\" Bruce said, \"I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice any longer. Values have changed"}

Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the crew of that first ship to hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One of the New Era's more infamous dates. Drexel says the Venusians were aborigines. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this village. No one knows how old it was. There were intelligent beings there. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand inhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet us. Without even an attempt at communication, they were wiped out. The village was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed.\" Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning to run down his face. He took a deep breath and stood there before the cold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes. \"No,\" Bruce said. \"I apologize. None of you know what I'm talking about.\" Terrence nodded. \"You're psycho. It's as simple as that. They pick the most capable for these conquests. Even the flights are processes of elimination. Eventually we get the very best, the most resilient, the real conquering blood. You just don't pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you think gives you the right to stand here in judgment against the laws of the whole Solar System?\" \"There are plenty on Earth who agree with me,\" Bruce said. \"I can say what I think now because you can't do more than kill me and you'll do that regardless....\" He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And theirs. They had established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The psychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had done that. If you didn't want to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human vacuum tube, you kept your mouth shut. And for many, when the mouth was kept shut long enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted to open the mouth for in the first place. A minority in both segments of a world split into two factions. Both had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, for centuries, clung to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism, individualism. To most, the words had no meaning now. It was a question of which set of conquering heroes could conquer the most space first. So far, only Venus had fallen. They had done a good, thorough job there. Four ships had come to Mars and their crews had disappeared. This was the fifth attempt—"}

When he shot what?\" Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to sharpen and rise to a kind of wail. \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke me up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we were supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got here.\" \"What kind of dreams?\" Someone laughed. \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People talk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some kind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\" Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room. \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of some of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\" Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\" \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling there's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out. You're still interested?\" Terrence nodded and glanced to either side. \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce pointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some fungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me from the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place—\" \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about scaling it.\" \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming to Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew of the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a precedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why? Because they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them? Like you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful climb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up there. \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why should I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The challenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend going before something bigger than you are stops you—it doesn't interest me.\" \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up straight and rigid. \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying, I woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was shaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either that or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the window—something was out there, looking at me.

It was late, and at first I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty, almost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling it was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in my mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking—\" His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked me what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked. Then I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too, or thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up his rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran after him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do you know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I could get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more. Neither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it. That's the way you think.\" \"What? Explain that remark.\" \"That's the philosophy of conquest—don't take any chances with aliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill everything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill everything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun away from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe that's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and that I had to kill him, so I did.\" \"Is that all, Bruce?\" \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would if I had the chance.\" \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small wiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what do you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit him? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\" Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape. \"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia is caused by inner conflict—indecision between the older values and our present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case history would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would say that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why he fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense which he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era values. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings of inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\""}

Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\" \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action? Doran must have seen something—\" \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak personality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He imagined he saw something.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did you see anything?\" She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't anything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there is to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything else. A shadow maybe—\" \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law regulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\" \"Yes. Execution.\" \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\" \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\" Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you a kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from you, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left food-concentrates to last a long time.\" \"What kind of service?\" \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the mountain.\" \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\" \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the others. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of us want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they come in.\" \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_4#0", "contents": "Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of the mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them disappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like convicts. He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much if he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative prevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so pleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as long as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity. At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were climbing. At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and that's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for—to accept a challenge like this!\" At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen masks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness and we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I can imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just to climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this! What a feeling of power, Bruce!\" From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain at forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't seem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on going. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our computations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this high could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so smooth.\" And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice that seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other four ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any of them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb—\" Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food concentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He had only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to take care of the time. From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser a few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most dependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether we should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on climbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused to accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled. So I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning anti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for us in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the weaklings are.\" Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher. Terrence,"}

We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the weaklings are.\" Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher. Terrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What a conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says, it's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but that's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can see what we are now. We can see how it's going to be—\" Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he was still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long time passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking the sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more real each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams. It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but Terrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real any more; certainly not as real as the dreams."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_5#0", "contents": "The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to worry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence was saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His dream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had left it, and it was the same—allowing even for the time difference necessitated by his periods of sleep. He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names: Pietro, Marlene, Helene. Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to him all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could also talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense. Consistently, they made sense. The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green valleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing their branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there were pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them that were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know. ' ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love—and all our own!—than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.... ' So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the dreams. And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would look out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing but seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky. \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again. The dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\" Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he couldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would die. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into himself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one compensation—he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them who had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way across the Cosmos. But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him much more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He could switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious. \"Bruce—Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure to be five hundred thousand feet! It is impossible. We keep climbing and now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is going up and up—\" And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the matter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps laughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it. Women don't have real guts.\" Bruce"}

Outside the shelter, the wind whistled softly at the door. \"Marsha,\" he said. \"Bruce—\" She hadn't said his name that way for a long time. \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember how you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I never thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't matter....\" He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper. \"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and hysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish I were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that? I really love you, after all. After all....\" Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest mountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and warm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What are you doing—reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was that, Bruce—that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last night before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_6#0", "contents": "He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the mike. He got through to her. \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\" \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling. Where you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\" He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she looked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with Marsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of that hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her, as he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren rocks. \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain, But down, my dear; And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley Will never seem fresh or clear For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water In the feathery green of the year....'\" The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound of his own voice. \"Marsha, are you still there?\" \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\" Terrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into any signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our destiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and we'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're going up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the top, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a thousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this world—the top of everything . The top of the UNIVERSE !\" Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or other—Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all—and turned into crazy yells that faded out and never came back. Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe they were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He knew they would never come back down. He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration break over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an instant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film negatives. He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was out there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet sunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there was a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the softly flowing canal water. The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent, drifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass wavered down the wind.

He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same, but useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this one, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from that world into this one of his dreams? The girl—Helene—was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette. He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but now he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between them. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown. She was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at because she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only what was. He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row of spaceships—not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd relics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships instead of four. There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building, and the other buildings. He looked up. There was no mountain."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_7#0", "contents": "For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and he was ashamed of what he had felt. What he had feared was gone now, and he knew it was gone for good and he would never have to fear it again. \"Look here, Bruce. I wondered how long it would take to get it through that thick poetic head of yours!\" \"Get what?\" He began to suspect what it was all about now, but he wasn't quite sure yet. \"Smoke?\" she said. He took one of the cigarettes and she lighted it for him and put the lighter back into her pocket. \"It's real nice here,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\" \"I guess it's about perfect.\" \"It'll be easy. Staying here, I mean. We won't be going to Earth ever again, you know.\" \"I didn't know that, but I didn't think we ever would again.\" \"We wouldn't want to anyway, would we, Bruce?\" \"No.\" He kept on looking at the place where the mountain had been. Or maybe it still was; he couldn't make up his mind yet. Which was and which was not? That barren icy world without life, or this? \"' Is all that we see or seem ,'\" he whispered, half to himself, \"' but a dream within a dream? '\" She laughed softly. \"Poe was ahead of his time,\" she said. \"You still don't get it, do you? You don't know what's been happening?\" \"Maybe I don't.\" She shrugged, and looked in the direction of the ships. \"Poor guys. I can't feel much hatred toward them now. The Martians give you a lot of understanding of the human mind—after they've accepted you, and after you've lived with them awhile. But the mountain climbers—we can see now—it's just luck, chance, we weren't like them. A deviant is a child of chance.\" \"Yes,\" Bruce said. \"There's a lot of people like us on Earth, but they'll never get the chance—the chance we seem to have here, to live decently....\" \"You're beginning to see now which was the dream,\" she said and smiled. \"But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth will get their chance, too, one of these fine days. The Conquerors aren't getting far. Venus, and then Mars, and Mars is where they stop. They'll keep coming here and climbing the mountain and finally there won't be any more. It won't take so long.\" She rose to her toes and waved and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and Marlene walking hand in hand up the other side of the canal. They waved back and called and then pushed off into the water in a small boat, and drifted away and out of sight around a gentle turn. She took his arm and they walked along the canal toward where the mountain had been, or still was—he didn't know.

There were shadows on her face as the pressure on his arm stopped him. \"I was on the first ship and Marlene on the second. None like us on the third, and on the fourth ship was Pietro. All the others had to climb the mountain—\" She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm. \"I'm very glad you came on the fifth,\" she whispered. \"Are you glad now?\" \"I'm very glad,\" he said. \"The Martians tested us,\" she explained. \"They're masters of the mind. I guess they've been grinding along through the evolutionary mill a darn long time, longer than we could estimate now. They learned the horror we're capable of from the first ship—the Conquerors, the climbers. The Martians knew more like them would come and go on into space, killing, destroying for no other reason than their own sickness. Being masters of the mind, the Martians are also capable of hypnosis—no, that's not really the word, only the closest our language comes to naming it. Suggestion so deep and strong that it seems real to one human or a million or a billion; there's no limit to the number that can be influenced. What the people who came off those ships saw wasn't real. It was partly what the Martians wanted them to see and feel—but most of it, like the desire to climb the mountain, was as much a part of the Conquerors' own psychic drive as it was the suggestion of the Martians.\" She waved her arm slowly to describe a peak. \"The Martians made the mountain real. So real that it could be seen from space, measured by instruments ... even photographed and chipped for rock samples. But you'll see how that was done, Bruce, and realize that this and not the mountain of the Conquerors is the reality of Mars. This is the Mars no Conqueror will ever see.\""}

When they came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains, actually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on walking. \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that there is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it, either, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is given an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the Conquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had to.\" He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded hills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied together with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond them were those from Mars V , too freshly dead to have decayed much ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and Marsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed to climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched out, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings. The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds, red elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve miles from the ship—horizontally. Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the fresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace beside the canal. He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that other time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so much, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of Helene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently flowing water of the cool, green canal. \"You loved her?\" \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she was young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd been older when they got her.\" He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the leaves floating down it. \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never seem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water in the feathery green of the year....'\" He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm city. He didn't look back. \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet I seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago. Are—are the climbers still climbing—somewhere, Helene?\" \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the Martians have the answer to that.\" They entered the city."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Holes_and_John_Smith_2#0", "contents": "It all began on a Saturday night at The Space Room . If you've seen any recent Martian travel folders, you know the place: \"A picturesque oasis of old Martian charm, situated on the beauteous Grand Canal in the heart of Marsport. Only half a mile from historic Chandler Field, landing site of the first Martian expedition nearly fifty years ago in 1990. A visitor to the hotel, lunch room or cocktail lounge will thrill at the sight of hardy space pioneers mingling side by side with colorful Martian tribesmen. An evening at The Space Room is an amazing, unforgettable experience.\" Of course, the folders neglect to add that the most amazing aspect is the scent of the Canal's stagnant water—and that the most unforgettable experience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\" evaporate from your pocketbook like snow from the Great Red Desert. We were sitting on the bandstand of the candle-lit cocktail lounge. Me—Jimmie Stanley—and my four-piece combo. Maybe you've seen our motto back on Earth: \"The Hottest Music This Side of Mercury.\" But there weren't four of us tonight. Only three. Ziggy, our bass fiddle man, had nearly sliced off two fingers while opening a can of Saturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing the number of our personnel by a tragic twenty-five per cent. Which was why Ke-teeli, our boss, was descending upon us with all the grace of an enraged Venusian vinosaur. \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled in his nasal tenor. He was almost skeleton thin, like most Martians, and so tall that if he fell down he'd be half way home. I gulped. \"Our bass man can't be here, but we've called the Marsport local for another. He'll be here any minute.\" Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered coldly down at me from his eight-foot-three. His eyes were like black needle points set deep in a mask of dry, ancient, reddish leather. \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\" he squeaked. I sighed. This was the week our contract ended. Goon-Face had displayed little enough enthusiasm for our music as it was. His comments were either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\" or \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkled. \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new man doesn't come, we're still here. We'll play for you.\" I glanced at the conglomeration of uniformed spacemen, white-suited tourists, and loin-clothed natives who sat at ancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't want to disappoint your customers, would you?\" Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better dey be deesappointed. Ees better no museek den bad museek.\" Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles on Martian horn-harp, made a feeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't worry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass man will be here.\" \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our red-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think I hear him coming now.\" Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the entrance. There was only silence. His naked, parchment-like chest swelled as if it were an expanding balloon. \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked. \"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And he whirled away."}

Fat Boy's two hundred and eighty-odd pounds were drooped over his chair like the blubber of an exhausted, beach-stranded whale. \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always the uranium pits of Neptune. Course, you don't live more than five years there—\" \"Maybe we could make it back to Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head. \"Using what for fare?\" I asked. \"Your brains?\" Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I guess it'll have to be the black pits of Neptune. The home of washed-up interplanetary musicians. It's too bad. We're so young, too.\" The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli was casting his razor-edged glare in our direction. I brushed the chewed finger nails from the keyboard of my electronic piano. Then it happened."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Holes_and_John_Smith_3#0", "contents": "From the entrance of The Space Room came a thumping and a grating and a banging. Suddenly, sweeping across the dance floor like a cold wind, was a bass fiddle, an enormous black monstrosity, a refugee from a pawnbroker's attic. It was queerly shaped. It was too tall, too wide. It was more like a monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass than a bass. The fiddle was not unaccompanied as I'd first imagined. Behind it, streaking over the floor in a waltz of agony, was a little guy, an animated matchstick with a flat, broad face that seemed to have been compressed in a vice. His sandcolored mop of hair reminded me of a field of dry grass, the long strands forming loops that flanked the sides of his face. His pale blue eyes were watery, like twin pools of fog. His tightfitting suit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. It was impossible to guess his age. He could have been anywhere between twenty and forty. The bass thumped down upon the bandstand. \"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John Smith, from the Marsport union.\" He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if anxious to conclude the routine of introductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late, but I was working on my plan.\" A moment's silence. \"Your plan?\" I echoed at last. \"How to get back home,\" he snapped as if I should have known it already. Hummm, I thought. My gaze turned to the dance floor. Goon-Face had his eyes on us, and they were as cold as six Indians going South. \"We'll talk about your plan at intermission,\" I said, shivering. \"Now, we'd better start playing. John, do you know On An Asteroid With You ?\" \"I know everything ,\" said John Smith. I turned to my piano with a shudder. I didn't dare look at that horrible fiddle again. I didn't dare think what kind of soul-chilling tones might emerge from its ancient depths. And I didn't dare look again at the second monstrosity, the one named John Smith. I closed my eyes and plunged into a four-bar intro. Hammer-Head joined in on vibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet, and then— My eyes burst open. A shiver coursed down my spine like gigantic mice feet. The tones that surged from that monstrous bass were ecstatic. They were out of a jazzman's Heaven. They were great rolling clouds that seemed to envelop the entire universe with their vibrance. They held a depth and a volume and a richness that were astounding, that were like no others I'd ever heard. First they went Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom , and then, boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom , just like the tones of all bass fiddles. But there was something else, too. There were overtones, so that John wasn't just playing a single note, but a whole chord with each beat. And the fullness, the depth of those incredible chords actually set my blood tingling. I could feel the tingling just as one can feel the vibration of a plucked guitar string. I glanced at the cash customers. They looked like weary warriors"}

I could feel the tingling just as one can feel the vibration of a plucked guitar string. I glanced at the cash customers. They looked like weary warriors getting their first glimpse of Valhalla. Gap-jawed and wide-eyed, they seemed in a kind of ecstatic hypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced Martians stopped sipping their wine-syrup and nodded their dark heads in time with the rhythm. I looked at The Eye. The transformation of his gaunt features was miraculous. Shadows of gloom dissolved and were replaced by a black-toothed, crescent-shaped smile of delight. His eyes shone like those of a kid seeing Santa Claus. We finished On An Asteroid With You , modulated into Sweet Sally from Saturn and finished with Tighten Your Lips on Titan . We waited for the applause of the Earth people and the shrilling of the Martians to die down. Then I turned to John and his fiddle. \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped, \"I wouldn't believe it!\" \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\" added Hammer-Head who, although sober, seemed quite drunk. \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of course it's old. It's over five thousand years old. I was lucky to find it in a pawnshop. Only it's not a fiddle but a Zloomph . This is the only one in existence.\" He patted the thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole in it but it isn't the right one.\" I wondered what the hell he was talking about. I studied the black, mirror-like wood. The aperture in the vesonator was like that of any bass fiddle. \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to ask. He turned his sad eyes to me. \"For going home,\" he said. Hummm, I thought."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Holes_and_John_Smith_4#0", "contents": "We played. Tune after tune. John knew them all, from the latest pop melodies to a swing version of the classic Rhapsody of The Stars . He was a quiet guy during the next couple of hours, and getting more than a few words from him seemed as hard as extracting a tooth. He'd stand by his fiddle—I mean, his Zloomph —with a dreamy expression in those watery eyes, staring at nothing. But after one number he studied Fat Boy's clarinet for a moment. \"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an unusual hole in the front.\" Fat Boy scratched the back of his head. \"You—you mean here? Where the music comes out?\" John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\" Hummm, I thought again. Awhile later I caught him eyeing my piano keyboard. \"What's the matter, John?\" He pointed. \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette fell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole in the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll swear at me in seven languages.\" \"Even there,\" he said softly, \"even there....\" There was no doubt about it. John Smith was peculiar, but he was the best bass man this side of a musician's Nirvana. It didn't take a genius to figure out our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's countenance had evidenced an excellent imitation of Mephistopheles before John began to play. Item two: Goon-Face had beamed like a kitten with a quart of cream after John began to play. Conclusion: If we wanted to keep eating, we'd have to persuade John Smith to join our combo. At intermission I said, \"How about a drink, John? Maybe a shot of wine-syrup?\" He shook his head. \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\" His grunt was negative. \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\" He smiled. \"Yes, I like beer.\" I escorted him to the bar and assisted him in his arduous climb onto a stool. \"John,\" I ventured after he'd taken an experimental sip, \"where have you been hiding? A guy like you should be playing every night.\" John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured I might need some money so I went to the union. Then I worked on my plan.\" \"Then you need a job. How about playing with us steady? We like your style a lot.\" He made a long, low humming sound which I interpreted as an expression of intense concentration. \"I don't know,\" he finally drawled. \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration struck me. \"And listen, I have an apartment. It's got everything, solar shower, automatic chef, 'copter landing—if we ever get a 'copter. Plenty of room there for two people. You can stay with me and it won't cost you a cent. And we'll even pay you over union wages.\" His watery gaze wandered lazily to the bar mirror, down to the glittering array of bottles and then out to the dance floor. He yawned again and spoke slowly, as if each word were a leaden weight cast reluctantly from his tongue: \"No, I don't ... care much ... about playing.\" \"What do you like to do, John?\" His string-bean of a body stiffened."}

I took a deep breath. \"Tell me about it, John. It must be interesting.\" He made queer clicking noises with his mouth that reminded me of a mechanical toy being wound into motion. \"The whole foundation of this or any other culture is based on the history of all the time dimensions, each interwoven with the other, throughout the ages. And the holes provide a means of studying all of it first hand.\" Oh, oh , I thought. But you still have to eat. Remember, you still have to eat. \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there are so many holes in this universe.\" \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face. \"Certainly. Look around you. All you see is holes. These beer bottles are just holes surrounded by glass. The doors and windows—they're holes in walls. The mine tunnels make a network of holes under the desert. Caves are holes, animals live in holes, our faces have holes, clothes have holes—millions and millions of holes!\" I winced and thought, humor him because you gotta eat, you gotta eat. His voice trembled with emotion. \"Why, they're everywhere. They're in pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket jets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes and well holes, and shoelace holes. There are doughnut holes and stocking holes and woodpecker holes and cheese holes. Oceans lie in holes in the earth, and rivers and canals and valleys. The craters of the Moon are holes. Everything is—\" \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as possible, \"what have these holes got to do with you?\" He glowered at me as if I were unworthy of such a confidence. \"What have they to do with me?\" he shrilled. \"I can't find the right one—that's what!\" I closed my eyes. \"Which particular hole are you looking for, John?\" He was speaking rapidly again now. \"I was hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph to prove a point of ancient history to those fools. They don't believe that instruments which make music actually existed before the tapes! It was dark—and some fool researcher had forgotten to set a force-field over the hole—I fell through.\" I closed my eyes. \"Now wait a minute. Did you drop something, lose it in the hole—is that why you have to find it?\" \"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\" he snapped, \" just my own time dimension. And if I don't get back they will think I couldn't prove my theory, that I'm ashamed to come back,"}

Then he straightened. \"But there's still time for my plan to work out—with the relative difference taken into account. Only I get so tired just thinking about it.\" \"Yes, I can see where thinking about it would tire any one.\" He nodded. \"But it can't be too far away.\" \"I'd like to hear more about it,\" I said. \"But if you're not going to play with us—\" \"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he beamed. \"I can talk to you . You understand.\" Thank heaven!"}
{"chunk_id": "The_Holes_and_John_Smith_5#0", "contents": "Heaven lasted for just three days. During those seventy-two golden hours the melodious tinkling of The Eye's cash register was as constant as that of Santa's sleigh bells. John became the hero of tourists, spacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless he remained stubbornly aloof. He was quiet, moody, playing his Zloomph automatically. He'd reveal definite indications of belonging to Homo Sapiens only when drinking beer and talking about his holes. Goon-Face was still cautious. \"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe. We see. Eef feedleman stay, we have contract. He stay, yes?\" \"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay—just as long as you want him.\" \"Den he sign contract, too. No beeg feedle, no contract.\" \"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\" I laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry, Mr. Ke-teeli.\" Just a few minutes later tragedy struck. A reporter from the Marsport Times ambled into interview the Man of The Hour. The interview, unfortunately, was conducted over the bar and accompanied by a generous guzzling of beer. Fat Boy, Hammer-Head and I watched from a table. Knowing John as we did, a silent prayer was in our eyes. \"This is the first time he's talked to anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed. \"I—I'm scared. \"Nothing can happen,\" I said, optimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\" We watched. John murmured something. The reporter, a paunchy, balding man, scribbled furiously in his notebook. John yawned, muttered something else. The reporter continued to scribble. John sipped beer. His eyes brightened, and he began to talk more rapidly. The reporter frowned, stopped writing, and studied John curiously. John finished his first beer, started on his second. His eyes were wild, and he was talking more and more rapidly. \"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head groaned. \"He's telling him!\" I rose swiftly. \"We better get over there. We should have known better—\" We were too late. The reporter had already slapped on his hat and was striding to the exit. John turned to us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing like air from a punctured balloon. \"He wouldn't listen,\" he said, weakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he said he'd come back when I'm sober. I'm sober now. So I quit. I've got to find my hole.\" I patted him on the back. \"No, John, we'll help you. Don't quit. We'll—well, we'll help you.\" \"We're working on a plan, too,\" said Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration. \"We're going to make a more scientific approach.\" \"How?\" John asked. Fat Boy gulped. \"Just wait another day,\" I said. \"We'll have it worked out. Just be patient another day. You can't leave now, not after all your work.\" \"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll stay—until tomorrow.\""}

Unable to sleep the next morning, I left John to his snoring and went for an aspirin and black coffee. All the possible schemes were drumming through my mind: finding an Earth blonde to capture John's interest, having him electro-hypnotized, breaking his leg, forging a letter from this mythical university telling him his theory was proved valid and for him to take a nice long vacation now. He was a screwball about holes and force fields and dimensional worlds but for that music of his I'd baby him the rest of his life. It was early afternoon when I trudged back to my apartment. John was squatting on the living room floor, surrounded by a forest of empty beer bottles. His eyes were bulging, his hair was even wilder than usual, and he was swaying. \"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\" His watery eyes squinted at me. \"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm awful scared!\" \"But you mustn't be scared. That reporter was just stupid. We'll help you with your theory.\" His body trembled. \"No, it isn't that. It isn't the reporter.\" \"Then what is it, John?\" \"It's my body. It's—\" \"Yes, what about your body? Are you sick?\" His face was white with terror. \"No, my— my body's full of holes . Suppose it's one of those holes! How will I get back if it is?\" He rose and staggered to his Zloomph , clutching it as though it were somehow a source of strength and consolation. I patted him gingerly on the arm. \"Now John. You've just had too much beer, that's all. Let's go out and get some air and some strong black coffee. C'mon now.\" We staggered out into the morning darkness, the three of us. John, the Zloomph , and I. I was hanging on to him trying to see around and over and even under the Zloomph —steering by a sort of radar-like sixth sense. The street lights on Marsport are pretty dim compared to Earthside. I didn't see the open manhole that the workmen had figured would be all right at that time of night. It gets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M. of a Martian morning, and I guess the men were warming up with a little nip at the bar across the street. Then—he was gone. John just slipped out of my grasp— Zloomph and all—and was gone—completely and irrevocably gone. I even risked a broken neck and jumped in the manhole after him. Nothing—nothing but the smell of ozone and an echo bouncing crazily off the walls of the conduit. \"—is it.—is it.—is it.—is it.\" John Smith was gone, so utterly and completely and tragically gone it was as if he'd never existed...."}

Minutes later, he was back up the aisle and swaying giddily over the little housewife. \"How!\" he said. \"Me Chief Broken Wing. You wanta Indian wrestle?\" The girl, who sat nervously staring at him, smiled wanly, and shook her head. \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he burbled affectionately, crashing into the seat beside her. The two men slid out of their seats, and a hand clamped his shoulder. \"Come on, Broken Wing, let's go back to bed.\" \"My name's Hogey,\" he said. \"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding about being a Indian.\" \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a drink.\" They got him on his feet, and led him stumbling back down the aisle. \"My ma was half Cherokee, see? That's how come I said it. You wanta hear a war whoop? Real stuff.\" \"Never mind.\" He cupped his hands to his mouth and favored them with a blood-curdling proof of his ancestry, while the female passengers stirred restlessly and hunched in their seats. The driver stopped the bus and went back to warn him against any further display. The driver flashed a deputy's badge and threatened to turn him over to a constable. \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey told him. \"I got me a son now, that's why. You know? A little baby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen him yet.\" \"Will you just sit still and be quiet then, eh?\" Big Hogey nodded emphatically. \"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to make any trouble.\" When the bus started again, he fell on his side and lay still. He made retching sounds for a time, then rested, snoring softly. The bus driver woke him again at Caine's junction, retrieved his gin bottle from behind the seat, and helped him down the aisle and out of the bus. Big Hogey stumbled about for a moment, then sat down hard in the gravel at the shoulder of the road. The driver paused with one foot on the step, looking around.

Big Hogey stumbled about for a moment, then sat down hard in the gravel at the shoulder of the road. The driver paused with one foot on the step, looking around. There was not even a store at the road junction, but only a freight building next to the railroad track, a couple of farmhouses at the edge of a side-road, and, just across the way, a deserted filling station with a sagging roof. The land was Great Plains country, treeless, barren, and rolling. Big Hogey got up and staggered around in front of the bus, clutching at it for support, losing his duffle bag. \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The driver warned. With a surge of unwelcome compassion he trotted around after his troublesome passenger, taking his arm as he sagged again. \"You crossing?\" \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme alone, I'm okay.\" The driver started across the highway with him. The traffic was sparse, but fast and dangerous in the central ninety-mile lane. \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting. \"I'm a tumbler, ya know? Gravity's got me. Damn gravity. I'm not used to gravity, ya know? I used to be a tumbler— huk! —only now I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count of li'l Hogey. You know about li'l Hogey?\" \"Yeah. Your son. Come on.\" \"Say, you gotta son? I bet you gotta son.\" \"Two kids,\" said the driver, catching Hogey's bag as it slipped from his shoulder. \"Both girls.\" \"Say, you oughta be home with them kids. Man oughta stick with his family. You oughta get another job.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly, waggled a moralistic finger, skidded on the gravel as they stepped onto the opposite shoulder, and sprawled again. The driver blew a weary breath, looked down at him, and shook his head. Maybe it'd be kinder to find a constable after all. This guy could get himself killed, wandering around loose. \"Somebody supposed to meet you?\" he asked, squinting around at the dusty hills. \" Huk! —who, me?\" Hogey giggled, belched, and shook his head. \"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming. S'prise. I'm supposed to be here a week ago.\" He looked up at the driver with a pained expression. \"Week late, ya know? Marie's gonna be sore—woo- hoo !—is she gonna be sore!\" He waggled his head severely at the ground. \"Which way are you going?\" the driver grunted impatiently. Hogey pointed down the side-road that led back into the hills. \"Marie's pop's place. You know where? 'Bout three miles from here. Gotta walk, I guess.\" \"Don't,\" the driver warned. \"You sit there by the culvert till you get a ride. Okay?\" Hogey nodded forlornly. \"Now stay out of the road,\" the driver warned, then hurried back across the highway. Moments later, the atomic battery-driven motors droned mournfully, and the bus pulled away. Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Nice people,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people. All hoofers.\" With a grunt and a lurch,"}

All hoofers.\" With a grunt and a lurch, he got to his feet, but his legs wouldn't work right. With his tumbler's reflexes, he fought to right himself with frantic arm motions, but gravity claimed him, and he went stumbling into the ditch. \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\" he cried. The bottom of the ditch was wet, and he crawled up the embankment with mud-soaked knees, and sat on the shoulder again. The gin bottle was still intact. He had himself a long fiery drink, and it warmed him deep down. He blinked around at the gaunt and treeless land. The sun was almost down, forge-red on a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked sky faded into sulphurous yellow toward the zenith, and the very air that hung over the land seemed full of yellow smoke, the omnipresent dust of the plains. A farm truck turned onto the side-road and moaned away, its driver hardly glancing at the dark young man who sat swaying on his duffle bag near the culvert. Hogey scarcely noticed the vehicle. He just kept staring at the crazy sun. He shook his head. It wasn't really the sun. The sun, the real sun, was a hateful eye-sizzling horror in the dead black pit. It painted everything with pure white pain, and you saw things by the reflected pain-light. The fat red sun was strictly a phoney, and it didn't fool him any. He hated it for what he knew it was behind the gory mask, and for what it had done to his eyes. With a grunt, he got to his feet, managed to shoulder the duffle bag, and started off down the middle of the farm road, lurching from side to side, and keeping his eyes on the rolling distances. Another car turned onto the side-road, honking angrily. Hogey tried to turn around to look at it, but he forgot to shift his footing. He staggered and went down on the pavement. The car's tires screeched on the hot asphalt. Hogey lay there for a moment, groaning. That one had hurt his hip. A car door slammed and a big man with a florid face got out and stalked toward him, looking angry. \"What the hell's the matter with you, fella?\" he drawled. \"You soused? Man, you've really got a load.\" Hogey got up doggedly, shaking his head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he prevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't stand the gravity.\" The burly farmer retrieved his gin bottle for him, still miraculously unbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\" he grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better get home pronto.\" \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest, I'm just space burned."}

Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest, I'm just space burned. You know?\" \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway? Do you live around here?\" It was obvious that the big man had taken him for a hobo or a tramp. Hogey pulled himself together. \"Goin' to the Hauptman's place. Marie. You know Marie?\" The farmer's eyebrows went up. \"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know her. Only she's Marie Parker now. Has been, nigh on six years. Say—\" He paused, then gaped. \"You ain't her husband by any chance?\" \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey Parker.\" \"Well, I'll be—! Get in the car. I'm going right past John Hauptman's place. Boy, you're in no shape to walk it.\" He grinned wryly, waggled his head, and helped Hogey and his bag into the back seat. A woman with a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly beside the farmer in the front, and she neither greeted the passenger nor looked around. \"They don't make cars like this anymore,\" the farmer called over the growl of the ancient gasoline engine and the grind of gears. \"You can have them new atomics with their loads of hot isotopes under the seat. Ain't safe, I say—eh, Martha?\" The woman with the sun-baked neck quivered her head slightly. \"A car like this was good enough for Pa, an' I reckon it's good enough for us,\" she drawled mournfully. Five minutes later the car drew in to the side of the road. \"Reckon you can walk it from here,\" the farmer said. \"That's Hauptman's road just up ahead.\" He helped Hogey out of the car and drove away without looking back to see if Hogey stayed on his feet. The woman with the sun-baked neck was suddenly talking garrulously in his direction. It was twilight. The sun had set, and the yellow sky was turning gray. Hogey was too tired to go on, and his legs would no longer hold him. He blinked around at the land, got his eyes focused, and found what looked like Hauptman's place on a distant hillside. It was a big frame house surrounded by a wheatfield, and a few scrawny trees. Having located it, he stretched out in the tall grass beyond the ditch to take a little rest. Somewhere dogs were barking, and a cricket sang creaking monotony in the grass. Once there was the distant thunder of a rocket blast from the launching station six miles to the west, but it faded quickly. An A-motored convertible whined past on the road, but Hogey went unseen.

Once there was the distant thunder of a rocket blast from the launching station six miles to the west, but it faded quickly. An A-motored convertible whined past on the road, but Hogey went unseen. When he awoke, it was night, and he was shivering. His stomach was screeching, and his nerves dancing with high voltages. He sat up and groped for his watch, then remembered he had pawned it after the poker game. Remembering the game and the results of the game made him wince and bite his lip and grope for the bottle again. He sat breathing heavily for a moment after the stiff drink. Equating time to position had become second nature with him, but he had to think for a moment because his defective vision prevented him from seeing the Earth-crescent. Vega was almost straight above him in the late August sky, so he knew it wasn't much after sundown—probably about eight o'clock. He braced himself with another swallow of gin, picked himself up and got back to the road, feeling a little sobered after the nap. He limped on up the pavement and turned left at the narrow drive that led between barbed-wire fences toward the Hauptman farmhouse, five hundred yards or so from the farm road. The fields on his left belonged to Marie's father, he knew. He was getting close—close to home and woman and child. He dropped the bag suddenly and leaned against a fence post, rolling his head on his forearms and choking in spasms of air. He was shaking all over, and his belly writhed. He wanted to turn and run. He wanted to crawl out in the grass and hide. What were they going to say? And Marie, Marie most of all. How was he going to tell her about the money? Six hitches in space, and every time the promise had been the same: One more tour, baby, and we'll have enough dough, and then I'll quit for good. One more time, and we'll have our stake—enough to open a little business, or buy a house with a mortgage and get a job. And she had waited, but the money had never been quite enough until this time. This time the tour had lasted nine months, and he had signed on for every run from station to moon-base to pick up the bonuses. And this time he'd made it. Two weeks ago, there had been forty-eight hundred in the bank. And now ... \" Why? \" he groaned, striking his forehead against his forearms. His arm slipped, and his head hit the top of the fencepost, and the pain blinded him for a moment. He staggered back into the road with a low roar, wiped blood from his forehead, and savagely kicked his bag. It rolled a couple of yards up the road. He leaped after it and kicked it again.

He staggered back into the road with a low roar, wiped blood from his forehead, and savagely kicked his bag. It rolled a couple of yards up the road. He leaped after it and kicked it again. When he had finished with it, he stood panting and angry, but feeling better. He shouldered the bag and hiked on toward the farmhouse. They're hoofers, that's all—just an Earth-chained bunch of hoofers, even Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A born tumbler. Know what that means? It means—God, what does it mean? It means out in Big Bottomless, where Earth's like a fat moon with fuzzy mold growing on it. Mold, that's all you are, just mold. A dog barked, and he wondered if he had been muttering aloud. He came to a fence-gap and paused in the darkness. The road wound around and came up the hill in front of the house. Maybe they were sitting on the porch. Maybe they'd already heard him coming. Maybe ... He was trembling again. He fished the fifth of gin out of his coat pocket and sloshed it. Still over half a pint. He decided to kill it. It wouldn't do to go home with a bottle sticking out of his pocket. He stood there in the night wind, sipping at it, and watching the reddish moon come up in the east. The moon looked as phoney as the setting sun. He straightened in sudden determination. It had to be sometime. Get it over with, get it over with now. He opened the fence-gap, slipped through, and closed it firmly behind him. He retrieved his bag, and waded quietly through the tall grass until he reached the hedge which divided an area of sickly peach trees from the field. He got over the hedge somehow, and started through the trees toward the house. He stumbled over some old boards, and they clattered. \" Shhh! \" he hissed, and moved on. The dogs were barking angrily, and he heard a screen door slam. He stopped. \"Ho there!\" a male voice called experimentally from the house. One of Marie's brothers. Hogey stood frozen in the shadow of a peach tree, waiting. \"Anybody out there?\" the man called again. Hogey waited, then heard the man muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic 'im.\" The hound's bark became eager. The animal came chasing down the slope, and stopped ten feet away to crouch and bark frantically at the shadow in the gloom. He knew the dog. \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky boy—here!\" The dog stopped barking, sniffed, trotted closer, and went \" Rrrooff! \" Then he started sniffing suspiciously again. \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he whispered. The dog came forward silently, sniffed his hand, and whined in recognition. Then he trotted around Hogey, panting doggy affection and dancing an invitation to romp. The man whistled from the"}

The dog froze, then trotted quickly back up the slope. \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the man on the porch said. \"Chasin' armadillos again, eh?\" The screen door slammed again, and the porch light went out. Hogey stood there staring, unable to think. Somewhere beyond the window lights were—his woman, his son. What the hell was a tumbler doing with a woman and a son? After perhaps a minute, he stepped forward again. He tripped over a shovel, and his foot plunged into something that went squelch and swallowed the foot past the ankle. He fell forward into a heap of sand, and his foot went deeper into the sloppy wetness. He lay there with his stinging forehead on his arms, cursing softly and crying. Finally he rolled over, pulled his foot out of the mess, and took off his shoes. They were full of mud—sticky sandy mud. The dark world was reeling about him, and the wind was dragging at his breath. He fell back against the sand pile and let his feet sink in the mud hole and wriggled his toes. He was laughing soundlessly, and his face was wet in the wind. He couldn't think. He couldn't remember where he was and why, and he stopped caring, and after a while he felt better. The stars were swimming over him, dancing crazily, and the mud cooled his feet, and the sand was soft behind him. He saw a rocket go up on a tail of flame from the station, and waited for the sound of its blast, but he was already asleep when it came. It was far past midnight when he became conscious of the dog licking wetly at his ear and cheek. He pushed the animal away with a low curse and mopped at the side of his face. He stirred, and groaned. His feet were burning up! He tried to pull them toward him, but they wouldn't budge. There was something wrong with his legs. For an instant he stared wildly around in the night. Then he remembered where he was, closed his eyes and shuddered. When he opened them again, the moon had emerged from behind a cloud, and he could see clearly the cruel trap into which he had accidentally stumbled. A pile of old boards, a careful stack of new lumber, a pick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps of fresh-turned earth, and a concrete mixer—well, it added up. He gripped his ankles and pulled, but his feet wouldn't budge. In sudden terror, he tried to stand up, but his ankles were clutched by the"}

He gripped his ankles and pulled, but his feet wouldn't budge. In sudden terror, he tried to stand up, but his ankles were clutched by the concrete too, and he fell back in the sand with a low moan. He lay still for several minutes, considering carefully. He pulled at his left foot. It was locked in a vise. He tugged even more desperately at his right foot. It was equally immovable. He sat up with a whimper and clawed at the rough concrete until his nails tore and his fingertips bled. The surface still felt damp, but it had hardened while he slept. He sat there stunned until Hooky began licking at his scuffed fingers. He shouldered the dog away, and dug his hands into the sand-pile to stop the bleeding. Hooky licked at his face, panting love. \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely. The dog whined softly, trotted a short distance away, circled, and came back to crouch down in the sand directly before Hogey, inching forward experimentally. Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry sand and cursed between his teeth, while his eyes wandered over the sky. They came to rest on the sliver of light—the space station—rising in the west, floating out in Big Bottomless where the gang was—Nichols and Guerrera and Lavrenti and Fats. And he wasn't forgetting Keesey, the rookie who'd replaced him. Keesey would have a rough time for a while—rough as a cob. The pit was no playground. The first time you went out of the station in a suit, the pit got you. Everything was falling, and you fell, with it. Everything. The skeletons of steel, the tire-shaped station, the spheres and docks and nightmare shapes—all tied together by umbilical cables and flexible tubes. Like some crazy sea-thing they seemed, floating in a black ocean with its tentacles bound together by drifting strands in the dark tide that bore it. Everything was pain-bright or dead black, and it wheeled around you, and you went nuts trying to figure which way was down. In fact, it took you months to teach your body that all ways were down and that the pit was bottomless. He became conscious of a plaintive sound in the wind, and froze to listen. It was a baby crying. It was nearly a minute before he got the significance of it. It hit him where he lived, and he began jerking frantically at his encased feet and sobbing low in his throat. They'd hear him if he kept that up. He stopped and covered his ears to close out the cry of his firstborn. A light went on in the house, and when it went off again, the infant's cry had ceased.

He stopped and covered his ears to close out the cry of his firstborn. A light went on in the house, and when it went off again, the infant's cry had ceased. Another rocket went up from the station, and he cursed it. Space was a disease, and he had it. \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly. \"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\" He knew he was yelling hysterically at the sky and fighting the relentless concrete that clutched his feet, and after a moment he stopped. The light was on in the house again, and he heard faint sounds. The stirring-about woke the baby again, and once more the infant's wail came on the breeze. Make the kid shut up, make the kid shut up ... But that was no good. It wasn't the kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's fault. No fathers allowed in space, they said, but it wasn't their fault either. They were right, and he had only himself to blame. The kid was an accident, but that didn't change anything. Not a thing in the world. It remained a tragedy. A tumbler had no business with a family, but what was a man going to do? Take a skinning knife, boy, and make yourself a eunuch. But that was no good either. They needed bulls out there in the pit, not steers. And when a man came down from a year's hitch, what was he going to do? Live in a lonely shack and read books for kicks? Because you were a man, you sought out a woman. And because she was a woman, she got a kid, and that was the end of it. It was nobody's fault, nobody's at all. He stared at the red eye of Mars low in the southwest. They were running out there now, and next year he would have been on the long long run ... But there was no use thinking about it. Next year and the years after belonged to little Hogey. He sat there with his feet locked in the solid concrete of the footing, staring out into Big Bottomless while his son's cry came from the house and the Hauptman menfolk came wading through the tall grass in search of someone who had cried out. His feet were stuck tight, and he wouldn't ever get them out. He was sobbing softly when they found him. Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Fantastic Universe September 1955.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Snaddra had but one choice in its fight to afford to live belowground—underhandedly pretend theirs was an aboveboard society! \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm. \"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\" \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru protested. \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours. It's forever.\" \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\" Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe. \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\" Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber. \"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\" There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face—an obviously insincere regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had always felt about the girl. \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood. This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on living at all.\" \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but the welfare of our planet comes first.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Ignoble_Savages_2#0", "contents": "She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw. No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You—\" \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\" Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe. However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt. \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in these arrangements, I hardly think you—a mere private citizen—have the right to question them.\" \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said, whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\" \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of all and now—\" \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some time.\" Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized. I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae—if he were to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final humiliation. \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her fiance—her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused all such ties to be severed—and every other literate person on the planet, had received her education at the local university. Although sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are behaving in a beggarly manner!\" \"And I have already explained"}

So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the ground during the day, like—like savages.\" \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning. \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\" Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\" \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\" \"But I can't work metal!\" \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a trade.\" \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd better give you back your grimpatch—\" Larhgan handed the glittering bauble to him—\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\" \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru yelled, twirling madly in the air. \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career. Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\" \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly with the high priestess's robes.\" Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy, even though my heart will be breaking.\" It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's problem. \"Listen—\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered down from overhead. It was too late. \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom. \"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\" Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash. \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\""}

He looked pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his own appearance—which was, although picturesque enough to delight romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most hardened sadist. \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\" \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was wrong with our old culture, anyway?\" That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate his mind that school-days were long since over. \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar; it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the other—and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\" \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart in a gesture which, though devout on Earth—or so the fictapes seemed to indicate—was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been such a nice girl, too. \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me—and I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with Bbulas.\" \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\" \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\" All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you, Skkiru,\" she said brokenly. Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a triple silence."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Ignoble_Savages_5#0", "contents": "\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes, and singing a popular ballad—to which less ribald, as well as less inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible. \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar. His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor—now a pariah, of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers—and the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport, having previously found it unnecessary—but now both air-cars and self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently primitive. The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly in the wet season or—more properly speaking on Snaddra—the wetter season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be humanoid. As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to—the weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment—and it was the matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way, and get it. Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it."}

Only the peculiarly pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb. In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms, entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had always understood, who had invented the art of retouching—thus proving beyond a doubt that they had something to hide. \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran—which the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on that little planet in the Arcturus system—what was its name? Glotch, that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\" \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How horrible!\" \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human—another species entirely—so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\" \"And the missionaries—did they soften them up, Cyril?\" \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah, well, it's all in the day's work.\" \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming procession— creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff. \"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\" \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\" Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials—which had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite. \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with"}

How could any intelligent life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite. \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some slight differences, of course—but, if two eyes are beautiful, three eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my favorite color.\" If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal healthy emerald to a sickly celadon."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Ignoble_Savages_7#0", "contents": "Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be—a robot would be better constructed and less interested in females than Raoul. \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\" \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly. Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of exchange here?\" Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this piece of information, helpful though it would be. \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged. \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\" \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily. \"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be a universal one.\" \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\" Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable—and entirely genuine—murmurs of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the planet's delicacy shops—and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his rocker. To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession, Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much weather all at once. On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they often sickened of it and passed on—which helped to solve the problem of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed no such measures, for its population—like its natural resources—was dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Ignoble_Savages_8#0", "contents": "Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small, momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks. For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple—a ramshackle affair, but then it had been run up in only three days—where the official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that, because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at him—and not only for his forwardness—that was in character on both sides, too. Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising—a poetic thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the easy way out. Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the Snaddrath depended upon imports. As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by Bbulas—who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker, for there was no end to the man's conceit. The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so lovely and so remote. \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here as you did on Nemeth....\" Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in contemplating Larhgan's apparently"}

And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\" The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on, apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended. \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\" Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha! \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\" \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\" Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts to feel sorry for the man. \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\" \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now, but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color, such aroma!\" Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff. \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing as mud....\" The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\" He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However, that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability. In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned the various roles so that each person would be making a definite contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums, like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship. What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg? Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been accustomed to see basking in"}

It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral, although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die for his planet in many ways—but wantonly starving to death as the result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them. All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities. He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of them, and stave off his doom for a while—but that would not be playing the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan. As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and much more cheaply. It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life. What resources it once possessed had been depleted and—aside from minerals—they had never been very extensive to begin with. All life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and rice—the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist business. Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in."}

However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm—and there, Skkiru felt, was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top. The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the population. The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve the planet when an emergency came—and this, old Luccar, the former President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had, after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method of saving Snaddra—and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last, had come up with this program. It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath, largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and, as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of the planet, there was no choice. But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his anthropological viewings—though Bbulas might have been the only one privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was not the only one who could use a library—seen accounts of societies where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy of the high priestess's hand—which would be entirely in the Terran primitive tradition of romance. \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\" Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of collecting junk and I thought—\" Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave all the thinking to me!\" \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly."}

THE LITTLE RED BAG By JERRY SOHL [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made the discovery. I had finished reading the Chronicle , folded and put it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde. I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a window where there was nothing to see. I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a togetherness-type-magazine reader. Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles for, and not wanting to. So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever complained. It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers and—well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble. It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me how they hurt. Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to become pretty good at guessing. Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it—a lipstick. A round, hard object with dust inside—a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small book, probably an address book, money in a change purse—a few bills and coins. Not much else. I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time. But I never say anything."}

This was the punishment for some minor infraction. Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during her absence, which I dutifully did. Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk. \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out. I was sent home with a stinging note. Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine. I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the things I sense in probing really are. But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's window. And I can stop clocks. Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting influence to decrease the restoring torque. The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I can't stand the alarm. When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.

So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane. The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out the window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced at her wristwatch and sank back again. Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a ukulele. I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first. The bomb was in a small bag—a woman's bag judging by the soft, flimsy things you'd never find in a man's—and I didn't know it was a bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small, quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my neck when I suddenly realized what it was. The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go. It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal. My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way. We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there. But of course that had been the plan! My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb"}

My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be panic and they'd never get the plane down in time—if they believed me. \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle, smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a napkin. I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her. I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried to close everything off—the throb of engines, the rush of air, the woman sipping coffee noisily beside me—and I went into the clock and surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back; when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to stop it. Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold until it came to a dead stop. \"Anything the matter?\" My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was still chewing. \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\" \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back and forth.\" \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else, just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_3#0", "contents": "All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still. I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions. Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock—but not before the bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man literally with gimlet eyes. Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below, but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide. To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped. A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled. \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing. I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took it without a word and went away. \"Were you really asleep that time?\" \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to fits, but I didn't. It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when the plane dipped and bumped to a landing. Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other. So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been. It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The assortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded and placed in a long rack. I went with it. There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases, and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast"}

There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases, and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was the attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one. I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously. I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_4#0", "contents": "The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it toward me. \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the remaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\" \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But he was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look. I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\" \"Take it inside. Why?\" He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\" I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying over. \"Cab?\" I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\" Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb. I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied me. I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to live with myself. No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until what? A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own business. But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him, \"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim counter out of the side of my eye. The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk.

Picking up my own suitcase, I went inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room. I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How many minutes—or seconds—were left? I was sweating when I moved to the counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the clock again. \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked. \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\" I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel escaped my grasp. \"Do you have my suitcase?\" I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand she had a green baggage claim check. The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up, glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it. \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying after her."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_5#0", "contents": "At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, \"Listen to me.\" She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door. \"It's a matter of life or death,\" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I restrained myself. She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said, \"Please put the bag down. Over there.\" I indicated a spot beside a telephone booth where it would be out of the way. She didn't move. She just said, \"Why?\" \"For God's sake!\" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was, I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me or anything else right now if it had. \"I've got to talk to you. It's very important.\" The girl said, \"Why?\" I was beginning to think it was the only word she knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill someone so lovely. \"I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a telephone call.\" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, \"And don't ask me why.\" She gave me a speculative look. I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, \"All right, but—\" I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door, pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel. Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet. \"Now will you please tell me what this is all about?\" she said stiffly. \"Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.\" She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed the short, fat man into the coffee shop. Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag. During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag. \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but staring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes she was reliving some recent scene. \"Who is Joe?\" \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got"}

I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put in some books we'd both finished reading—for my sister. That's when he must have put the—put it in there.\" I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\" \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I want to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy. \"It's all right now?\" she asked. I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\" I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her name was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it would have to do. \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for his coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_6#0", "contents": "I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her. I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy for a long while. \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried. She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all for me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\" It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again when we reached the lobby. The two bags weren't there. I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap. \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered suitcase?\" \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just stepped out of here—\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\" The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand, mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry. \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him. The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in. The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the redcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\" \"That he did,\" I said. Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the parking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\" The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get over to the office.\" But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard. \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky. \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to me.\" We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was thinking. She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me. The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\" \"I—I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\" \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't bother to report it?\" \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't make you report it.\" \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some air. Can't we walk a little?\" \"Sure,\" I said. We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill with"}

Inside, a heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the opposite corner of his mouth. \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of authority. Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while, though.\" The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What brings you back to the boondocks?\" \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\" In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\" Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\" \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings. \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction pattern—\" \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your word for it.\" \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\" \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says is a time machine.

But this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town, practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy shay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram in front of her.\" Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess. Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\" \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of detector you were going to set up?\" \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up in my room over at the hotel.\" \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\" \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely repeating logarithmic sequence, based on—\" \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me know if you want anything. And by the way—\" he winked broadly—\"I always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front teeth.\" II Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor, a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in. A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at Tremaine. \"We're closed,\" he said. \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the Bram property changed hands last.\" The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram? He dead?\" \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\" The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\" \"I want to know when he bought.\" The man hesitated, closed his"}

Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw. A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly. \"See what I can do,\" he said. It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a line written in faded ink: \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&V consid. NW Quarter Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 & cet.)\" \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine. \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\" \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to the door. \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of trouble?\" \"No. No trouble.\" The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\" he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\" \"I guess you're right.\" The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\" \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\" \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look. \"There's one story that's not superstition....\" Tremaine waited. \"You—uh—paying anything for information?\" \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob. The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway—I can swear to this. Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LONG_REMEMBERED_THUNDER_5#0", "contents": "Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint. \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The older are there in the shelves.\" \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\" The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle these old papers carefully.\" \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed through it, muttering. \"What date was it you wanted?\" \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\" The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table, adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\" \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech. Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly. On page four, under a column headed County Notes he saw the name Bram: Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land, north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past months. \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\" The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught his eye: A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along the river. The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now. You'll have to come back tomorrow.\" Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel. A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped short, stared after the car. \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply. Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed north after the police car."}

The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back. The door opened. A tall figure stepped out. \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled. \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\" \"What's it to you, mister?\" \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\" \"We could be.\" \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\" \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike before handing it to Tremaine. The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef, Tremaine?\" \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave the word, Grammond.\" \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out on me.\" \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\" Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it apart brick by brick in the time—\" \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll go underground.\" \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use for the spade work, that it?\" \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\" \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county—\" \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\" Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LONG_REMEMBERED_THUNDER_7#0", "contents": "Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call. \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred. Tell him if he queers this—\" \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out—\" \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia moonshiners.\" \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\" \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat and left the hotel. He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned face looked at him coolly. \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I—\" \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto. Only a faint quaver reflected her age—close to eighty, Tremaine thought, startled. \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said. \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a straight chair across the room from him. \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see that you've amounted to something.\" \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\" \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\" \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\" \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll. \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your discretion?\" \"Of course.\" \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LONG_REMEMBERED_THUNDER_8#0", "contents": "Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be used against him?\" \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs to be in the national interest.\" \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means, James. I distrust these glib phrases.\" \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\" \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the year.\" \"What does he do for a living?\" \"I have no idea.\" \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated piece of country? What's his story?\" \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\" \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his last?\" \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\" \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything—\" A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away impatiently. \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\" Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\" Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\" She paused. Tremaine waited. \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale. He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in a cave beneath his house.\" Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me there alone. \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried to speak to me but I would not listen. \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home. He never called again.\" \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\" Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I am, James.\" \"May I see it?\" She handed the locket to him.

It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\" Miss Carroll nodded. \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\" \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\" \"Bram fears the thunder.\" III As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and asked: \"Any luck, Jimmy?\" Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a dud, I'm afraid.\" \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\" \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\" As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand from what you were saying to me.\" \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\" \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring working—\" \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ... and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\" The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\" He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a gun?\" \"In the car.\" \"Better get it.\" Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket, rejoined Jess inside the house.

It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate lay on the oilcloth-covered table. \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\" \"Not a very cozy—\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the distance. \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\" A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\" Tremaine said. Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor. \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains. \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\" \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor. It ended suddenly near the wall. \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\" A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\" he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing tricks?\" \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few questions.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LONG_REMEMBERED_THUNDER_9#0", "contents": "At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop of greased hair. \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\" \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong with burnin out a Commie, is there?\" \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that out, Hull?\" \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we heard....\" \"What did you hear?\" \"They're lookin for the spies.\" \"Who's looking for spies?\" \"Cops.\" \"Who says so?\" The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said. \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all night.\" \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around hers.\" \"And you mentioned Bram?\" The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out that way, ain't he?\" \"Anything else?\" The boy looked at his feet."}

He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too—too— He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his neck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter, gaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a grunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions triumphantly. \"There! How do you like that ?\" Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always languid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem concerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned insultingly and forced a shudder. \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\" \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty. What do you think of it, Padre?\" \"Salvation\" Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black, a lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his weathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. \"Well, my boy,\" he admitted, \"there is some Biblical precedent for your—ahem!—clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat which was of many colors—'\" \"Both of you,\" declared Chip, \"give me a pain in the pants! Stick-in-the-muds!

Nice lucentite Dome ... good atmo ... a fine artificial grav system based on Terra normal. It seemed to be a popular little fueling-stop, too, for its cradle-bins were laden with vessels from every planet in the System, and as he gained the main drag he found himself rubbing shoulders with citizens of every known world. Lumbering, albino Venusians, petal-headed Martians, Jovian runts, greenies from far Uranus, Earthman—all were here. Quite a likely place, he thought happily, to chuck a brawl. A brilliantly gleaming xenon sign before him welcomed visitors to: XU'UL'S SOLAREST Barroom—Casino—Dancing 100—Lovely Hostesses—100 He entered, and was immediately deluged by a bevy of charm-gals vying for the privilege of: (1) helping him beat the roulette wheel; (2) helping him drink the house dry, and/or (3) separating him as swiftly as possible from the credits in his money belt. Chip shook them off, gently but firmly. He wanted a good time, true; but he wanted it solo. The main cabaret was too crowded; he passed through it and another equally blatant room wherein twoscore Venusians were straining the structure with a native \"sing-stomp,\" and ended up finally, with a sigh of relief, in a small, dimly-lighted private bar unfrequented by anyone save a bored and listless Martian bartender. The chrysanthemum-pated son of the desertland roused himself as Chip entered, rustled his petals and piped a ready greeting. \"Welcoom, ssirr! Trrink, pleasse?\" This was more like it! Chip grinned. \"Scotch,\" he said. \" Old Spaceman. And let's have a new bottle, Curly. None of that doctored swill.\" \"Of courrsse, ssirr!\" piped the bar-keep aggrievedly. He pushed a bottle across the mahogany; Chip flipped a golden credit-token back at him. \"Tell me when I've guzzled this, and I'll start work on another.\" He took a deep, appreciative sniff. \"And don't let any of those dizzy dolls in here,\" he ordered. \"I've got a lot of back drinking to catch up on, and I don't want to be disturbed— Hey! \" In his alarm, he almost dropped the bottle. For the door suddenly burst open, and in its frame loomed a figure in Space Patrol blues. A finger pointed in Chip's direction and a bull-o'-Bashan voice roared: \" Stop! Bartender—grab that man! He's a desperate criminal, wanted on four planets for murder!\""}

With a bleat of panic fear he scampered from his post, his metallic stilts clattering off in the distance. Chip's accuser moved forward from the shadows; dim light illumined his features. And— \" Johnny! \" Chip's voice lifted in a note of jubilant surprise. \"Johnny Haldane—you old scoundrel! Where in the void did you drop from?\" The S.S.P. man chuckled and returned Chip's greeting with a bone-grinding handclasp. \"I might ask the same of you, chum! Lord, it's been ages since we've crossed 'jectory! When I saw you meandering across the Casino, you could have knocked me down with a jetblast! What's new? Is old Syd still with you?\" \"We're still shipmates. But he's back at the spaceport. The jerry-crew is plating our crate with ek, and—\" \"Ek! Plating a private cruiser!\" Haldane stared at him in astonishment, then whistled. \"Sweet Sacred Stars, you must be filthy with credits to be able to coat an entire ship with ekalastron!\" \"You,\" boasted Chip, \"ain't heard nothing yet!\" And he told him how they had discovered an entire mountain of the previous new element, No. 97 in the periodic table, on frigid Titania, satellite of far Uranus. \"It was touch-and-go for a while,\" he admitted, \"whether we'd be the luckiest three guys in space—or the deadest! But we passed through the flaming caverns like old Shadrach in the Bible—remember?—and here we are!\" [1] Haldane was exuberant. \"A mountain of ekalastron!\" he gloated. \"That's the greatest contribution to spaceflight since Biggs' velocity-intensifier!\" It was no overstatement. \"Element No. 97 was a metal so light that a man could carry in one hand enough to coat the entire hull of a battleship—yet so adamant that a gossamer film of it would deflect a meteor! A metal strong enough to crush diamonds to ash—but so resilient that, when properly treated, it would rebound like rubber! What are you going to do with it, Chip? Put it on the open market?\" Warren shook his head. \"Not exactly. We talked it over carefully—Syd and Salvation and I—and we decided there are some space-rats to whom it shouldn't be made available. Privateers and outlaws, you know. So we turned control of the mines over to the Space Patrol at Uranus, and visiphoned the Earth authorities we were bringing in one cargo—\" \"Visiphoned!\" interrupted Haldane sharply. \"Did you say visiphoned?\" \"Why—why, yes.\" \"From where?\" \"Oh, just before we reached the Belt. We don't have a very strong transmitter, you know. Sa-a-ay, what's all the excitement, pal? Did we do something that was wrong?\" Haldane frowned worriedly. \"I don't know, Chip. It wasn't anything wrong , but what you did was damned dangerous. For if your message was intercepted, you may have played into the very hands of—the Lorelei!\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_LORELEI_DEATH_4#0", "contents": "Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned. \"Hey—I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here with an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I thought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a myth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in the middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks, warbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\" He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this alleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad story.\" He started to sing. \"' Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten —'\" The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him. \"It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's how she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures space-mariners to their death. \"The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in the Belt—and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising her vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since then, no less than a dozen spacecraft—freighters, liners, even one Patrolship—have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been brutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\" \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her if the crews have been murdered?\" \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and setting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her hideout—wherever it is—for empty hulks. One of these ships was salvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her pirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He described her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate glimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!\" Chip said soberly, \"So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I thought you were pulling my leg. Where do I come into this mess, though?\" \"Ekalastron!\" grunted Johnny succinctly. \"A jackpot prize for any corsair! And you advertised a cargo of it over the etherwaves! The Lorelei will be waiting for you with her tongue hanging out. The only thing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you can get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy—\" A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer would have groaned to see—for it usually presaged trouble. It was a bright, hard, reckless light. \"Hold your jets, Johnny!\" drawled Chip. \"Aren't you forgetting one thing? In a couple more hours, I can face the Lorelei and her whole mob—and be damned to them! She can't touch the Chickadee , because it's being plated right now!\" Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance. \"By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the Chickadee's hull like hail off a tin roof. Chip, are you in any hurry to reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we"}

I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's men put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him out somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that way— Chip! Look out! \""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LORELEI_DEATH_5#0", "contents": "Haldane shouted and moved at the same time. His arm lashed out wildly, thrusting, smashing Chip to the floor in a sprawling heap. The as-yet unopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand shards against a wall. Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head to see what had caused Johnny's alarm. Even as he did so, the dull gloom of the bar was blazoned with searing effulgence. A lancet of flame leaped from the dark, rearward doorway, burst in Johnny Haldane's face! The Patrolman cried once, a choking cry that died in a mewling whimper. His unused pistol slipped from slackening fingers, and he sagged to the floor. Again crimson lightning laced the shadows; Haldane's body jerked, and the air was raw with the hot, sickening stench of charred flesh. With an instinct born of bitter years, Chip had come to his knees behind the shelter of the mahogany bar. But now his own flame-pistol was in his hand, and a dreadful rage was mingled with the agony in his heart. Reckless of results, he sprang to his feet, gun spewing livid death into the shadows. His blast found a mark. For an instant flame haloed a human face drawn in inhuman pain. A heavy, sultry, bestial face, already puckered with one long, ugly scar that ran from right temple to jawbone, now newly scarred with the red brand of Chip's marksmanship. Then, before Chip could fire again, came the rasp of pounding footsteps. The man turned and fled. Chip bent over his fallen friend, seeking, with hands that did not even feel the heat, fluttering life beneath still smoldering cloth. He felt—nothing. Johnny was dead. A snarl of sheer animal rage burst from Chip's lips. Someone would pay for this; pay dearly! Help was coming now. He himself would lead the hue-and-cry that would track a foul murderer to his lair. He spun as the footsteps drew nearer. \"Hurry!\" he cried. \"This way! Follow me—\" In a bound, he hurdled the bar, lingered at the door only long enough to let the others mark his course. For they had burst into the room, now, a full score of them. Excited, hard-bitten dogs of space, quick-triggered and willing. Once more he cried for help. \"After him! Come on! He—\" And then—disaster struck! For a reedy voice broke from the van of the mob. The voice of the Martian bartender. \"That's him!\" he piped sibilantly. \"That's the man! He's a desperate criminal, wanted on four planets for murder! The Patrolman came to arrest him— and now he's murdered the Spacie !\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_LORELEI_DEATH_6#0", "contents": "II The stunning injustice of that accusation came close to costing Chip Warren his life. For a split second he stood motionless in the doorway, gaping lips forming denial. Words which were never to be uttered, for suddenly a raw-boned miner wrenched a Moeller from its holster, leveled and fired. The hot tongue of death licked hungrily at the young spaceman's cheek, scorched air crackled in his eardrums. Now was no time to squander in vain argument. Chip ducked, spun, and hurled himself through the doorway. There still remained one hope. That he might catch the real murderer, and in that way clear himself.... But the door led to a small, deserted vestibule, and it to an alleyway behind Xu'ul's Solarest. Viewing that maze of byways and passages, Chip knew his hope was futile. There remained but one thing to do. Get out of here. But quick! It was no hard task. The labyrinth swallowed him as it had engulfed the scarred killer; in a few minutes even the footsteps of his pursuers could no longer be heard. And Chip worked his cautious way back to the spaceport, and to the bin wherein was cradled the Chickadee . Syd Palmer looked up in surprise as Chip let himself in the electro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, \"Salvation, look what the cat drug in! His high-flying Nibs! What's the matter, Chip? Night-life too much for you?\" \"Never mind that now!\" panted Chip. \"Is this tin can ready to roll? Warm the hypos. We're lifting gravs—\" Palmer said anxiously, \"Now, wait a minute! The men haven't quite finished plating the hull, Chip!\" \"Can't help that! We've got important business. In a very few minutes— Ahh! There he goes now!\" Chip had gone to the perilens the moment he entered the ship; now he saw in its reflector that which he had expected. The gushing orange spume of a spaceship roaring from its cradle. \"Hurry, Syd!\" There were a lot of things Syd Palmer wanted to ask. He wanted to know who went where ; he was bursting with curiosity about the \"important business\" which had brought his pal back from town in such a rush; his keen eye also had detected a needle-gun burn on Chip's coat-sleeve. But he was too good a companion to waste time now on such trivia. \"O.Q.,\" he snapped. \"It's your pigeon!\" And he disappeared. They heard his voice calling to the workmen, the scuff of equipment being disengaged from the Chickadee's hull, the thin, high whine of warming hypatomics. Salvation looked at Warren quizzically. \"It smells,\" he ventured gently, \"like trouble.\" \"It is trouble,\" Chip told him. \"Plenty trouble!\" \"In that case—\" said the old man mildly—\"I guess I'd better get the rotor stripped for action.\" He stepped to the gunnery turret, dropped the fore-irons and stripped their weapon for action. \"'Be ye men of peace,'\" he intoned, \"'but gird firmly thy loins for righteous battle!'

And with a gusty roar the Chickadee rocketed into space on a pillar of flame."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LORELEI_DEATH_7#0", "contents": "Two hours later, Chip was still following the bright pinpoint of scarlet which marked the course of his quarry. In the time that had elapsed since their take-off, he had told his friends the whole story. When he told about the Lorelei, Salvation Smith's seamy old features screwed up in a perplexed grimace. \"A woman pirate in the Belt, son? I find it hard to believe. Yet—\" And when he described the death of Johnny Haldane, anger smoldered in the missionary's eyes, and Syd Palmer's hands knotted into tight, white fists. Said Syd, \"A man with a scar, eh? Well, we'll catch him sooner or later. And when we do—\" His tone boded no good to the man who had slain an old and loved friend. \"As a matter of fact,\" offered Salvation, \"we've got him now. Any time you say the word, Chip. We're faster than he is. We can close in on him in five minutes.\" \"I know,\" nodded Warren grimly. \"But we won't do it—yet. I'm borrowing a bit of Johnny's strategy. I've been plotting his course. As soon as I'm sure of his destination, we'll take care of him . But our first and most vital problem is to locate the Lorelei's hideaway.\" Syd said, \"That's all right with me, chum. I like a good scrap as much as the next guy. Better, maybe. But this isn't our concern, strictly speaking. What we ought to do is report this matter to the Space Patrol, let them take care of it.\" Salvation shook his head. \"That's where you're mistaken, Sydney. This is very much our concern. So much so, in fact, that we dare not make port again until it's cleared up. I think you have forgotten that it is not the scar-faced man who is wanted for the killing of Haldane—but Chip!\" \"B-but—\" gasped Palmer—\"b-but that's ridiculous! Chip and Johnny were old buddies. Lifelong friends!\" \"Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence indicates Chip's guilt. Twenty men saw him standing over Johnny's dead body, with a flame-pistol in his hand. And the barkeep heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip and accuse him of murder!\" Chip said ruefully, \"That's right, Syd. It was only a joke, but it backfired. The bartender thought Johnny meant it. He scooted out of there like a bat out of Hades. I'm in it up to my neck unless we can bring back evidence that Scarface actually did the killing. And that may not be so easy.\" He stirred restlessly. \"But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now our job is to keep this rat in sight. We've gone farther already than I expected we would.\" He turned to the old preacher. \"Where do you think we're going, Padre? Out of the Belt entirely?\" \"I've been wondering that myself, son. I don't know for sure, of course, but it looks to me as if we're going for the Bog. If so, you'd better keep a weather-eye peeled.\" \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before, but he knew of the Bog by"}

If so, you'd better keep a weather-eye peeled.\" \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before, but he knew of the Bog by hearsay. All men did. A treacherous region of tightly packed asteroids, a mad and whirling scramble of the gigantic rocks which, aeons ago, had been a planet. Few spacemen dared penetrate the Bog. Of those who did dare, few returned to tell the tale. \"The Bog! Say! I'd better keep a sharp lookout!\" He turned to the perilens once more, fastened an eye to its lens. And then— \"Syd!\" he cried. \"Salvation! Look! She—she—!\" He pressed the plunger that transferred the perilens image to the central viewscreen. And as he did so, a phantom filled the area which should have revealed yawning space, gay with the spangles of a myriad glowing orbs. The vision of an unbelievably beautiful girl, the golden-crowned embodiment of a man's fondest dreaming, eyes wide with an indistinguishable emotion, arms stretched wide in mute appeal. And from the throats of all came simultaneous recognition. \" The Lorelei! \""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LORELEI_DEATH_8#0", "contents": "At the same moment came a plea from the enchantress of space through a second medium. For no reason anyone could explain, the ship's telaudio wakened to life; over it came to their ears the actual words of the girl: \" Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me? Help —\" Even though he knew this to be only a ruse, a deliberate, dastardly trap set for the unwary, Chip Warren's pulse leaped in hot response to that desperate plea. Even with the warning of Johnny Haldane fresh in his memory, some gallantry deep within him spurred him to the aid of this lovely vision. Here was a woman a man could live for, fight for, die for! A woman like no other in the universe. Then common sense came to his rescue. He wrenched his gaze from the tempting shadow, cried: \"Kill that wavelength! Tune the lens on another beam, Syd!\" Palmer, bedazzled but obedient, spun the dial of the perilens . Despite his vastly improved science Man had never yet succeeded in devising a transparent medium through which to view the void wherein he soared; the perilens was a device which translated impinging light-waves into a picture of that which lay outside the ship's hull. When or where electrical disturbances existed in space, its frequency could be changed for greater clarity. This was what Syd now attempted. But to no avail! For it mattered not which cycle he tuned to—the image persisted. Still on the viewscreen that pleading figure beckoned piteously. And still the cabin rang to the prayers of that heart-tugging voice: \" Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me? Help —\" Gone, now, was any fascination that thrilling vision might previously have held for Chip Warren. Understanding of their plight dawned coldly upon him, and his brow became dark with anger. \" We're blanketed! Flying blind! Salvation, radio a general alarm! Syd, jazz the hypos to max. Shift trajectory to fourteen-oh-three North and loft ... fire No. 3 jet....\" He had hurled himself into the bucket-shaped pilot's seat; now his fingers played the controls like those of a mad organist. The Chickadee groaned from prow to stern, trembled like a tortured thing as he thrust it into a rising spiral. It was a desperate chance he was taking. Increasing his speed thus, it was certain he would be spotted by the man he had been following; the flaming jets of the Chickadee must form a crimson arch against black space visible for hundreds—thousands!—of miles. Nor was there any way of knowing what lay in the path Chip thus blindly chose. Titanic death might loom on every side. But they had to fight clear of this spot of blindness, clear their instruments.... And then it came! A jarring concussion that smashed against the prow of the Chickadee like a battering ram. Chip flew headlong out of his bucket to spreadeagle on the heaving iron floor. He heard, above the grinding plaint of shattered steel the bellowing prayer of Salvation Smith: \"We've crashed! 'Into Thy hands, O Lord of old—'\" Then"}

He's smashed us with a tractor-blast!\" Chip stared at his companion numbly. \"But—but that's impossible! We're plated with ek! A tractor-cannon couldn't hurt us—\" \" Half-plated! \" howled Syd savagely. \"And those damn fools started working from the stern of the Chickadee ! We're vulnerable up front, and that's where he got us! In a minute this can will be leaking like a sieve. I'll get out bulgers. Hold 'er to her course, Chip!\" He dove for the lockers wherein were hung the space-suits, tore them hastily from their hangers. Chip again spun the perilens vernier. No good! No space ... no stars ... just a beautiful phantom crying them to certain doom. By now he was aware that from a dozen sprung plates air was seeping, but he fought down despair. While there remained hope, a man had to keep on fighting. He scrambled back into the bucket-seat, experimented with controls that answered sluggishly. Salvation had sprung to the rotor-gun, was now angrily jerking its lanyard, lacing the void with death-dealing bursts that had no mark. The old man's eyes were brands of fire, his white hair clung wetly to his forehead. His rage was terrible to behold. \"'Yes, truly shall I destroy them!'\" he cried, \"'who loose their stealth upon me like a thief from the night—'\" Then suddenly there came a second and more frightful blow. The straining Chickadee stopped as though pole-axed by a gigantic fist. Stopped and shuddered and screamed in metal agony. This time inertia flung Chip headlong, helpless, into the control racks. Brazen studs took the impact of his body; crushing pain banded about his temples, and a red wetness ran into his eyes, blurring and blinding him, burning. For an instant there flamed before him a universe of incandescent stars, weaving, shimmering, merging. The vision of a woman whose hair was a golden glory.... After that—nothing!"}

Nearer and nearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrums with booming savagery. \"—coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out—\" Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situation in which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the Chickadee , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. He lay on the parched, rocky soil of a—a something. A planetoid, perhaps. And he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all the planets that circle the Sun.... Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. The chase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength, born of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head. \"My—my companions?\" he demanded weakly. The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive of shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw, raven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk, loosed a satisfied grunt. \"Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!\" Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip—but he managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelm him, and confronted the big man boldly. \"What,\" he stormed, \"is the meaning of this?\" The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then his raven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawed in boisterous mirth. \"Hear that?\" he roared to his companions. \"Quite a guy, ain't he? 'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?\" Then he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in his eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. His tone assumed a biting edge. \"The meanin' is, my bucko,\" he answered mirthlessly, \"that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you have a sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast and straight!\" \"Talk?\" \"Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nice haul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way.\" The burly one chuckled coarsely. \"We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped matters out by comin' to us.\" Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend's ominous warning. \"—if your message was intercepted, you may have played into the hands of—\" He said slowly, \"Then you are the Lorelei's men?\" \"The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron—where did it come from?\" And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man did hold the whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most important secret of all!

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories May 1954. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Evil luck brought the meteorite to those particular space-time coordinates as Number Four rode the downhill spiral toward Venus. The football-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a relative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close enough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the idling drivers. It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was dragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy of motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused themselves to the nonmetallic tube casing. In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular driver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent searing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment before the main circuit breakers could clack open. The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering a delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see again soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started aft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly that Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers. Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet room door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was manipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One by one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence. The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable conditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open. Quickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was close behind him. Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony, hung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had lost its usual ruddiness. Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in the zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The line accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter glasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared minor. They had been lucky. \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said meaningfully. Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two hours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to order his crew into action. It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite Hind's shouted orders. At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to the control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he threw in the accelerator switch. The meter needles climbed, soared past the red"}

Hind made a final check, floated over to the control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he threw in the accelerator switch. The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing, and just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power. \" There's metal in the field! \" His voice was high and unsteady."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_2#0", "contents": "Everyone knew what that meant. The slightest trace of magnetic material would distort the delicately balanced cylinder of force that contained and directed the Hoskins blast, making it suicidal to operate. Calmly Captain Reno voiced the thought in every mind. \"It must be cleared. From the outside.\" Several of the men swore under their breaths. Interplanetary space was constantly bombarded, with an intensity inverse to the prevailing gravitation, by something called Sigma radiation. Man had never encountered it until leaving Earth, and little was known of it except that short exposure killed test animals and left their bodies unpredictably altered. Inside the ship it was safe enough, for the sleek hull was charged with a Kendall power-shield, impervious to nearly any Sigma concentration. But the shielding devices in the emergency spacesuits were small and had never been space-tested in a region of nearly equalized gravitations. The man who emerged from the airlock would be flipping a coin with a particularly unpleasant form of death. Many pairs of eyes turned toward Robson Hind. He was jet chief. \"I'm assigned, not expendable,\" he protested hastily. \"If there were more trouble later....\" His face was pasty. Assigned. That was the key word. Barry Barr felt a lump tightening in his stomach as the eyes shifted to him. He had some training in Hoskins drivers. He knew alloys and power tools. And he was riding Four unassigned after that broken ankle had made him miss Three. He was the logical man. \"For the safety of the ship.\" That phrase, taken from the ancient Earthbound code of the sea, had occurred repeatedly in the indoctrination manual at Training Base. He remembered it, and remembered further the contingent plans regarding assigned and unassigned personnel. For a moment he stood indecisively, the nervous, unhumorous smile quirking across his angular face making him look more like an untried boy than a structural engineer who had fought his way up through some of the toughest tropical construction camps of Earth. His lean body, built more for quick, neatly coordinated action than brute power, balanced handily in the zero gravity as he ran one hand through his sandy hair in a gesture of uncertainty. He knew that not even the captain would order him through the airlock. But the members of the Five Ship Plan had been selected in part for a sense of responsibility. \"Nick, will you help me button up?\" he asked with forced calmness. For an instant he thought he detected a sly gleam in Hind's eyes. But then the jet chief was pressing forward with the others to shake his hand. Rebellious reluctance flared briefly in Barry's mind. Dorothy Voorhees had refused to make a definite promise before blasting off in Three—in fact he hadn't even seen her during her last few days on Earth. But still he felt he had the inside track despite Hind's money and the brash assurance that went with it. But if Hind only were to reach Venus alive—"}

His spacesuit trapped and amplified breathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitation to blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of the insidiously deadly Sigma radiations. Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotch against the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, started cutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task requiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on the events that had brought him here. First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma for the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was perfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been inherently poor. Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step—to Mars. But men had found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that had shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt. Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been well within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round trip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible. But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government and various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled to within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by specialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien conditions. On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to whichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition. That one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with colonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell. Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the experts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions, he had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus Colony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form was most needed—most particularly a launching ramp—and to study native Venusian materials. Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the limited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to rely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle delayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian materials to suit Earth tastes and digestions. Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of loneliness had come to an end. She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual despite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment of first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed emotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone, and been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded devotion to his work.

He too had come up the hard way, alone, and been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded devotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his insistence, her aloofness had begun to melt. But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the business manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried a considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to virtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires. The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened to her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly expensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some factor in his personality that had made her hesitate. Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of rivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and had made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have himself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed. But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with a fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship. He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by inch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but enough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into stuttering action. Then it was done. As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to start according to calculations."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_4#0", "contents": "Barry opened his eyes. The ship was in normal deceleration and Nick Podtiaguine was watching him from a nearby bunk. \"I could eat a cow with the smallpox,\" Barry declared. Nick grinned. \"No doubt. You slept around the clock and more. Nice job of work out there.\" Barry unhitched his straps and sat up. \"Say,\" he asked anxiously. \"What's haywire with the air?\" Nick looked startled. \"Nothing. Everything checked out when I came off watch a few minutes ago.\" Barry shrugged. \"Probably just me. Guess I'll go see if I can mooch a handout.\" He found himself a hero. The cook was ready to turn the galley inside out while a radio engineer and an entomologist hovered near to wait on him. But he couldn't enjoy the meal. The sensations of heat and dryness he had noticed on awakening grew steadily worse. It became difficult to breathe. He started to rise, and abruptly the room swirled and darkened around him. Even as he sank into unconsciousness he knew the answer. The suit's Kendall-shield had leaked! Four plunged toward Venus tail first, the Hoskins jets flaring ahead. The single doctor for the Colony had gone out in Two and the crewmen trained in first aid could do little to relieve Barry's distress. Fainting spells alternated with fever and delirium and an unquenchable thirst. His breathing became increasingly difficult. A few thousand miles out Four picked up a microbeam. A feeling of exultation surged through the ship as Captain Reno passed the word, for the beam meant that some Earthmen were alive upon Venus. They were not necessarily diving straight toward oblivion. Barry, sick as he was, felt the thrill of the unknown world that lay ahead. Into a miles-thick layer of opacity Four roared, with Captain Reno himself jockeying throttles to keep it balanced on its self-created support of flame. \"You're almost in,\" a voice chanted into his headphones through crackling, sizzling static. \"Easy toward spherical one-thirty. Hold it! Lower. Lower. CUT YOUR POWER!\" The heavy hull dropped sickeningly, struck with a mushy thud, settled, steadied. Barry was weak, but with Nick Podtiaguine steadying him he was waiting with the others when Captain Reno gave the last order. \"Airlock open. Both doors.\" Venusian air poured in. \"For this I left Panama?\" one of the men yelped. \"Enough to gag a maggot,\" another agreed with hand to nose. It was like mid-summer noon in a tropical mangrove swamp, hot and unbearably humid and overpowering with the stench of decaying vegetation. But Barry took one deep breath, then another. The stabbing needles in his chest blunted, and the choking band around his throat loosened. The outer door swung wide. He blinked, and a shift in the encompassing vapors gave him his first sight of a world bathed in subdued light. Four had landed in a marsh with the midships lock only a few feet above a quagmire surface still steaming from the final rocket blast.

He blinked, and a shift in the encompassing vapors gave him his first sight of a world bathed in subdued light. Four had landed in a marsh with the midships lock only a few feet above a quagmire surface still steaming from the final rocket blast. Nearby the identical hulls of Two and Three stood upright in the mud. The mist shifted again and beyond the swamp he could see the low, rounded outlines of the collapsible buildings Two and Three had carried in their cargo pits. They were set on a rock ledge rising a few feet out of the marsh. The Colony! Men were tossing sections of lattice duckboard out upon the swamp, extending a narrow walkway toward Four's airlock, and within a few minutes the new arrivals were scrambling down. Barry paid little attention to the noisy greetings and excited talk. Impatiently he trotted toward the rock ledge, searching for one particular figure among the men and women who waited. \"Dorothy!\" he said fervently. Then his arms were around her and she was responding to his kiss. Then unexpected pain tore at his chest. Her lovely face took on an expression of fright even as it wavered and grew dim. The last thing he saw was Robson Hind looming beside her. By the glow of an overhead tubelight he recognized the kindly, deeply lined features of the man bending over him. Dr. Carl Jensen, specialist in tropical diseases. He tried to sit up but the doctor laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. \"Water!\" Barry croaked. The doctor held out a glass. Then his eyes widened incredulously as his patient deliberately drew in a breath while drinking, sucking water directly into his lungs. \"Doctor,\" he asked, keeping his voice low to spare his throat. \"What are my chances? On the level.\" Dr. Jensen shook his head thoughtfully. \"There's not a thing—not a damned solitary thing—I can do. It's something new to medical science.\" Barry lay still. \"Your body is undergoing certain radical changes,\" the doctor continued, \"and you know as much—more about your condition than I do. If a normal person who took water into his lungs that way didn't die of a coughing spasm, congestive pneumonia would get him sure. But it seems to give you relief.\" Barry scratched his neck, where a thickened, darkening patch on each side itched infuriatingly. \"What are these changes?\" he asked. \"What's this?\" \"Those things seem to be—\" the doctor began hesitantly. \"Damn it, I know it sounds crazy but they're rudimentary gills.\" Barry accepted the outrageous statement unemotionally. He was beyond shock. \"But there must be—\" Pain struck again, so intense his body twisted and arched involuntarily. Then the prick of a needle brought merciful oblivion.

II Barry's mind was working furiously. The changes the Sigma radiations had inflicted upon his body might reverse themselves spontaneously, Dr. Jensen had mentioned during a second visit—but for that to happen he must remain alive. That meant easing all possible strains. When the doctor came in again Barry asked him to find Nick Podtiaguine. Within a few minutes the mechanic appeared. \"Cheez, it's good to see you, Barry,\" he began. \"Stuff it,\" the sick man interrupted. \"I want favors. Can do?\" Nick nodded vigorously. \"First cut that air conditioner and get the window open.\" Nick stared as though he were demented, but obeyed, unbolting the heavy plastic window panel and lifting it aside. He made a face at the damp, malodorous Venusian air but to Barry it brought relief. It was not enough, but it indicated he was on the right track. And he was not an engineer for nothing. \"Got a pencil?\" he asked. He drew only a rough sketch, for Nick was far too competent to need detailed drawings. \"Think you can get materials?\" Nick glanced at the sketch. \"Hell, man, for you I can get anything the Colony has. You saved Four and everybody knows it.\" \"Two days?\" Nick looked insulted. He was back in eight hours, and with him came a dozen helpers. A power line and water tube were run through the metal partition to the corridor, connections were made, and the machine Barry had sketched was ready. Nick flipped the switch. The thing whined shrilly. From a fanshaped nozzle came innumerable droplets of water, droplets of colloidal size that hung in the air and only slowly coalesced into larger drops that fell toward the metal floor. Barry nodded, a smile beginning to spread across his drawn features. \"Perfect. Now put the window back.\" Outside lay the unknown world of Venus, and an open, unguarded window might invite disaster. A few hours later Dr. Jensen found his patient in a normal sleep. The room was warm and the air was so filled with water-mist it was almost liquid. Coalescing drops dripped from the walls and curving ceiling and furniture, from the half clad body of the sleeping man, and the scavenger pump made greedy gulping sounds as it removed excess water from the floor. The doctor shook his head as he backed out, his clothes clinging wet from the short exposure. It was abnormal. But so was Barry Barr. With breathing no longer a continuous agony Barry began to recover some of his strength. But for several days much of his time was spent in sleep and Dorothy Voorhees haunted his dreams.

Whenever he closed his eyes he could see her as clearly as though she were with him—her face with the exotic high cheek-bones—her eyes a deep gray in fascinating contrast to her raven hair—lips that seemed to promise more of giving than she had ever allowed herself to fulfil—her incongruously pert, humorous little nose that was a legacy from some venturesome Irishman—her slender yet firmly lithe body. After a few days Dr. Jensen permitted him to have visitors. They came in a steady stream, the people from Four and men he had not seen since Training Base days, and although none could endure his semi-liquid atmosphere more than a few minutes at a time Barry enjoyed their visits. But the person for whom he waited most anxiously did not arrive. At each knock Barry's heart would leap, and each time he settled back with a sigh of disappointment. Days passed and still Dorothy did not come to him. He could not go to her, and stubborn pride kept him from even inquiring. All the while he was aware of Robson Hind's presence in the Colony, and only weakness kept him from pacing his room like a caged animal. Through his window he could see nothing but the gradual brightening and darkening of the enveloping fog as the slow 82-hour Venusian day progressed, but from his visitors' words he learned something of Venusian conditions and the story of the Colony. Number One had bumbled in on visual, the pilot depending on the smeary images of infra-sight goggles. An inviting grassy plain had proved to be a layer of algae floating on quicksand. Frantically the crew had blasted down huge balsa-like marsh trees, cutting up the trunks with flame guns to make crude rafts. They had performed fantastic feats of strength and endurance but managed to salvage only half their equipment before the shining nose of One had vanished in the gurgling ooze. Lost in a steaming, stinking marsh teeming with alien creatures that slithered and crawled and swam and flew, blinded by the eternal fog, the crew had proved the rightness of their choice as pioneers. For weeks they had floundered across the deadly terrain until at last, beside a stagnant-looking slough that drained sluggishly into a warm, almost tideless sea a mile away, they had discovered an outcropping of rock. It was the only solid ground they had encountered. One man had died, his swamp suit pierced by a poisonous thorn, but the others had hand-hauled the radio beacon piece by piece and set it up in time to guide Two to a safe landing. Houses had been assembled, the secondary power units of the spaceship put to work, and the colony had established a tenuous foothold. Three had landed beside Two a few months later, bringing"}

Houses had been assembled, the secondary power units of the spaceship put to work, and the colony had established a tenuous foothold. Three had landed beside Two a few months later, bringing reinforcements, but the day-by-day demands of the little colony's struggle for survival had so far been too pressing to permit extended or detailed explorations. Venus remained a planet of unsolved mysteries. The helicopter brought out in Three had made several flights which by radar and sound reflection had placed vague outlines on the blank maps. The surface appeared to be half water, with land masses mainly jungle-covered swamp broken by a few rocky ledges, but landings away from base had been judged too hazardous. Test borings from the ledge had located traces of oil and radioactive minerals, while enough Venusian plants had proven edible to provide an adequate though monotonous food source. Venus was the diametric opposite of lifeless Mars. Through the fog gigantic insects hummed and buzzed like lost airplanes, but fortunately they were harmless and timid. In the swamps wildly improbable life forms grew and reproduced and fought and died, and many of those most harmless in appearance possessed surprisingly venomous characteristics. The jungle had been flamed away in a huge circle around the colony to minimize the chances of surprise by anything that might attack, but the blasting was an almost continuous process. The plants of Venus grew with a vigor approaching fury. Most spectacular of the Venusian creatures were the amphibious armored monsters, saurian or semi-saurians with a slight resemblance to the brontosauri that had once lived on Earth, massive swamp-dwellers that used the slough beside the colony's ledge as a highway. They were apparently vegetarians, but thorough stupidity in tremendous bulk made them dangerous. One had damaged a building by blundering against it, and since then the colony had remained alert, using weapons to repel the beasts. The most important question—that of the presence or absence of intelligent, civilized Venusians—remained unanswered. Some of the men reported a disquieting feeling of being watched, particularly when near open water, but others argued that any intelligent creatures would have established contact."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_5#0", "contents": "Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had done to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into membranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and dark parallel lines appeared. But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not stopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had to believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the weird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still he was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's failure to visit him did not help his mental condition. Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming. Dorothy was leaning over him. \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you do have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all that seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in her eyes. \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\" \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted off—oh, the most piteous letter!\" Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child. I've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned. \"I—think—I—know—who—wrote—that—letter!\" he declared grimly. \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt in her voice. Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly. \"I believe you, Barry.\" She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days at Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of civilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had awakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a woman, as well as a toxicologist. When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous and confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger simmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging Robson Hind's features. The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but this time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had made Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had carried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or judiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook some undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the Five Ship Plan. But even with his trickery Hind had lost. He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom. The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead tubelight was off. He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest. Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist machine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead, cut off outside his room. Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air would be dry, and he would be choking and strangling.

Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air would be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call for help. The door was locked! He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had been removed. He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal doorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was efficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to bounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped. Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair and swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again. A small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under continued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning strength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered. He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden Venusian air poured in—but it was not enough! He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed sprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused rustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of approaching unconsciousness. There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched forward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground. Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of colored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth habits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath. Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung slack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his life since the moment of birth forced him to inhale. Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze of the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the brackish, silt-clouded water. III Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became aware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew instinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock the meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from all other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony were separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless void between Earth and Venus. Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened his eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something burrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat worm between his fingers.

He was wearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to congregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his eyelids. For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in increasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and burrowed, and blindly he began to swim. Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and kept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one the worms dropped off. He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on a faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier here, and clearer. He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn back, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he could not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of direction. He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to underwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of hands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and ceased. He sank. Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory system completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At last he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless. Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a gasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving toward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a figure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat. One figure drifted limply bottomward. Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from the group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet moved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the Earthman. Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the sticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder. Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung in a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to ineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking and clawing. Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted the attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to the creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working. Human—or nearly so—the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and webbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more for ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face was coarse and savage.

A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more for ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face was coarse and savage. It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched a short tube from its belt. Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as he flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the water and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something zipped past his head, uncomfortably close. Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone. He struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp. Barry stared through the reddening water. Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's spear from the mud and raised it defensively. But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled desperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his spear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the other was upon her from behind. One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender body backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the bottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help secure her arms and legs with lengths of cord. One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at her brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the dead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were loot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic necklace the girl wore but it did not break. He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear. The girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out. Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear ready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously. Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His own lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each other's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the inside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman arched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature gasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in its belly. The other one turned too late as Barry leaped. Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone."}

We try never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\" \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\" \"Certainly not on Groac.\" Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before you close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim disapproval as he closed the door."}

The deep regret of the Archivist.\" \"The importance of my task here,\" Retief said, enunciating the glottal dialect with difficulty. \"My interest in local history.\" \"The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.\" \"The necessity that I enter.\" \"The specific instructions of the Archivist.\" The Groacian's voice rose to a whisper. \"To insist no longer. To give up this idea!\" \"OK, Skinny, I know when I'm licked,\" Retief said in Terran. \"To keep your nose clean.\" Outside, Retief stood for a moment looking across at the deeply carved windowless stucco facades lining the street, then started off in the direction of the Terrestrial Consulate General. The few Groacians on the street eyed him furtively, veered to avoid him as he passed. Flimsy high-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement. The air was clean and cool. At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of complaints. Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street. An elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the Groacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in. A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from the bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in mid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot. \"To enjoy a cooling drink,\" Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at the edge of the pit. \"To sample a true Groacian beverage.\" \"To not enjoy my poor offerings,\" the Groacian mumbled. \"A pain in the digestive sacs; to express regret.\" \"To not worry,\" Retief said, irritated. \"To pour it out and let me decide whether I like it.\" \"To be grappled in by peace-keepers for poisoning of—foreigners.\" The barkeep looked around for support, found none. The Groaci customers, eyes elsewhere, were drifting away. \"To get the lead out,\" Retief said, placing a thick gold-piece in the dish provided. \"To shake a tentacle.\" \"The procuring of a cage,\" a thin voice called from the sidelines. \"The displaying of a freak.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MADMAN_FROM_EARTH_4#0", "contents": "Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture of contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the creature was drunk. \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes toward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\" \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk whispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered toward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\" \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly. \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The barkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk, took his arms and helped him to the door. \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own stinking place.\" \"I've changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful as hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the door. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked at the weaving alien. \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered. \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\" \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\" \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum with you.\" \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\" \"To have a drink together—\" \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief. Retief backed away. \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy—\" The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him, head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow crossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local, who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow alley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following Groacian. Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian fell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose; Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed. \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay right here and have a nice long talk.\" II \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There are two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\" \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his cape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign Ministry.\" \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind telling you.\" \"I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\" Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments indicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a courteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right. \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Consul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present Shluh, of the Internal Police?\" \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said.

Miss Meuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair. \"Oh, it's such a pleasure—\" she began. \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn't come here to sip tea today.\" \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report, Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police chief. \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought to hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this individual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department indicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of the Terrestrial Consul.\" Miss Meuhl gasped audibly. \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific , which dropped from sight in this sector nine years ago?\" \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands—\" \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped. \"I'll not be a party—\" \"You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I'm telling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\" Miss Meuhl sat down. Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound, Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial hands—\" \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but it hits a sour note with me.\" \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible episode! And you—\" \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac and sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny answers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left. Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe—at the most. If they were innocent.\" \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out. \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest your—\""}

He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to it.\" Fith rose; Shluh followed suit. \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for your diplomatic immunity, I should do more—\" \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force paid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial diplomatic mission.\" \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice. \"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It has outdone itself—\" \"—to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief said. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've visaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the diplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or your satellite—\" \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of this matter—\" \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do the talking,\" Retief said. \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped. Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The Groaci sat down. \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years back—about nine, I think—there was a little parade held here. Some curious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged, they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the streets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show. \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to communicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit. \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the parade was over?\""}

Miss Meuhl opened her mouth, closed it and blinked rapidly. \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their throats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure out for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them yell....\" \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at once.\" \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple narco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the parade.\" \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there was no killing.\" \"They're alive?\" \"Alas, no. They ... died.\" Miss Meuhl yelped faintly. \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\" \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what foods—\" \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\" \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\" \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want more information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship? What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the big parade?\" \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\" \"Killed in the crash landing?\" \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ... Terrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were strange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\" \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\" \"Guns? No, no guns—\" \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them; helped them to death.\" \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned. \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking for them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a brisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close call, eh?\" \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the strange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we felt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships came, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our guilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our friendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made a blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make amends....\" \"Where is the ship?\" \"The ship?\" \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget. Where is it?\" The two Groacians exchanged looks. \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the ship.\" \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don't come back in a reasonable length of time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He stood, looked at the Groaci. \"Let's go,\" he said."}

He peered into the gloom at the curving flank of the space-burned hull. \"Any lights in here?\" he asked. A Groacian threw a switch. A weak bluish glow sprang up. Retief walked along the raised wooden catwalk, studying the ship. Empty emplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was visible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy. \"How did you get it in here?\" Retief asked. \"It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,\" Fith said, his voice thinner than ever. \"This is a natural crevasse. The vessel was lowered into it and roofed over.\" \"How did you shield it so the detectors didn't pick it up?\" \"All here is high-grade iron ore,\" Fith said, waving a member. \"Great veins of almost pure metal.\" Retief grunted. \"Let's go inside.\" Shluh came forward with a hand-lamp. The party entered the ship. Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior of the control compartment. Dust was thick on the deck, the stanchions where acceleration couches had been mounted, the empty instrument panels, the litter of sheared bolts, scraps of wire and paper. A thin frosting of rust dulled the exposed metal where cutting torches had sliced away heavy shielding. There was a faint odor of stale bedding. \"The cargo compartment—\" Shluh began. \"I've seen enough,\" Retief said. Silently, the Groacians led the way back out through the tunnel and into the late afternoon sunshine. As they climbed the slope to the steam car, Fith came to Retief's side. \"Indeed, I hope that this will be the end of this unfortunate affair,\" he said. \"Now that all has been fully and honestly shown—\" \"You can skip all that,\" Retief said. \"You're nine years late. The crew was still alive when the task force called, I imagine. You killed them—or let them die—rather than take the chance of admitting what you'd done.\" \"We were at fault,\" Fith said abjectly. \"Now we wish only friendship.\" \"The Terrific was a heavy cruiser, about twenty thousand tons.\" Retief looked grimly at the slender Foreign Office official. \"Where is she, Fith? I won't settle for a hundred-ton lifeboat.\""}

His throat vibrated rapidly as he struggled for calm. \"My government can entertain no further accusations, Mr. Consul,\" he said at last. \"I have been completely candid with you, I have overlooked your probing into matters not properly within your sphere of responsibility. My patience is at an end.\" \"Where is that ship?\" Retief rapped out. \"You never learn, do you? You're still convinced you can hide the whole thing and forget it. I'm telling you you can't.\" \"We return to the city now,\" Fith said. \"I can do no more.\" \"You can and you will, Fith,\" Retief said. \"I intend to get to the truth of this matter.\" Fith spoke to Shluh in rapid Groacian. The police chief gestured to his four armed constables. They moved to ring Retief in. Retief eyed Fith. \"Don't try it,\" he said. \"You'll just get yourself in deeper.\" Fith clacked his mandibles angrily, eye stalks canted aggressively toward the Terrestrial. \"Out of deference to your diplomatic status, Terrestrial, I shall ignore your insulting remarks,\" Fith said in his reedy voice. \"Let us now return to the city.\" Retief looked at the four policemen. \"I see your point,\" he said. Fith followed him into the car, sat rigidly at the far end of the seat. \"I advise you to remain very close to your consulate,\" Fith said. \"I advise you to dismiss these fancies from your mind, and to enjoy the cultural aspects of life at Groac. Especially, I should not venture out of the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to the Groacian government.\" In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung vehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to the rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing. III \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, \"I want you to listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off guard.\" \"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,\" Miss Meuhl snapped, her eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses. \"If you'll listen, you may find out,\" Retief said. \"I have no time to waste, Miss Meuhl. They won't be expecting an immediate move—I hope—and that may give me the latitude I need.\" \"You're still determined to make an issue of that incident!\" Miss Meuhl snorted. \"I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a sophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.\" \"You're ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it's not what happened nine years ago I'm concerned with. It's what's happening now. I've told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out. Don't you understand the implication? That vessel couldn't have come far.

The logical next move for the Groaci is to dispose of both of us. We're the only ones who know what happened. Fith almost did the job this afternoon, but I bluffed him out—for the moment.\" Miss Meuhl emitted a shrill laugh. \"Your fantasies are getting the better of you,\" she gasped. \"In danger, indeed! Disposing of me! I've never heard anything so ridiculous.\" \"Stay in this office. Close and safe-lock the door. You've got food and water in the dispenser.

What's happened to your clothing?\" \"I got a little dirty. Don't worry about it.\" Retief went to his desk, opened a drawer and replaced the needler. \"Where have you been?\" Miss Meuhl demanded. \"I stayed here—\" \"I'm glad you did,\" Retief said. \"I hope you piled up a supply of food and water from the dispenser, too.

Listen, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief went on earnestly, \"I've found the missing cruiser.\" \"You heard him relieve you!\" \"I heard him say he was going to, Miss Meuhl.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] No one, least of all Martin, could dispute that a man's life should be guarded by his kin—but by those who hadn't been born yet? Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of soldiers—enemies and allies, both—that had engulfed the country in successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble that way. Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell him to call her \" Aunt Ninian \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little too crazy for that. He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry instead of mopping up the floor with him. \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin Conrad?\" \"Because he's coming to kill you.\" \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\" Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it. You wouldn't understand.\" \"You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in straight gas?\" \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_2#0", "contents": "So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to think it was disgusting. \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested. She looked at him as if he were out of his mind. \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered. And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in the streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew how to give them the cold shoulder. One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so hard inside. But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and hired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him. Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo. \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical application to go by,\" she told him. He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a spectator. When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again, Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites. \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\" And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle Raymond. From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many more—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_3#0", "contents": "Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she was supposed to know better than he did. He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before, warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by more luxury than he knew what to do with. The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time and a freezer well stocked with food—somewhat erratically chosen, for Ninian didn't know much about meals. The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back. Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd nearly killed him—but then there had also been times when she'd hugged and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society. From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness. They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him, in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than actually doing anything with the hands. In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands; everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of normal living. It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth. They came from the future."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_4#0", "contents": "When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had promised five years before. \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste. Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun, and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having carefully eradicated all current vulgarities. \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond continued. \"Which is distressing—though, of course, it's not as if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about passing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that, and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However, Conrad is so impatient.\" \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested. \"I've told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all. But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\" He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food. All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how would they manage to live?\" \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the past and think in the future. \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but if you will persist in these childish interruptions—\" \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said. But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more frightening—his race had lost something vital. Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him, Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for the fact that our great-grandfather"}

Which is ridiculous—his feeling guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held accountable for his great-grandfather.\" \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_5#0", "contents": "Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this or don't you?\" \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it. \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally officious—always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\" Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas' assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way, there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines. \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed. Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the adolescent way,\" he said, \"to do away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole society in order to root out a single injustice?\" \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\" \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea of eliminating our great-grandfather—because our great-grandfather was such a good man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of his great-grandfather's father—who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty worthless character.\" \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly. Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us—the other cousins and me—held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He beamed at Martin. The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in eliminating me, then none of you would exist, would you?\" Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the cousins possessed to a consternating degree."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_6#0", "contents": "Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise. \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered, \"and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\" Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the use of the iron maiden. \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here we are!\" \"I see,\" Martin said. Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don't see what more you could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our era has completely disposed of the mercantiles—\" \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked. But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge, we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale. Ostentation—that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are, the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this wretched historical stint.\" \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for him. \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\" \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference. Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him, you know.\" Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to protect me when he comes?\" \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no doubt,"}

But still he was dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this house , but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this time ?\" \"Never fear—it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory guarantee and all that.\" \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have one of those guns, too.\" \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that myself!\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_7#0", "contents": "When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the very last. Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his descendants were exceedingly inept planners. Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques, carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise, Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—\"architecturally dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously typical\"—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level aquarium. \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to go with a castle.\" \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused. \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place seem safer somehow.\" The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it, until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them. During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of entertainment."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_8#0", "contents": "\"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because, unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one just—well, drifts along happily.\" \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\" \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you made up your mind what you want to be?\" Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice. \"Or perhaps an engineer.\" There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly. \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen. Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\" \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though, to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\" \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\" \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked. \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly. Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of their times.\" \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\" Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that other time?\" There was a chilly silence. \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be thankful we've saved you from that !\" So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was fear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for the sake of an ideal. But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty pictures."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_9#0", "contents": "Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants cousin —next assumed guardianship. Ives took his responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not interested. \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\" Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a change of air and scenery. \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it. Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\" So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht, which Martin christened The Interregnum . They traveled about from sea to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more. The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters, largely because they could spend so much time far away from the contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through time. More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard ship, giving each other parties and playing an avant-garde form of shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of having got advance information about the results. Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_10#0", "contents": "He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue of their distinguished ancestry. \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked. Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development. Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been deported. \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected himself. \"Maybe it is worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more. Bombed. Very thorough job.\" \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested, even. \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the people—I expect you could call them people—there. Still—\" he smiled shamefacedly—\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed, could I?\" \"I suppose not,\" Martin said. \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except Conrad, and even he—\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything, if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin. \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he couldn't even seem to care. During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement. But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking.... He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to take a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.

After a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell apart as the different oceans. All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust their elders. As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port for fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that era than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore, and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes that his other work lacked. When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way, he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the cousin's utter disgust. \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you do,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were scraping bottom now—advised. Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored. However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer understand. \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked the current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now. The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time—waiting until we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!\" \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said. He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one conversation, anyhow. \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\" Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant.

There was a war in the south and they hid out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel and man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates."}

He was a hundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when the family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no hope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life. All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to their progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and Raymond—all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed, spilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the deck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed. Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had been spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young people—all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed never to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see relief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their responsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal pity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so irretrievably. There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't a strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in the looking glass when he was a young man. \"You must be Conrad,\" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that was still clear. \"I've been looking forward to meeting you for some time.\" The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer. \"You're too late, Con,\" Raymond gloated for the whole generation. \"He's lived out his life.\" \"But he hasn't lived out his life,\" Conrad contradicted. \"He's lived out the life you created for him. And for yourselves, too.\" For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his lineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there. \"Don't you realize even yet,\" Conrad went on, \"that as soon as he goes, you'll go, too—present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up in the air like puffs of smoke?\" \"What do you mean?\" Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed. Martin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up to him. It was his show, after all. \"Because you will never have existed,\" Conrad said. \"You have no right to existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time, so he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married, have children ....\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_13#0", "contents": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through. \"I knew from the very beginning,\" Conrad finished, \"that I didn't have to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroy yourselves.\" \"I don't understand,\" Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of the cousins closest to him. \"What does he mean, we have never existed? We're here, aren't we? What—\" \"Shut up!\" Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. \"You don't seem surprised.\" The old man grinned. \"I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.\" At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better to throw them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? He had decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him—to watch and wait and keep out of things—and that was the role he would play. \"You knew all the time and you didn't tell us!\" Raymond spluttered. \"After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead of a criminal.... That's right,\" he snarled, \"a criminal! An alcoholic, a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?\" \"Sounds like a rich, full life,\" Martin said wistfully. What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, he couldn't help thinking, he—he and Conrad together, of course—had done them out of any kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility, though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course was destined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the better course, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt inside him. Strange—where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly have developed such a queer thing as a conscience? \"Then we've wasted all this time,\" Ninian sobbed, \"all this energy, all this money, for nothing!\" \"But you were nothing to begin with,\" Martin told them. And then, after a pause, he added, \"I only wish I could be sure there had been some purpose to this.\" He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight, or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growing shadowy. \"I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you be wiped out of existence,\" he went on voicing his thoughts. \"But I know that the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world will happen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It's bound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.\" One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he told himself. Two men, that was—one real, one a shadow. Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent. \"No,\" he said, \"there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitter works two ways. I used it for going into the past only once—just this once. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And—\" he pressed Martin's hand—\"believe me, what I did—what we did, you and I—serves a purpose."}

More than that, was he trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right thing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all right. Was Conrad actually different from the rest? His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had consisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ... nothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they had stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses? \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I have fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal.\" Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to blame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other men's future—other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and, since he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury him. The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to many legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth."}

For Click and Irish were marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a damned sweet picture of everything that was happening. The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console, wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this meteor coming like blazing fury. Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's skin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round. There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now. It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs. Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of metal death. What a fade-out! \"Irish!\" he heard himself say. \"Is this IT?\" \"Is this what ?\" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet. \"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?\" Marnagan fumed. \"I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!\" They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones. The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled around—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst, air and energy flung out. Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like this one! His brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his camera."}

Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the wreckage into that silence. He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there, thinking \"Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—\" A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck. \"Hold it!\" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera whirred. \"Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!\" \"From the toe of me boot!\" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders flexed inside his vac-suit. \"I might've died in there, and you nursin' that film-contraption!\" Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. \"I never thought of that. Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to.\" Hathaway stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down, pale. \"Where are we?\" \"A million miles from nobody.\" They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars. Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look sick. \"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking hands the other side of this rock in two hours.\" Marnagan shook his mop of dusty red hair. \"And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd capture that Gunther lad!\" His voice stopped and the silence spoke. Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. \"I checked my oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.\" The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or was suffocation a better death...? Sixty minutes. They stood and looked at one another. \"Damn that meteor!\" said Marnagan, hotly. Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out: \"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot. Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've got it here, on film.\" Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. \"It's not proof we need now, Click. Oxygen. And then food . And then some way back to Earth.\" Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: \"This is Gunther's work. He's here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.

There wasn't much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting. Marnagan said, \"We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about it. As for me—\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is me hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\" Click nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish. It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and the crash this way.\" Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far down, and the green eyes blazed. They stopped, together. \"Oops!\" Click said. \"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel that ?\" Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and limbless, suddenly. \"Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\" They ran back. \"Let's try it again.\" They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened. \"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\" \"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No wonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up! Gunther'd do anything to—did I say anything ?\" Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with numerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them. Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt the creatures at all. \"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline toward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\" Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're too big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out, as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him. Instinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a scene!\" \"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\" \"Use your gun.\" \"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase, eh, Click?\" \"Yeah. Sure. You enjoyed it, every moment of it.\" \"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what will we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?\" \"Let me think—\" \"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\""}

Something about these monsters and Gunther and— \"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a blue one?\" Hathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God, now you've got me doing it. Joking in the face of death.\" \"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\" That didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed out. Marnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take me a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\" Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\" \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our rescue!\" Hathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\" Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he said. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped, my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace negotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\" Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals. Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling for the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts. When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him: \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So, what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory is lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men? Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around. It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\" Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\" \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them.\" Hathaway nodded at the beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals tend to them.

Holding it up, he stripped it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical, leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the impressions. Quick stuff. Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base, Click handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\" Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah, Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\" \"Huh?\" \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid monsters complete.\" \"What!\" Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again: Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally with nothing ; Marnagan shooting his gun at nothing ; Marnagan pretending to be happy in front of nothing . Then, closeup—of—NOTHING! The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it. Maybe— Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this mess! Here—\" He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film, the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the monsters weren't there, they weren't there. \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave—\" \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click. Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or infra-red or something that won't come out on film?\" \"Nuts! Any color we see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\" \"Hey, where you going?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man tried pushing past him. \"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway. Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere, it'll be me does the going.\" \"I can't let you do that, Irish.\" \"Why not?\" \"You'd be going on my say-so.\" \"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\" \"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—\" \"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their bones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist except under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me profile a scan.

As long as we believed in them they could have frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If that isn't being dangerous—\" The Irishman whistled. \"But, we've got to move , Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen. In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source, Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters.\" Click attached his camera to his mid-belt. \"Gunther probably thinks we're dead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never had a chance to disbelieve them.\" \"If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—\" \"Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—\" Click stopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and felt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady himself, and swayed. \"I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours. This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.\" Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. \"Hold tight, Click. The guy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.\" \"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals came from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come back!\" \"Come back? How?\" \"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we believe in them again, they'll return.\" Marnagan didn't like it. \"Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if we believe in 'em?\" Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. \"Not if we believe in them to a certain point . Psychologically they can both be seen and felt. We only want to see them coming at us again.\" \" Do we, now?\" \"With twenty minutes left, maybe less—\" \"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back.

They're pretty.\" The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on. Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily. \"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead, draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then, you show up with your gun....\" \"I haven't got one.\" \"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They probably got scanners out. Let them see me—\" And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved up, and there was a door opening in the rock. His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\" Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring. Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast. \"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different radio. One of Gunther's guards. Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed. The strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that gun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off. How'd you get past the animals?\" Click started running. He switched off his sending audio, kept his receiving on. Marnagan, weaponless. One guard. Click gasped. Things were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running and listening to Marnagan's lying voice: \"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in"}

{"chunk_id": "The_Monster_Maker_8#0", "contents": "The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn! A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked, air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let you stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther wanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\" Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him. \"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind you! Freeze!\" The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped his gun to the floor. \"Get his gun, Irish.\" Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward. Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for posing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid acting.\" \"What!\" \"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door leading into the Base?\" The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder. Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air. \"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double time! Double!\" Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard, hid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish tersely. They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing more than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged. Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't wanted. They were scared off. The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius. \"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled Irish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\" \"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool the engineers who created them, you nut.\" Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come riding over the hill—\""}

I want a complete picture of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an actor are you?\" \"That's a silly question.\" \"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\" \"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\" An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets, lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a wide, green-lawned Plaza. Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters. He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back. He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and pushed him into a room where Gunther sat. Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken, questioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he could speak, Hathaway said: \"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men against your eighty-five.\" Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands twitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm directness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\" \"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\" \"Impossible!\" \"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\" A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side of his office. He stared, hard. The Patrol was coming! Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol. Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis guns with them in their tight hands. Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air. \"Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\" Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run,"}

Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway had to credit them on that. They took it, standing. Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was. His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state. Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and twitch. God, what photography! Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight. Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos taking place immediately outside his window. The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And out of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\""}

How did we do?\" \"Fine, Irish. Fine!\" \"So here's Gunther, the spalpeen! Gunther, the little dried up pirate, eh?\" Marnagan whacked Hathaway on the back. \"I'll have to hand it to you, this is the best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I was to fight with such splendid men as these—\" He gestured toward the Plaza. Click laughed with him. \"You should be proud. Five hundred Patrolmen with hair like red banners flying, with thick Irish brogues and broad shoulders and freckles and blue eyes and a body as tall as your stories!\" Marnagan roared. \"I always said, I said—if ever there could be an army of Marnagans, we could lick the whole damn uneeverse! Did you photograph it, Click?\" \"I did.\" Hathaway tapped his camera happily. \"Ah, then, won't that be a scoop for you, boy? Money from the Patrol so they can use the film as instruction in Classes and money from Cosmic Films for the news-reel headlines! And what a scene, and what acting! Five hundred duplicates of Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically into the minds of the pirates, walking across a Plaza, capturing the whole she-bang! How did you like my death-scenes?\" \"You're a ham. And anyway—five hundred duplicates, nothing!\" said Click. He ripped the film-spool from the camera, spread it in the air to develop, inserted it in the micro-viewer. \"Have a look—\" Marnagan looked. \"Ah, now. Ah, now,\" he said over and over. \"There's the Plaza, and there's Gunther's men fighting and then they're turning and running. And what are they running from? One man! Me. Irish Marnagan! Walking all by myself across the lawn, paralyzing them. One against a hundred, and the cowards running from me! \"Sure, Click, this is better than I thought. I forgot that the film wouldn't register telepathic emanations, them other Marnagans. It makes it look like I'm a mighty brave man, does it not? It does. Ah, look—look at me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute of it, I am.\""}

We're a combination, we two, we are. I take it all back about your pictures, Click, if you hadn't thought of taking pictures of me and inserting it into those telepath machines we'd be dead ducks now. Well—here I go....\" Hathaway stopped him. \"Hold it. Until I load my camera again.\" Irish grinned. \"Hurry it up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed. I think I'll handle them with me fists for a change. The gentle art of uppercuts. Are you ready, Hathaway?\" \"Ready.\" Marnagan lifted his big ham-fists. The camera whirred. Hathaway chuckled, to himself. What a sweet fade-out this was!"}

One that attacked only people within the political borders of the United States! Illustrated by Schoenherr Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the excited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody had to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip. Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been answering the rare call on the single line—in that friendly, husky voice that gave even generals pause—by saying, \"Good morning. Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now there was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to a dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And now the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\" All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office deep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite comprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or at least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy McCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin. \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel Patterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe this replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the brand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in charge.\" \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious epidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack timed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top of the whole powder keg.\" Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment before he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop of hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\" he said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I know what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority, we'll try to figure this thing out.\" \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so irregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word. \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through. \"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the sergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other officers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they drifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top priority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could panic at any moment. You've got to come through.\" Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general, snubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will you bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of his be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves.

She gave him a motherly smile as she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said. \"Brass give you much trouble?\" \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick, brown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to his wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\" \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a little time.\" \"Thanks. Sit down.\" She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no fatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's spreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her dark eyes. \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked. \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,—and a bunch more. No indication there. Except\"—she fished out a one-page report—\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign for everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today they were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at the polls. They've all got it.\" Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's a big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up with a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\" \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so far, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers, teachers, preachers—rich, poor—from Florida to Alaska. Just when you called me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated mountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too fragmentary.\" \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly ill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until they have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of the country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\" \"In food?\" \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing plants over the country. How could they all goof at the same time—even if it was sabotage?\" \"On the wind?\" \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire country—even Alaska and Hawaii—without hitting Canada or Mexico? And why wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\" Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to grip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ... well, an enemy?\" \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\" For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her, punishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his head, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of papers. \"We've got to find a clue—a trend—an inkling of something.\" He nodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those girls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country. Have them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up another relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and sandwiches. And on"}

You and I'll start with Washington.\" Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode from the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on the phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone and directory. He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to worried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical nurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible scrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned down to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and broken lines pointed vaguely to trends."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_PLAGUE_3#0", "contents": "It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with another stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a cigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean cried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers. \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office. Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who trailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his jaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an instant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of General Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a swagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded newspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk. \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first glance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ warfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\" Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll help a lot,\" he growled hoarsely. \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face, but tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the pale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the situation.\" Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips. Bettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on his shoulder. \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\" A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report to—\" \"All right,\" Andy said sharply. For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled slowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said, \"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some of the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're surviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that makes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt Bettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her a tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say what you came here to say and let us get back to work.\" \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual, \"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions. Your conduct here will be noted and—\" \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's shoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight around when this man—\" \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would co-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a bit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to get these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant. Corporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will report to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\" Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her"}

And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the sergeant and his staff alone.\" \"But, general, I—\" The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his chair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face. \"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\" Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many things. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\" The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled up a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face as he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had feared.\" Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A captain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him. \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had a report—nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the civilian newspapermen—not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a day and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had—it was a coded message the Reds'd tried to censor—was an indication of something big in the works.\" \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had an epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\" \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that they could cripple us from within.\" The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out effort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every serviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've still got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're right ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\" Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through muffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there, futility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm. He heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement that silenced him. Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll find your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\" The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then launched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and your captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the duration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the sergeant and the corporal here.\" \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned—\" The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated—unless you find a two-star general to outrank me.

He fancied a tiny lever in his brain and he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper channel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile of reports Bettijean had brought in. She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used, studying the names he had crossed off. \"Did you learn anything?\" she asked. Andy coughed, trying to clear his raw throat. \"It's crazy,\" he said. \"From the Senate and House on down, I haven't found a single government worker sick.\" \"I found a few,\" she said. \"Over in a Virginia hospital.\" \"But I did find,\" Andy said, flipping through pages of his own scrawl, \"a society matron and her social secretary, a whole flock of office workers—business, not government—and new parents and newly engaged girls and....\" He shrugged. \"Did you notice anything significant about those office workers?\" Andy nodded. \"I was going to ask you the same, since I was just guessing. I hadn't had time to check it out.\" \"Well, I checked some. Practically none of my victims came from big offices, either business or industry. They were all out of one and two-girl offices or small businesses.\" \"That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor, dentist or attorney?\" \"Nor a single postal worker.\" Andy tried to smile. \"One thing we do know. It's not a communicable thing. Thank heaven for—\" He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before both Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her teeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out. Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. \"This may be something. Half the adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\" \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same thing—only not quite as severe—in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\" \"Writers?\" \"Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the hard hit.\" \"This is insane,\" Andy muttered. \"Doctors and dentists are fine—writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.\" Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. \"Here's a country doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about. Nobody's sick in his valley.\" \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his cigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all lumped together.\" \"What does it show?\" \"Black-out. By order of somebody higher up—no medical releases. Must mean they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin. \"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the first hit?\" \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not.

{"chunk_id": "THE_PLAGUE_5#1", "contents": "they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin. \"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the first hit?\" \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not. The brass could keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could slap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come from the general public.\" \"Here's another batch,\" Andy said. \"Small college towns under twenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.\" \"Well, it's not split intellectually. Small colleges and small offices and writers get it. Doctors don't and dentists don't. But we can't tell who's got it on the military bases.\" \"And it's not geographical. Look, remember those two reports from Tennessee? That place where they voted on water bonds or something, everybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't even heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head. Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the outer office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a paper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and nibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk. Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of his cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily. \"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\" \"The answer?\" \"Of course. What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink or wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear? What do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists? What are we missing? What—\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_PLAGUE_6#0", "contents": "In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk, then a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed. Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to Bettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\" It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she lay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering, shivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the hall door, plainly ready to stampede. \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to cover her. And get a glass of water.\" The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the fallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used a chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a blanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of water and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\" \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\" She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared. Fever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\" \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling suddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside manner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked out with this stuff yet.\" Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed. \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that you did—everything you ate or drank—in the last ... oh, twelve hours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see Bettijean standing there. He tried to smile. \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly. Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take. One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged nearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of attention. Andy ignored her. \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\" Janis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\" Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then told about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying on her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about eleven when the relief crew came in.\" \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked. \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color spreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face away from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little nap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\" \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\" \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly. Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\" \"But ... but....\" \"Was it something against regulations?\" \"I ... I don't know. I think....\" \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\" \"Well....\" She"}

Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\" \"But ... but....\" \"Was it something against regulations?\" \"I ... I don't know. I think....\" \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\" \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance sought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally, resigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\" Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her about what we were doing here.\" Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes. \"Did you mail it?\" \"Y ... yes.\" \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\" \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob. \"Did I do wrong?\" \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's certainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it easy and—. Oh, here's a doctor now.\" The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A lab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only shrug and indicate the girl. Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of thoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society matrons, office workers—Aspen, Taos and college towns—thousands of people sick—but none in that valley in Tennessee—and few government workers—just one girl in his office—and she was sicker and more frightened about a letter—and.... \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled. Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's desk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it, straightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He snatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse. Ripping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through the pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab technician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\" The technician darted out. Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the general first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of everything.\" Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He was still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen other brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The lab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed his hastily scribbled report to Andy."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_PLAGUE_7#0", "contents": "It was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle silence. \"Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?\" Then she moved around the desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers. \"Have you got something?\" the brigadier asked. \"Some girl outside was babbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students, and little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a trend?\" Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was weary. \"Our problem,\" he said, \"was in figuring out what a writer does that a doctor doesn't—why girls from small offices were sick—and why senators and postal workers weren't—why college students caught the bug and people in a Tennessee community didn't. \"The lab report isn't complete. They haven't had time to isolate the poison and prescribe medication. But\"—he held up a four-cent stamp—\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\" The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes bugged at Andy, at the stamp. Bettijean said, \"Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents and especially writers and artists and poets—they'd all lick lots of stamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have postage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking. And\"—she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck—\"Andy, you're wonderful.\" \"The old American ingenuity,\" the colonel said, reaching for Andy's phone. \"I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do—\" \"At ease, colonel,\" the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the colonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. \"It's your show. What do you suggest?\" \"Get somebody—maybe even the President—on all radio and TV networks. Explain frankly about the four-centers and warn against licking any stamps. Then—\" He broke off as his phone rang. Answering, he listened for a moment, then hung up and said, \"But before the big announcement, get somebody checking on the security clearances at whatever plant it is where they print stamps. This's a big deal. Somebody may've been planted years ago for this operation. It shouldn't be too hard. \"But there's no evidence it was a plot yet. Could be pure accident—some chemical in the stickum spoiled. Do they keep the stickum in barrels? Find out who had access. And ... oh, the phone call. That was the lab. The antidote's simple and the cure should be quick. They can phone or broadcast the medical information to doctors. The man on the phone said they could start emptying hospitals in six hours. And maybe we should release some propaganda. \"United States whips mystery virus,\" or something like that. And we could send the Kremlin a stamp collection and.... Aw, you take it, sir. I'm pooped.\""}

Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling his granite brow. \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\" Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk lick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\" The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and the grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day furlough to rest up—or to get better acquainted?\" Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand. \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings I can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions, I'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to pin on the bars.\" But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of furlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the depths of each other's eyes. And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent stamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the stamp out of the office under guard. THE END"}

The old man with his thick neck, thick cigar, evening highball, potgut and bald head without a brain in it. His slim mother with nervously polite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailty that he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all, marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out. The old man said, \"He'll be okay. Let him alone.\" \"But he won't eat. Just lies there all the time.\" \"Hell,\" the old man said. \"Sixteen's a bad time. School over, waiting for the draft and all. He's in between. It's rough.\" Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly. \"We got to let him go, Eva. It's a dangerous time. You got to remember about all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere to go, like they say. You read the books.\" \"But he's unhappy.\" \"Are we specialists? That's the Youth Board's headache, ain't it? What do we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed or we'll be late.\" Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposeless noises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say. Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in the same old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all the way to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or with eyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retire into limbo. How come he'd been stuck with parental images like that? One thing—when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pants off Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he'd forget his punkie origins in teeveeland. But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressed impulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was no doubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion. So he'd waited in his room, and it wasn't easy sweating it out alone waiting for the breakout call from HQ. \"Well, dear, if you say so,\" Mother said, with the old resigned sigh that must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly. They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up. \"Relax,\" Wayne said. \"You're not going anywhere tonight.\" \"What, son?\" his old man said uneasily. \"Sure we are. We're going to the movies.\" He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn't answer.

The old man handed the keys over. His understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes. \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed the glaring wonders of escape."}

He strode under a sign reading Public Youth Center No. 947 and walked casually to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork. \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\" Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\" \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a pass, killer?\" \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\" \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to Captain Jack, room 307.\" \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory. A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne. Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid breaking out tonight?\" \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a cigarette. \"I've decided.\" The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement. \"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and you're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\" \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still a counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\" The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head ventilated, bud, and good.\" Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the shelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in a Skelly switchblade for kicks—the six-inch disguised job with the double springs.\" The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger, while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and scary. He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the elevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\" Captain Jack moved massively.

The big stone-walled office, alive with stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had a head shaped like a grinning bear. Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to shrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea among bowling balls. Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags. \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you? Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos. His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him, ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But that wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy, what was he doing holding down a desk? \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly collection.\" The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch from Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth. Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his passcard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make out.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West Side. Know where that is, punk?\" \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\" \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people. They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and they're your key to the stars.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack."}

Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The Olds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away. The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind. He turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale, secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells. Wayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with the shadows of mysterious promise. He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling. FOUR ACES CLUB He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass filtering through windows painted black. He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub balanced on one end. The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and doom. \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\" Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled. The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons. \"Help me, kid.\" He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and crouched as he began stalking the old rummy. \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand came up swinging a baseball bat. A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled. The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up. Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything. Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless, until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb.

He held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep. The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled up with stick arms over his rheumy face. The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling glass. \"Go, man!\" The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like bright wind-blown sparks. Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage. He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires."}

He spotted her red shirt and yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table. He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift. The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm. She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive. Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse heavy. \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked. \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card. \"Sure, teener.\" Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass. Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious cat's. Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little mouse. The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in the pay of the state. \"What else, teener?\" \"One thing. Fade.\" \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup. Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his veins, became hot wire twisting in his head. He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good. \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said. He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table crashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was out the door. Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release.

Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots. Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling, sliding down a brick shute. He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood."}

Wayne crept up. She gave a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked. He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling plaster, a whimpering whine. \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\" She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her, feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's shadow floated ahead. He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the jagged skylight. Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening to his creeping, implacable footfalls. Then he yelled and slammed open the door. Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior, shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the moon-streaming skylight. She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten cloth. \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\" \"What's that, baby?\" \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the difference.\" \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said. \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want—\" She began to cry. She cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth open. \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up. \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\" She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up at him. He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and shuffled away from her. He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees. \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh, God, I'm so tired waiting and running!\" \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat. \"Please.\" \"I can't, I can't!\" He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] When nobody aboard ship remembers where it's going, how can they tell when it has arrived? Every day for a week now, Rikud had come to the viewport to watch the great changeless sweep of space. He could not quite explain the feelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since the engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone, from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his life, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had grown. If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This disturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had realized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside him. Today, space looked somehow different. The stars—it was a meaningless concept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright pinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport—were not apparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead, there was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart by itself in the middle of the viewport. If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was odd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was—it was—what was it? Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and greeted gray-haired old Chuls. \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire children. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\" Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the health-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it; he just didn't, without comprehending. Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the time he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select as his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud ignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling he could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man had? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always embroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a headache? Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here and knew it was your time, too....\" His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not explain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had departed almost before Chuls knew of its existence. \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_2#0", "contents": "A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the health-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray tubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant tube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch the one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing larger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a metallic voice said. \"Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.\" Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy him. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when he wanted to do it? There was a strange thought, and Rikud's brain whirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and unsatisfactory answers. He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got hurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl himself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen. But something soft had cushioned the impact—something which had come into being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being again, something which was as impalpable as air. Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real authority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that there should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine in the library had told him of the elders—a meaningless term—who had governed the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but that was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only listened to the buzzer. And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said. There had been a revolt—again a term without any real meaning, a term that could have no reality outside of the reading machine—and the elders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people had decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and that it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They were born and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little cogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but he knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the people against the elders, and it said the people had won. Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he had to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the look of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down upon him, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations before Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of medicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old age, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud often thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the"}

But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old age, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud often thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future, not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only a decade to go. Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy through the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time Rikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True, this was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it proved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw Crifer limp. But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_3#0", "contents": "Now Crifer said, \"I've been reading again, Rikud.\" \"Yes?\" Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the smell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it meant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the library and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat about and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it. But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the people ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it was always the same. \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They're also called astronomy, I think.\" This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one elbow. \"What did you find out?\" \"That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.\" \"Well, where's the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow. \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under 'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous terms.\" \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are changing.\" \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he questioned what it might mean in this particular case. \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the others.\" \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud knew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he did. Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told them, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.\" \"I'm only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly. \"Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without meaning.\" \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested. A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and Chuls said, \"It's almost time for me to eat.\" Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two concepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago, but now it faded, and change and old were just two words. His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange feeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the viewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the world, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman. He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly remembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed; this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings—strange channelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions. He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the stars again."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_4#0", "contents": "The view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud's pulses leap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and where Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of light, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his eyes to look. Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to turn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed to control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white globe—if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There was that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age? Rikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's book on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was variable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age. Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer, and he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that he couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them. But the new view persisted. Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud had no name. A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green, and on the other, blue. Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular intervals by a sharp booming. Change— \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below. \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\" \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently. But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw—what he had always seen, except that now there was the added factor of change—perhaps did not exist in the viewport. Maybe it existed through the viewport. That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more confusing than ever. \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\" \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow. Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of vapor. \"What do you see?\" Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\" \"What else?\" \"Else? Nothing.\" Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do you"}

What do you hear?\" \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of the engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\" The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_5#0", "contents": "Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world. But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover, did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt. Rikud sat down hard. He blinked. The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_6#0", "contents": "For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept it as fact. There—through the viewport and in it—was a garden. A garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the world's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless, it was a garden. He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\" Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\" he admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\" Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking—the word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere was the garden and the world had arrived. \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants are different.\" \"Then they've changed?\" \"No, merely different.\" \"Well, what about the viewport? It changed. Where are the stars? Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\" \"The stars come out at night.\" \"So there is a change from day to night!\" \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\" \"Once they shone all the time.\" \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_7#0", "contents": "Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on astronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not, our whole perspective has changed.\" And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another, it was with a purpose—to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the health-rays. Now if the world had walked from—somewhere, through the vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could they find the nature of that purpose? \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery. Damn the man, all he did was eat! Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry. And Rikud, too, was hungry. Differently."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_8#0", "contents": "He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the door. \"What's in here?\" he demanded. \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer. \"I know, but what's beyond it?\" \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean through the door.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened it. It's only a door.\" \"I will,\" said Rikud. \"You will what?\" \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\" A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\" \"I think so.\" \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\" \"No—\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently, and Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\" Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across, Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine. He missed the beginning, but then: —therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may have discarded it for something better—who knows? But if you have not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is human-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not permit it—within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be permitted through this door— Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't. When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle humming, punctuated by a throb-throb-throb which sounded not unlike the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's eyes—he blinked and looked again, but it was still there—cogs and gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him. \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but no one quite seems to know its meaning.\" Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door. Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world."}

In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance. And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport. He began to turn the handle. Then he trembled. What would he do out in the garden? He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't. Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer. By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could walk and then might find himself in the garden. It was so big."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_9#0", "contents": "Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that book on astronomy. Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in the world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the women's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through that. But there are no others.\" Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by the world, there are two other doors!\" Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly. \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than Crifer, but had no lame foot. \"Doing what?\" \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.\" \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\" Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig. \"Why don't we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned. \"Well, I won't go,\" Chuls replied. \"There's no reason to go. If Rikud has been imagining things, why should I?\" \"I imagined nothing. I'll show you—\" \"You'll show me nothing because I won't go.\" Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at the blouse. \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_10#0", "contents": "Crifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what he's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.\" \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening. \"Only if you'll go with me.\" Rikud was panting. Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud holding Chuls' blouse. \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's shirt. Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each partner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done. A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls. Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\" In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it. What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing? This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it, though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he could huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_11#0", "contents": "Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears, would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he was clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again upon entering the room. He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that held it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he swung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding, crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled under his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm. Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not casual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud smashed everything in sight. When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room was a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first, but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in his ears because now the throbbing had stopped. He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality. Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once, when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone. Whimpering, he fled."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_12#0", "contents": "All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food. Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\" \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied confidently. \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said. \"What won't?\" \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\" Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad thing you did, Rikud.\" \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there beyond the viewport.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said. Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I think.\" There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I hate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it. Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat? Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better. \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\" \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully. Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\" \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\" \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.\" \"We must go outside—through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made. A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard Crifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile. Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud. The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face. \"I hit him! I hit him!\" Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There"}

Someone said, \"Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing hurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away. It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely and positively. He became sickly giddy thinking about it. But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him. He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library, through the inner door and into the room with the voice—but the voice didn't speak this time—through its door and into the place of machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage. Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet. He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness, it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to break him. Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life. The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people should . This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more. But he was afraid. He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head."}

He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head. Slowly he slipped to the cool floor—how his head was burning!—and for a long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he heard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on the metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest: \"There is Rikud on the floor!\" Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright. Something small and brown scurried across the other side of the viewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous red eyes. Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face was so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal which he could see in the dim light through the open door. \"Where's the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\" Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You broke it. And now we will break you—\" Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps came, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway. Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him. His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it be variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying brown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his stomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing could live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness, then so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others.... So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And his heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of his neck. He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the blue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row of mounds."}

{"chunk_id": "The_Sense_of_Wonder_13#0", "contents": "Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and someone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kicked out and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved the weight of his body with all his strength against the door. It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth. The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. He walked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel the floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the horizon. It was all very beautiful. Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across the land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when he got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the others followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the water to drink. Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was good. Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. \"Even feelings are variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.\" Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. \"People are variable, too, Crifer. That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.\" \"They're women,\" said Crifer. They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness. With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid. It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer, frightening doors and women by appointment only. Rikud felt at home."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_SERPENT_RIVER_3#0", "contents": "class=\"chap\"/> \"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the summit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a closer view of the strange thing we had come to see. It shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late afternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like something that crawled slowly over the planet's surface. There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It might have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain—or a chain of mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had shaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow tube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their skyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along the surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of solid substance. We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from this distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course for centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn path between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the horizon. What was it? \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers. Our sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good Will Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first expedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important pieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned) had brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts of the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this planet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and (2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land, continuously, endlessly. We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance from the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred not to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly vibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it proved to be some sort of vegetable—a vine of glacier proportions—or a river of some silvery, creamy substance—we would move in upon it gradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon \"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of split-hairs. Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment. I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn eagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare young Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse! \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\" \"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two, Order of Duties upon Landing: A—\" \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on"}

If I recall our Code, Section Two, Order of Duties upon Landing: A—\" \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See it?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from under its belly?\" \"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\" \"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\" \"No sir.\" \"Well, what about it? Any comments?\" Split answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with restraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir. Any orders, sir?\" \"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\" \"Thanks—thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though coming from him it was strained. His training had given him an exaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline. He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all, his scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his words even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he required in his coffee. Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits. Across the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled (our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I had sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim his fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually physically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the part. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"—and the wide ears that stuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of selfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I could rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken. Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused. \"What do you see?\" I asked. \"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the object I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny—\" \"You're seeing some sort of object?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"What sort of object?\" \"A living creature, sir—upright, wearing clothes—\" \"A man ?\" \"To all appearances, sir—\" \"You bounder, give me that telescope!\""}

If you have explored the weird life of many a planet, as I have, you can appreciate the deep sense of excitement that comes over me when, looking out at a new world for the first time, I see a man-like animal. Walking upright! Wearing adornments in the nature of clothing! I gazed, and my lungs filled with the breath of wonderment. A man! Across millions of miles of space—a man, like the men of the Earth. Six times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realms within the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had the living creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life of our Earth. A man! He might have been creeping on all fours. He might have been skulking like a lesser animal. He might have been entirely naked. He was none of these—and at the very first moment of viewing him I felt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance—but had my ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own race a million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life had somehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know? By what faded charts of the movements through the sky will man ever be able to retrace relationships of forms of life among planets? \"Get ready to go out and meet him, Campbell,\" I said. \"He's a friend.\" Split Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even know what sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly or murderous. \"There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take my word for it, he's a friend.\" \"I didn't say anything, sir.\" \"Good. Don't. Just get ready.\" \"We're going to go out —?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Orders.\" \"And meet both of them?\" Split was at the telescope. \"Both?\" I took the instrument from him. Both! \"Well!\" \"They seem to be coming out of the ground,\" Split said. \"I see no signs of habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground city—though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.\" \"One's a male and the other's a female,\" I said. \"Another hypothesis,\" said Split. The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two \"friends\". They were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our ship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently come up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied them through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a hike. The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might guess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold, cleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the cream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in the breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this"}

His skin was almost the color of the cream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in the breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this was matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a circular mantle. The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some sort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the setting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break in the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions, his moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening. The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back of her.... Three.... Four.... Five.... \"Where do they come from?\" Split had paused in the act of checking equipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I might not have made a discovery. The landscape was moving . The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a prominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I looked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving. They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the crowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees themselves were moving. \"Notice anything?\" I asked Split. \"The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.\" He gazed. \"They're coming from underground.\" Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of the moving trees. \"Notice anything else unusual?\" I persisted. \"Yes. The females—I'm speaking hypothetically—but they must be females—are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows. I wonder why?\" \"You haven't noticed the trees?\" \"The females are quite attractive,\" said Split. I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope. Mobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on other planets—\"sponge-trees\"—which possessed a sort of muscular quality. If these were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of the slope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paid no attention to them. I studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb. The others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. The lemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the males and the soft curves of the females. \"Those furry elbow ornaments on the females,\" I said to Split, \"they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, so they pad their elbows.\" \"Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on their shoulders.\" \"Are you complaining?\" We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we were"}

They don't have anything on their shoulders.\" \"Are you complaining?\" We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we were to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted their meeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowing that people from another world watched. The tall leader must be making a speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in calm, graceful gestures. \"They'd better break it up!\" Split said suddenly. \"The jungles are moving in on them.\" \"They're spellbound,\" I said. \"They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you ever see moving trees?\" Split said sharply, \"Those trees are marching! They're an army under cover. Look!\" I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for a sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as innocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edged with alarm. \"Captain! Those worshippers—how can we warn them? Oh-oh! Too late. Look!\" All at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the heads of the savage band concealed within. They were warriors—fifty or more of them—with painted naked bodies. They dashed forward in a wide semicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SERPENT_RIVER_5#0", "contents": "class=\"chap\"/> 3. They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends. They charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird clubs with a threat of death. Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we were about to witness a massacre. \"Captain— Jim ! You're not going to let this happen!\" Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had the same impulse as Campbell—to do something—anything! Yet here we sat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty \"friends\" in danger. Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't duck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and packed themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall. \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\" I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split could drop his dignity under excitement—his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he wanted any sort of split-second order. We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and weaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They were closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party. \"Jim, can we shoot?\" \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\" Split touched the number sixteen signal. The ship's siren wailed out over the land. You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones suddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you ever saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren scream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The attackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life. It jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept right on singing. \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got into it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party had behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our direction from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make out the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately, he marched over the hilltop toward us. Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding places in the ground. But a few—the brave ones, perhaps, or the officials of his group—came with him. \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled. Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I said. Together we descended from the ship. We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first. We slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be one-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively. We didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still retreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And in case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket arsenal of special purpose capsule bombs. Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately"}

And in case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket arsenal of special purpose capsule bombs. Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the cream-and-red cloak. Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against the siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces. Like the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down any main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass. \"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\" \"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very smooth—handsome—attractive.\" Then the siren went off. The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be waiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in close. I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come equipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing medallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a large silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear, dainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\" As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own neck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was not overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it was, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I liked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to place the gift around his neck. \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself. Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud, \"Tomboldo.\" We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then, as the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each breathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of them. One was Gravgak. Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did not know these people's expressions well enough to be sure. Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were painted with green and black diamond designs. By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were invited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we would be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of Tomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose—to understand the Serpent River—would be forwarded greatly if we could learn, through the people, what its meanings were.

I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of Tomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose—to understand the Serpent River—would be forwarded greatly if we could learn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the river's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and to map its course—these facts were only a part of the information we sought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this planet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends they may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when future expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE) for an extension of peaceful trade relationships. Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was safe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees that had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we knew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent. Our ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests of Tomboldo. Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to hear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored the growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with agitated jabbering: \"Wollo—yeeta—vo—vandartch—vandartch! Grr—see—o—see—o—see—o!\" \"See—o—see—o—see—o,\" one of the others echoed. It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The enemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a wholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see—o—see—o\" we were all safe. Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment jacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than a yowling siren. \"See—o—see—o—see—o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand. They must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path. \" See—o—see—o! \" Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees came rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They bounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them. Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No deliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies gleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the nearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed. Shouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the air. I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing sponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits. The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came forward, rushing defiantly. Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their clubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party it must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet the gesture of the"}

He had picked up one of their clubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party it must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet the gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as a warning ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these strange devils will throw fire at you. I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders, thank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip, zip—BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the rocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four warriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were flattened—and those who were able, ran. They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to pick up their clubs. But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious casualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first blast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of the party hovered over him. His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me with suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us stood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages, and held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to consciousness. Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still at his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused a cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it—and then blacked out. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the handle of the club. It whizzed upward with him—apparently all by accident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into my head. I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SERPENT_RIVER_6#0", "contents": "class=\"chap\"/> 4. Vauna, the beautiful daughter of Tomboldo, came into my life during the weeks that I lay unconscious. I must have talked aloud much during those feverish hours of darkness. \"Campbell!\" I would call out of a nightmare. \"Campbell, we're about to land. Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.\" \"S-s-sh!\" The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow penetrate my dream. The voices about me were soft. My dreams echoed the soft female voices of this new, strange language. \"Campbell, are you there?... Have you forgotten the Code, Campbell?\" \"Quiet, Captain.\" \"Who is it that's swabbing my face? I can't see.\" \"It's Vauna. She's smiling at you, Captain. Can't you see her?\" \"Is this the pretty one we saw through the telescope?\" \"One of them.\" \"And what of the other? There were two together. I remember—\" \"Omosla is here too. She's Vauna's attendant. We're all looking after you, Captain Linden. Did you know I performed an operation to relieve the pressure on your brain? You must get well, Captain.\" The words of Campbell came through insistently. After a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said, \"Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?\" \"Of course not, Captain.\" \"Section Four?\" \"Section Four,\" he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put me to sleep. \"Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No agent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed as binding—\" I interrupted. \"Clause D?\" He picked it up. \"D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with any native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain Linden? Or are you warning yourself ?\" At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred vision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her—yes, she must have haunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her features more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the party of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the attack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and figure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's question. \"Myself.\" In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna. The caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella people lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of their life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning about the world into which he has been born. Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together. Often when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire about me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to converse in simple words. And Vauna and I—yes. If I could only avoid blacking out. I wanted to see her. So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares.

If I could only avoid blacking out. I wanted to see her. So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space ships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars. The eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of Vauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand. I regained my health gradually. \"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella words. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you more recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My father is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are still weak.\" It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust myself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By night they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep. Strange harmonies whispered through the caves. And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me through the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me, faintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some corridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to go back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless dreams. The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing before me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a hint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook the fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his flowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and played, \"Trail of Stars.\" \"I have learned to talk,\" I said. \"You have had a long sleep.\" \"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise, the wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will walk soon.\" \"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars and told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the ship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make myself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of forehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying to visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell each other.\" \"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the serpent river .\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not knowing the Benzendella equivalent.

I made an eel-like motion with my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain, the footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked around to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent figure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and green diamond markings—Gravgak. \"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely. \"I get well,\" I said. \"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\" I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant to be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes told me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes flashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and started off. \"Get well!\" The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway he turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\" She started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I will talk with you later, Gravgak.\" \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\" He stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her father, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak. From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic moment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master—or her lover. He had called for her. She had followed. But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door. \"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\" (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called them! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a jealous lover—or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard was a potential traitor?) Vauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been called back. Gravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway he stood scowling. \"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at the assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we will move back to the other part of the world.\" There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber. \"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend—\" he pointed to me—\"is well enough to travel. We would never leave him here to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through the sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget this kindness.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] It's easy to find a solution when there is one—the trick is to do it if there is none! I glanced at the path we had made across the Mare Serenitatis . The Latin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because, as far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth layer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered across the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands of rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above. Considering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity like none I had ever felt. Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because of the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step and every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of dustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the light gravity. Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear. Indifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a dim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak to be reflected toward Earth. We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams of light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's surface. The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained motionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering voice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_2#0", "contents": "Strange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving hulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense of alienness . It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation. Something had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that it hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a year, but the Moon was vast and the Mare Serenitatis covered three hundred and forty thousand square miles. \"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly. Her husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves? If it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\" \"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be beneath the Moon's surface.\" \"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\" \"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached for the radio controls on my suit. Kane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves. If we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we discover something really important, we'll be famous!\" I lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet it carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of an alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for ourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for prestige and wealth. \"All right,\" I conceded. Miller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit. Deliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the brilliant flame against the metal. A few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's steel ... made thousands of years ago.\" Someone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it be in worse shape than this if it was that old?\" Miller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The notch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say steel because it's similar to steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that, on the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even a wind to disturb its surface. It's at least several thousand years old.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_3#0", "contents": "We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane shouted, \"Look!\" A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken by a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and flashed his head-lamp into the dark recess. \"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the opening. We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening to give him as much light as possible. \"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something! It must be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the walls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\" Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features struggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the alienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She hesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage. \"You want to go in?\" my wife asked. \"Do you?\" \"Let's.\" I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned to help Miller. Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert mentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help him as he stepped into the passageway. For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette against the star-studded sky. The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped with pain when he struck the ground. \" Something pushed me!\" \"Are you all right?\" \"Yes.\" He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through the passage.... ... and struck an invisible solid wall."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_4#0", "contents": "My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a recess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with the absence of starlight. \" What happened? \" \"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained. \" What? \" Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a brilliant glare. We turned off our lamps. The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The ceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the smooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault. The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and instruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically. Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door that had imprisoned us. \"Miller!\" \"Yes?\" \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\" I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There were no visible recesses or controls. Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a rough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened breaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong; Miller's was faltering and weak. \"Miller, get help!\" \"I'll—\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently. \"What happened to him?\" \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and trembled beneath the thick gloves. I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City.... Static grated against my ear drums. Static!"}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_5#0", "contents": "I listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by comparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\" \"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between his eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\" Verana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static we hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\" \"It does,\" Marie agreed. \"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over our radio, unless—\" Verana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of white—\"unless we were in outer space!\" We stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to speak of our fantastic suspicion. I deactivated my radio. Marie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow corridor beyond. Simultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press against my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the pressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on our bodies. We looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the open door. We went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed next and I was the last. We walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were featureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were the outlines of doors without handles or locks. Kane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was unyielding. I manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small amount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously. It smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I increased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed my helmet. \"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in this place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits later.\" They saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by one removed their own helmets."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_6#0", "contents": "At the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat on his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was a pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of metal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited easily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel. \"The end of the line,\" he grunted. As though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened soundlessly. He went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand. The door closed behind him. Marie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\" Verana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the corridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice. Before I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through the doorway. Verana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles frozen by shock. The door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form. Verana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the other doors that lined the hall. I put my arms around her, held her close. \"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly. For several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the preceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them. The Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of other people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means of recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse themselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as that: a walk on the Moon. We had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock formations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien ship. My legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's perfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible situation, there was no sensation of unreality."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_7#0", "contents": "I took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our steps. We had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors opened soundlessly. Verana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp. Six doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the ones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered. This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms. I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly. The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing thousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four chairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each chair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting column. \"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a trembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are food!\" The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them. The first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and bottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening the containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes and the woman drinking from a bottle. \"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said. I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my fingers. The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance. I tasted a small piece. \"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\" Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid. \"Milk!\" she exclaimed. \"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_8#0", "contents": "The next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were filled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the form of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a fashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen. Two of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a spongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing. Another room contained a small bathing pool, running water, waste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap. The last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were transparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then disappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position. \"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by the movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a hyperspatial drive to conquer the stars. We selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit cigarettes and waited. A few minutes later, Marie entered the room. I noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was excited, her actions didn't betray it. She sat next to Verana. \"What happened?\" my wife asked. Marie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing a new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared silly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect. Something touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice—\" \"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted. \"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to hurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was the oddest feeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in a nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt something search my mind and gather information. I could actually feel it search my memories!\" \"What memories?\" I inquired. She frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It seemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched for memories of our customs and lives in general....\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_9#0", "contents": "Kane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger. \" Do you know where we are? \" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens got me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're guinea pigs!\" \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly remembered that she was a member of a club that investigated extra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She was probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically. \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they explained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their zoo!\" \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested. He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This ship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago, they came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living in caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like when we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a sort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made spaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship and enter it— like rabbits in a snare! \" \"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed. \"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep us there while they study us.\" \"How long will the trip take?\" I asked. \"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned months! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\" Marie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the terror inside her. \"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be interesting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us—\" \"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped. Verana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A race that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves? Dissection is primitive. They won't have to dissect us in order to study us. They'll have more advanced methods.\" \"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly. \"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the Moon!\" \"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible source and seemed to fill the room."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_10#0", "contents": "Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's mind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\" Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls. \"Where are you? Who are you?\" \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\" \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\" \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted phrases, the tone was cold and mechanical. \"What are your—your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked anxiously. \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine you. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like when it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on your Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity toward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\" I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship and asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the ship?\" \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food, oxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to prevent the fifth from entering the ship.\" \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll find some way to make it take us back to Earth.\" \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us. For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to force our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms. The only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were the containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or hard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_11#0", "contents": "Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had been imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work on. The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that opened into the corridor. After intensive searching, we realized there was no way to damage the ship or reach any section other than our allotted space. We gave up. The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to the \"kitchen.\" At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and discussed our predicament. \"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed his fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out! Every problem has a solution!\" \"You sure?\" I asked. \"What?\" \" Does every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some problems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our civilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape. Primarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A murderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an entire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours is now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned few criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds to lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I don't think we have a chance.\" My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's wife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that few people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_12#0", "contents": "For several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a distinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth. Kane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost choked. \"Whiskey!\" \"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to create a comparable one,\" the machine explained. I selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger than our own,\" I informed the machine. We drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at the alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere. He beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised knuckles. \"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded. \" Why? \" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\" \"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged condition.\" Kane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly. \"Shtop me, then!\" \"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you other than use of your language.\" It took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment. After I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and stretched out on the soft floor beside Verana. I tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at the start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools or weapons. Solution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years could think of one! I wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had foreseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented the wheel. That thought awed me—somehow they had analyzed our brains thousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments would be. They had been able to predict our scientific development, but they hadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were curious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the Moon. The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't help thinking, And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem impossibly clever . I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_13#0", "contents": "When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully. I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were functioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen asleep a few hours before. I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was bound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us, Marie was secured to another chair. Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he appeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled and his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness. \"Awake, huh?\" \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were red with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she looked at him. \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you on the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly. \"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I had to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or cooperate with me.\" \"What's your plan?\" I asked. He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in a zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that this problem has a solution.\" I grunted my disgust. \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the aliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put a lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion because the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\" \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone. \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and question us. Right?\" \"Right.\" \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\" \"What remark?\" \"It said, ' My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\""}

I didn't have the slightest idea of what he was driving at and I told him so. \"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of making decisions, how would you build it?\" \"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed. \"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this ship, I'd build it with a conscience so it'd do its best at all times.\" \"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm getting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged while asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been present, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him. \" Our machines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch buttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic brain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it even has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\" \"So what?\" He shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a thinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered such a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last night figuring—\" \"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you don't know—\" \"I'll show you, Ed.\" He walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick fingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath. \"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air. \"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied. \"Watch!\" Kane tightened his fingers around my throat. Verana and Marie screamed shrilly. My head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully. \"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded. \"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return to them with a cargo of dead people!\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Snare_15#0", "contents": "The machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to interfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had said it had no way to control our actions! \"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you return with dead specimens!\" \"No,\" the machine admitted. \"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill all of us !\" The alien electronic brain was silent. By this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway thing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only tightened as I struggled. \"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you failed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't bring them proof of your failure.\" My fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as it struggled with the problem. \"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to your masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us to the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission later.\" A long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go. A soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning even their shrieks in strangling blackness. \"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\" Kane released his grip on my throat. \"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\" I didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again."}

But his luck had run its course, and now he was marooned on a rogue planet—fighting to save himself from a menace weapons could not kill. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \" And so, my dear ,\" Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase, \" I'm afraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets—or is it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do, you'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway, there will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've accepted. I did love you.... Good-by. \" Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last letter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they never failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as the palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a perpetual wonder—limpid as a child's. The barbaric rhythms of the Congahua , were a background of annoyance in Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian dancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace, began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful, in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left him cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts in silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not to speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom upon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one solitude—the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests. Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending. When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of Marla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not fill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded. True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his fault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian Chamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been ready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers that almost surrounded the space pirate. A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every dream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use of hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as if by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's soul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality under the ineffable illumination of the Chamber. It cost a young fortune."}

It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a fortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a sheaf of credits—it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and most of his heart in Marla. Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the insidious Verbena , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty glass of Martian Bacca-glas , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel eyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a young Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in those eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy? Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger brought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could instantly denote. His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this Martian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter had edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad semi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in a final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and tilted back invitingly. Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the handsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the tinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand, and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his feet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one side as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis Brooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl cried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was not there."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SOUL_EATERS_2#0", "contents": "Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided the murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all Martians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the Martian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin that staggered and all but dropped him. The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back and sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he was not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for Dennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took it, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over with all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and spun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly sagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor. Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international police arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search, the police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his left arm-pit—an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the interplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still without the law were known to possess them. \"Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck, Brooke!\" The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. \"If I'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew. Who else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have in his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records on that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they have details on this dandy!\" He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian embroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of red, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black acerine on his finger. Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to shame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curved his generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of Koerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again—you don't know Bertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!\" He reached for his glass of Verbena but the table had turned over during the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming Bacca-glas shards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of the venomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of the guests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor who was shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive Palace. \"Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis,\" the lieutenant said gently. \"We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, the credit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is a hoodoo!\""}

He eyed the six foot four frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as if uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a decision, he were forcing himself to speak: \"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for two reasons. The first one you already know—your capture of one of Koerber's henchmen—has given us a line as to his present orbit of piracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not really why I've brought you here.\" He frowned again as if what he had to say were difficult indeed. \"Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her—a delicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and very clever young lady could perform. And,\" he paused, grimacing, \"somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing her and several other passengers, began to send distress signals. Finally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days overdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold millions, the spacer itself—seem to have vanished.\" Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel eyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits that smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides, while something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel precision. \"Marla!\" He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power of Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an atom-blast. \"Commander,\" Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of emotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself—and that grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known every change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul. \"Commander, give me one ... one chance at that spawn of unthinkable begetting! Let me try, and I promise you ...\" in his torture, Dennis was unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surface of the priceless desk, \"I promise you that I will either bring you Koerber, or forfeit my life!\" Commander Bertram nodded his head. \"I brought you here for that purpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where the last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!\" He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set on his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. \"You'll now see a visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left Venus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel in space. This, Dennis,\" the Commander emphasized his words, \"is your chance to redeem yourself!\" He fell silent, while the viso-screen began to show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer up-tilted in its cradle."}

On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real. A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on the viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud interplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void, and suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved as if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining altitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic course, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's side. Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in actuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it was an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with deadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of the barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank. Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose features were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor and the burning fire in his eyes. \"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach Terra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other transports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes they're never seen again.\" \"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin of ice. \"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with double hull—a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed of the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses anything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination room, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He extended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have—aside from your recklessness—and on your success depends far more than the capture of an outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\" II Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a phantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally elusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of fathomless space. To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first assignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the inner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance against stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even their cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked the luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol spacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was hoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a thing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the comfortable luxury that they knew.

Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits, manning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and eternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast. And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search as a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the viso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to life. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured the space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the viso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and becoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport. Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke commanded through the teleradio from the control room: \"Prepare to board!\" Every member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for all but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his apprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt nauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of space. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale when the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who were to go beside himself: \"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\" \"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in his basso-profundo voice. \"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice of the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test oxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\" George Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the space to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a proud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he turned away with a look of shame. Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed survey. \"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo missing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were out of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been fired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly he seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced. Somehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed, where life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great resolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him. Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in thinking of her and all he had lost.

When he finally spoke, his voice was harsh, laconic: \"Prepare to return!\" Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a major battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter, shifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and gazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various versions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit in their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe. Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow, easygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the swiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of men toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third lieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed by Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as if the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched them intimately."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SOUL_EATERS_5#0", "contents": "Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George Randall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the airlocks and removed the space suits. \"Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet Analyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!\" He was fairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the new invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great distance were his own achievement. Dennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he prayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger spacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp 39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None but a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the dangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric uncharted orbits. Dennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room, followed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in any form was anathema. There could be no doubt now! The \"Jet Analyzer\" recorded powerful disturbance, atomic—could be nothing else. Instantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker: \"Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!\" Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved motors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each member of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action impended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed relief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men suddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth. All but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped his throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P. uniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to keep calm, his hands trembled beyond control. In the compact, super-armored control room, Captain Brooke watched the telecast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that were golden with anticipation. It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at last, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally reached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by leaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the distance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit. But at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen, unmistakably for what it was—a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden maneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described a parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if navigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the asteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose the I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have succeeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such a trap without specific orders.

Ordinarily, it would have succeeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such a trap without specific orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the chase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he could take Koerber with him. Weaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his quarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo from starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up spewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last. From the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain of atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward midship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been mortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power dive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as he came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was ripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under the detonating impact. It was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming immediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass, but too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no avail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was doomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SOUL_EATERS_6#0", "contents": "With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis maneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he sank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the maneuver avoided it. \"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all jets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed out of the increasing gravity trap. \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the jets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then Koerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught, forced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of a whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that shook the trapped cruiser like a leaf. Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to meet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy. It showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active. Gravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this unknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time was supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could possibly explain the incredible gravity. And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to Randall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action, too late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent a crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding them in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them. III The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided a man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser, the strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them, was anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against the sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in the cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could reach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon. \"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he turned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her up, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\" Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into the forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower petals. The crash-landing had not helped either. \"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain, but,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud. \"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his ordinarily gentle voice like a lash. \"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting shot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed.

Tom tugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed mournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long, ragged line of cliffs. \"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing a job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast and out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\" \"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in this hellish rock-pile?\" \"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale, impassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\" \"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His contemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who failed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place in the I.S.P. \"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said thoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\" \"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for our atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal optimist. \"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom, you get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log book, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try to find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a low voice, but with such passion that the others were startled. A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear the last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead bumped during the crash landing. \"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue. \"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you wanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\" \"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding job....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the words had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His candid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage with its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened the anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized this was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better men than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space.

But there had been an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in the grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung his neck! \"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll need all hands now.\" \"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his mouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon him, he whirled and re-entered the ship. \"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook his head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin shook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat. \"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed. \"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in this than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\" \"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds on my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar. Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat a thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one they re-entered the cruiser."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew less than the crew—all their lives hung upon it! There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were looking at it so analytically. \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my word on that, Captain Gavin.\" \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\" \"You'll get over feeling like that.\" \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\" \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you haven't—it's your first trip. This always means transphasia—cortex dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect—call it anything you like, it's still transphasia.\" \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\" \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen. \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\" \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us they can't even recognize our existence.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPICY_SOUND_OF_SUCCESS_2#0", "contents": "I drew myself up to my full height—and noticed in irritation it was still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about everything else, even your own life.\" \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to retirement.\" \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\" \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space, with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary caution the service likes in officers.\" \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\" \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more than a figurehead.\" Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the first orbital ships. \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\" \"We go out and find the reason.\" \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\" \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\" I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such familiar conditions—right?\" \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPICY_SOUND_OF_SUCCESS_3#0", "contents": "\"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate. \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's solid.\" The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide, so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink sunlight. \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul as soon as you let it into the airlock.\" \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\" \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\" The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply. The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it. But what else can you do with a wail but hear it? Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's trace it.\" \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\" \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing tastes, touching odors—or any other combination. Don't let it bother you.\" \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\" Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\" \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and staying alive.\" There was no reply. His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass. We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our hides. The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under my skin. \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe. \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize, Captain?\" \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste here.\" \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\" \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\" \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of Centauri blushtalk and the like.\" It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you smell them for the first time."}

We must have compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\" Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second. The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I couldn't quite make out. Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain. \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\" He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an exploration party, you know, sir.\" \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any further from the ship.\" \"That's important, Captain?\" \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This—condition—didn't begin until we got so far away from the spacer—in time or distance. I don't want it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\" \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to free-fall.\" But he turned back. \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational jamming here.\" I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea. Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt—those were the blips. Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He was reading the map too. The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge. There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had known for an instant as a streak of spice. \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough to get used to it.\" He said nothing on the route back to the spacer."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPICY_SOUND_OF_SUCCESS_5#0", "contents": "\"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot, Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time. My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar. I was hot and tired, fresh—in only the chronological sense—from a pressure suit. \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women? Transphasia?\" \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our current psychophysiological phenomenon.\" I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off, let's hear what you know about—never mind, make it dogs.\" \"Take Bruce, for example, then—\" \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\" \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own master is the most content.\" \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\" \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick you themselves.\" \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\" \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\" \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\" He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain. I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\" \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select their own leader?\""}

Fresh from the cosmic energy test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\" I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing, Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less human nature. Even I know that much!\" He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\" \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to think of me—of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this ship.\" \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his status.\" The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski. \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\" \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's permission....\" \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited. \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were, but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\" \"How far can we run it back?\" Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\" \"How many?\" \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see, smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\" \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you know.\" \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly. \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from transphasia. Is that it?\" Quade gave a curt nod. \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\""}

Through the portal I could see the suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray projectors. \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and shook his head disapprovingly. \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we complete the survey.\" \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\" \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship.\" \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\" \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration, why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\" Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this, and this isn't the way.\" \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em take a part of that environment with them.\" \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust, you are risking more than a few men—you risk the whole mission in gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\" \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\" \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\" \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I know it has to be wrong.\" I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway. \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\" \"I would,\" I answered levelly. \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\" \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\" \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\" \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what I said as long as I command this spacer.\" \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before.

One mistake was too many for me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw. No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world. The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment? I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very well be true, but how did that help now? I had to think . I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane reasons—he was the most important member of the crew. With him around, there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have endless opinions to contend with. But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he. There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in spacesuits. But how would that leave us any better off than Quade? Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he would be? How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable?"}

He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent that hide. You got it made.\" \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these air-fast joints.\" \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\" \"I'm talking about something we do understand— sound . These suits perfectly soundproof?\" \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have—\" \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the sound.\" \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but—\" \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his only chance.\" \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\" \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\" Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\" \"That would do it.\" \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPICY_SOUND_OF_SUCCESS_10#0", "contents": "I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\" \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\" \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested. \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate—\" \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass notes.\" Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\" \"Good. There's one more thing—how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\" Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\" \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay, Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we have left?\" The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more about half full.\" \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get some light wine....\" \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\" \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\" \"Ration it to the men!\" \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\" \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\" \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\" \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't like to think how they would taste.\" \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are going.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only, and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\" I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley. I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\""}

The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across the dark, rich taste of the planet. I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare. The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time. We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt something dark and ominous in the outside air. \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly. \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling, sir?\" \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\" \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\" A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my shelf—my, that is, self.\" The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels. \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\" \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\" \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\" \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\" I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge. A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and Circumstance . Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges. The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming wind—psychosomatic reaction—and his heating circuits compensated for the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\""}

Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too much for us—we were too tired, too numb, too drunk. At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it looked good to me, like home. The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight. I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time. The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it. \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be dangerous.\" Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\" Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged toward the herd. \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\" I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea. As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly. \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\" The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames. \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit. \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us get past their circle.\" It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us. \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\" I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade. The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an eighty-degree angle. I was stone sober. The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or taking cover. The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer sat on his haunches and waited for us to move."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_SPICY_SOUND_OF_SUCCESS_13#0", "contents": "\"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary. He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far have you got in the tractors?\" \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and getting stuck here.\" \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\" \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track. Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators. Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\" \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing to death—if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\" I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience is less painful and more efficient.\" Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir—I don't understand how you got me away from those aliens.\" \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier than they could.\" \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all the time.\" \"But they did! First, that call of theirs—it wasn't to lead us into danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that far up the intelligence scale.\" \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously. \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog came to Nagurski.\" \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never going to be that foolhardy again.\" \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\" \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\" \"In that case, I must inform you that I am"}

I just hope I don't forget.\" I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of experience aboard. \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\""}

WESTLAKE Illustrated by WEST [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine October 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened to destroy everything that was noble and decent—including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window sticking at full transparency—well, I won't go through the whole sorry list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put the roof on the city, as they say. It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken. But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my mind to do it—to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this morning—right after the egg yolk—and invited myself down to her place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten o'clock, she meant ten o'clock. Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job, of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots, were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other Project and had blown itself up. Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time, shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had happened—I'd broken a shoe lace—she refused to speak to me for four days. And then the elevator didn't come."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_2#0", "contents": "Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg—I couldn't very well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment and I was hungry—and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that gaspingly transparent window—one hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag—I kept going over and over my prepared proposal speeches, trying to select the most effective one. I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment. Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend that time with than you.\" Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of marriage other than Non-P—Non-Permanent, No Progeny. So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment at five minutes to ten. Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away. It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I was giving myself plenty of time. But then the elevator didn't come. I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't understand it. The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour. I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late. It didn't arrive. I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to give her advance warning that I would be late? Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white letters on black: PRIVACY"}

Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted. Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute late. No matter. It didn't arrive. I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three. I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_3#0", "contents": "It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and——\" \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she were growing very used to saying it. It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her. \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen. I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it, giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\" \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that——\" \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly at her screen and parroted her responses. But now she was actually looking at me . I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have ruined my life.\" She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\" \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you understand me?\" She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too preoccupied to notice it at the time. \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection, a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\" \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\" \"I'm not shouting!\" \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your—\" \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury. She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen, revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out, sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is—\" she leaned even closer to the screen—\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II It was my turn to be stunned. I just gaped at her. \"A—a what?\" \"A spy.

We can't control the elevator from outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims the elevator at them.\" That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\" \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush anybody who goes after him.\" \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\" She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're afraid they'll have to starve him out.\" \"Oh, no!\" She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said, \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen. For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked! What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected? Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present threat of other projects had never been more for me—or for most other people either, I suspected—than occasional ore-sleds that didn't return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. Dr. Kilbillie—Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years old—had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.

After all, those external dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. Dr. Kilbillie—Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years old—had private names for every major war of the twentieth century. There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as World Wars One, Two, and Three. The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of many many factors, but two of the most important were the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course, meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things, the population explosion. And the Treaty of Oslo. It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which meant that no Projects were bombed. Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected radioactive particles. However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose"}

And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it go at that."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_4#0", "contents": "But now there was a spy in the elevator. When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the other side of them. I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda. I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen. I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient reason for me to be late. He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out. I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway. I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old. Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators, didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was the use of stairs? Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary information), the Project had been built when there still had been such things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them. And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps. Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could. If the door would open. It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing, took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor. On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with difficulty. I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE ELEVATOR SHAFT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY KEEP LOCKED I frowned, wondering immediately why"}

They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE ELEVATOR SHAFT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY KEEP LOCKED I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already. Somebody in authority might simply have goofed. As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and the spy came out, waving a gun. III He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous, in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the elevator shaft. Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us open-mouthed and wide-eyed. Unfortunately, he recovered first. He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\" I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound. Which left me quite free to study him. He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to my parents' apartment. His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\" I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I said. \"Good,\" he said—just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending boots. The Army! But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He said, \"Where do you live?\" \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man. I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to either escape or capture him. \"All right,\""}

I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to either escape or capture him. \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun. And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back, and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\" I nodded. \"All right. Let's go.\" We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I thumbed the door open and we went inside. Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile playing across his lips. I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\" \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\" \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got any chico coffee?\" \"Yes.\" \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with boiling water.\" \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two cups, lunch and dinner.\" \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\""}

From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains. As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then, \"What do you do for a living?\" I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie, of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about it. Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included wrestling, judo and karati—talents I would prefer to disclose to him in my own fashion, when the time came. He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the ore-sleds?\" I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much. \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up? Don't you people ever test them?\" \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and their cargo before they're brought into the building.\" \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\" \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\" \"For what? Who cares about that?\" He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\" I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told him. \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\" Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of course not!\" \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia, before he ever made that first step from the cave?\" \"I have no idea,\" I told him. \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped. \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all the time."}

I nodded politely. \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself. \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his tail between his legs. That's what he did!\" To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by saying, \"Here's your coffee.\" \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac to watchful spy. I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\" \"Of course,\" I said. He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\" He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I—I wouldn't know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\" \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\" \"The defenses—\" I started. \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what other defenses are there? None.\" \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy spy. \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded. \"Well, of course.\" \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\" \"Well—\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by one of the other projects.\" \"And do they find any indications, ever?\" \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified information.\" \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that I'm doing the same thing, right?\" \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted. \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\" I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\" He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy!

He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my Project?\" I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\" \"How do I know that?\" he demanded. \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\" \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\" I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\" \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like all the other people in this mausoleum?\" \"Now, wait a minute—\" \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm going to tell you what I am.\" I waited, looking as attentive as possible. \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here. I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\" The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the violence that was so obviously in this lunatic. \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\" And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all. \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked on the reactor.

I Clyde W. Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied, with the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered in a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's travel-stained six foot one. \"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward the florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something that needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding safeguarding my paintings.\" \"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great help to you.\" \"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored into Dan like hot pokers. \"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards here—the papers are full of it—\" \"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press, I'd have no concern for my paintings today!\" \"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left unguarded.\" \"Now, wait a minute—\" Kelly started. \"What's that?\" Snithian cut in. \"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day and night—\" \"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped. \"—but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished. \"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the vault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\" \"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said. \"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\" \"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a man in that vault.\" \"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've made you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more nonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked away, his cloak flapping at his knees. \"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an art lover.\" \"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He turned in at an office and closed the door. \"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If those pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad. Just how cheap would you work?\" \"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he added. Kelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check.

{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_2#0", "contents": "Dan looked around at the gray walls, with shelves stacked to the low ceiling with wrapped paintings. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a white glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk, an arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates, plastic utensils and a portable radio—all hastily installed at Kelly's order. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami, liverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a well-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer. It wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off without a hitch. Basically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing from closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was obvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large canvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards—and leaving the locks undamaged. Yet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults—someone who hadn't entered in the usual way. Theory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The Snithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With such a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the vault—day and night—waiting—he would see for himself how they operated. He finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of the brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he slid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air cafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered at a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a magazine. It was a cheerful scene; Dan liked it. Still, it hardly seemed worth all the effort.... He went to the wall switch and turned off the lights. The orange glow of the filaments died, leaving only a faint illumination from the night-light over the door. When the thieves arrived, it might give him a momentary advantage if his eyes were adjusted to the dark. He groped his way to the bunk. So far, so good, he reflected, stretching out. When they showed up, he'd have to handle everything just right. If he scared them off there'd be no second chance. He would have lost his crack at—whatever his discovery might mean to him. But he was ready. Let them come."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_3#0", "contents": "Eight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly from a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded shelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air. The apparition was an open-work cage—about the size and shape of an out-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures were visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs. They glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework. A faint sound cut into the stillness—a descending whine. The cage moved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped, crackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage settled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly switches.... The glow died. Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth was dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it was here— Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had prepared for the occasion: Greeting, visitors from the Future.... Hopelessly corny. What about: Welcome to the Twentieth Century.... No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to Dan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now looked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with a cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves looked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and balding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed Dan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the table, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at the stacked shelves. \"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said. \"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\" \"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd best hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\" \"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\" The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting. \"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\" Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack. \"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\" \"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone—\" Manny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still prefer nood dames, Fiorello.\" \"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play of rich browns!\" \"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was popular with the sparrows.\" \"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations—\" \"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting in the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting clattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\" \"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\" \"I've—ah—been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I—\" \"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\" Manny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow, Fiorello.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty—\" \"Don't"}

He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow, Fiorello.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty—\" \"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty tough guys when aroused.\" \"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings—\" \"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the gent's room—\" \"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\" Dan shook his head. \"No leak. I simply deduced—\" \"Look, Fiorello,\" Manny said. \"You chin if you want to; I'm doing a fast fade.\" \"Don't act hastily, Manny. You know where you'll end.\" \"Wait a minute!\" Dan shouted. \"I'd like to make a deal with you fellows.\" \"Ah-hah!\" Kelly's voice blared from somewhere. \"I knew it! Slane, you crook!\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_4#0", "contents": "Dan looked about wildly. The voice seemed to be issuing from a speaker. It appeared Kelly hedged his bets. \"Mr. Kelly, I can explain everything!\" Dan called. He turned back to Fiorello. \"Listen, I figured out—\" \"Pretty clever!\" Kelly's voice barked. \"Inside job. But it takes more than the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.\" \"Perhaps you were right, Manny,\" Fiorello said. \"Complications are arising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.\" He edged toward the cage. \"What about this ginzo?\" Manny jerked a thumb toward Dan. \"He's on to us.\" \"Can't be helped.\" \"Look—I want to go with you!\" Dan shouted. \"I'll bet you do!\" Kelly's voice roared. \"One more minute and I'll have the door open and collar the lot of you! Came up through a tunnel, did you?\" \"You can't go, my dear fellow,\" Fiorello said. \"Room for two, no more.\" Dan whirled to the cot, grabbed up the pistol Kelly had supplied. He aimed it at Manny. \"You stay here, Manny! I'm going with Fiorello in the time machine.\" \"Are you nuts?\" Manny demanded. \"I'm flattered, dear boy,\" Fiorello said, \"but—\" \"Let's get moving. Kelly will have that lock open in a minute.\" \"You can't leave me here!\" Manny spluttered, watching Dan crowd into the cage beside Fiorello. \"We'll send for you,\" Dan said. \"Let's go, Fiorello.\" The balding man snatched suddenly for the gun. Dan wrestled with him. The pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the far corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted aside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back into the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault. \"Manny!\" Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his companion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his heels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A cop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan grabbed a lever at random and pulled. Sudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral Kelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan swallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an elevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides. Hastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky business. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing in among brick and mortar particles.... But this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the way he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted—in a way. The time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled back into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft of the past decade on him. It couldn't be too hard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the controls...."}

{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_5#0", "contents": "Dan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently, in eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan gritted his teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage. Then he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cook waddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowly from the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated a second ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall. Cautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest an inch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled so much as a minute into the past or future. He looked over the controls. There should be one labeled \"Forward\" and another labeled \"Back\", but all the levers were plain, unadorned black. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance of something thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, it worked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the usual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here somewhere.... Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall. A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In another second she would see him, and give the alarm—and Dan needed a few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls. He moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through the wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever back. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table— The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not over eighteen, Dan thought—as nearly as he could tell with the blue light playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon, and long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis racquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and the cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple, and began briskly unbuttoning her shirt. Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another; he rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the zipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward the outer wall as the girl reached behind her back.... Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering twenty feet above a clipped lawn. He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the cage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped out on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face up— Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall.

He was in a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter filled with glowing blue plants— The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she took a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square sunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside, seemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled— With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the cage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with an acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the controls, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed on, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town, approaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up fifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it— He covered his ears, braced himself— With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the cage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop. Dan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud click! and the glow faded. With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at a simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through elaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a potted plant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far side of the room a desk. And behind the desk—Something. II Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a hundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from points eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded and reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three peanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just above the brown eyes. \"Who're you?\" a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor. \"I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.\" \"What happened to Manny and Fiorello?\" \"They—I—There was this cop. Kelly—\" \"Oh-oh.\" The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered hands closed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer. \"Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted,\" the basso voice said. \"A pity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still....\" A noise like an amplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth. \"How ... what...?\" \"The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below a critical value,\" the voice said. \"A necessary measure to discourage big ideas on the part of wisenheimers"}

Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one's anonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps at present. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?\" Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes, accustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out the vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed giraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face similar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted around the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire into a black sky. \"Too bad.\" The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted, caught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up to catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily at work studying the ceiling. \"I hope,\" the voice said, \"that you ain't harboring no reactionary racial prejudices.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_6#0", "contents": "\"Gosh, no,\" Dan reassured the eye. \"I'm crazy about—uh—\" \"Vorplischers,\" the voice said. \"From Vorplisch, or Vega, as you call it.\" The Bronx cheer sounded again. \"How I long to glimpse once more my native fens! Wherever one wanders, there's no pad like home.\" \"That reminds me,\" Dan said. \"I have to be running along now.\" He sidled toward the door. \"Stick around, Dan,\" the voice rumbled. \"How about a drink? I can offer you Chateau Neuf du Pape, '59, Romance Conte, '32, goat's milk, Pepsi—\" \"No, thanks.\" \"If you don't mind, I believe I'll have a Big Orange.\" The Vorplischer swiveled to a small refrigerator, removed an immense bottle fitted with a nipple and turned back to Dan. \"Now, I got a proposition which may be of some interest to you. The loss of Manny and Fiorello is a serious blow, but we may yet recoup the situation. You made the scene at a most opportune time. What I got in mind is, with those two clowns out of the picture, a vacancy exists on my staff, which you might well fill. How does that grab you?\" \"You mean you want me to take over operating the time machine?\" \"Time machine?\" The brown eyes blinked alternately. \"I fear some confusion exists. I don't quite dig the significance of the term.\" \"That thing,\" Dan jabbed a thumb toward the cage. \"The machine I came here in. You want me—\" \"Time machine,\" the voice repeated. \"Some sort of chronometer, perhaps?\" \"Huh?\" \"I pride myself on my command of the local idiom, yet I confess the implied concept snows me.\" The nine-fingered hands folded on the desk. The beachball head leaned forward interestedly. \"Clue me, Dan. What's a time machine?\" \"Well, it's what you use to travel through time.\" The brown eyes blinked in agitated alternation. \"Apparently I've loused up my investigation of the local cultural background. I had no idea you were capable of that sort of thing.\" The immense head leaned back, the wide mouth opening and closing rapidly. \"And to think I've been spinning my wheels collecting primitive 2-D art!\" \"But—don't you have a time machine? I mean, isn't that one?\" \"That? That's merely a carrier. Now tell me more about your time machines. A fascinating concept! My superiors will be delighted at this development—and astonished as well. They regard this planet as Endsville.\""}
{"chunk_id": "THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_7#0", "contents": "\"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he could reach the machine and try a getaway— \"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said, following Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch yellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm afraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best introduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth Class, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop new sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire Secondary Quadrant.\" \"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That has to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just materialize out of thin air like that.\" \"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You shouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel, that everyone has. Now—\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper—\"I'll make a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good condition for me. And in return—\" \" I'm supposed to supply you with a time machine?\" Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out, Dan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal entry, illegal possession of property, trespass—then doubtless some embarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr. Kelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would deal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\" The Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the desk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan. \"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me got the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up with an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I should say. What about it, Dan?\" \"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine—\" \"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously. \"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested. Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it. \"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local branch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\" \"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\" \"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and—\" \"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He took the directory, studied it. \"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice it. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a large.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel cells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in the carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan. Get a wiggle on.\""}

Blote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct me, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you said.\" \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that way.\" Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky. Faint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan looked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure. \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped smoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated. \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to get us to the right place.\" \"Very well, Dan.\" Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly seen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage grew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained. The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying landmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely visible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers along both sides of the passage at once. \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines employ a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\" \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where they do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered left, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous figures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed wrong— The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus. Blote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete walls, the barred door and— \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed. \"Grab him!\" someone yelled. Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt to regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a lever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures as the carrier shot away through the cell wall. III Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the clear, he would have to decide on his next move—fast. There was no telling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide the carrier, then— A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume. Dan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction. The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of mechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous landscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the deafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once. If the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked the controls, dropping toward the distant earth. The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought the carrier in to the corner of a wide park."}

Dan worked the controls, dropping toward the distant earth. The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought the carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few inches and cut the switch. As the glow died, the siren faded into silence. Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise was, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians in the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why hadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no sound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a secluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in, reached for the controls— There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials before him frosted over. There was a loud pop! like a flashbulb exploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle which hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded to blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a tight-fitting white uniform stepped through. Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face, the long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly red-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat pillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set yellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in a smile which showed square yellowish teeth. \" Alors, monsieur ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in a quick bow. \" Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas? \" \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\" \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me. Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class five, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\" \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\" Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to stop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\" \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked. \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\" \"Inter-what?\" \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our language coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\" \"What do you want with me?\""}

THE VALLEY By Richard Stockham Illustrated by Ed Emsh If you can't find it countless millions of miles in space, come back to Earth. You might find it just on the other side of the fence—where the grass is always greener. The Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver fish. Inside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of land that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground cracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and the seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the city circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a desert under a blazing sun. The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made it!\" Another voice, shaking, said, \"President—Davis is—overwhelmed. He can't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people—with our hope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\" The voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship. \"I can't tell them,\" said the man. \"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\" The woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\" \"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one grain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a cinder.\" A note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right? Stand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\" \"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They sent us out. They've waited so long—.\" He stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet they could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\" He touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right now, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would be over.\" \"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\" \"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm tired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\" She spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved you. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please, Michael.\" He looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to Earth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\""}

{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_2#0", "contents": "The great, white ship settled to Earth that was like a plain after flood waters have drained away. The man and woman came out into the blazing sunlight. A shout, like the crashing of a thousand surfs, rose and broke over them. The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials gathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of white faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned toward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the cries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had stood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff. And, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping throng. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for an answer, a salvation, a happy end. Now the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to them in voices of reverence. A microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered admonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them, open and green and moist, on a virgin planet. The cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing like an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing, sucking the water from the seas. And then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead. For some time we've known the other planets in our solar system were uninhabitable. Now we've been from one end of the galaxy to the other. And this is what we've found.... We were given Earth. There's no place else for us. The rest of the planets in the galaxy were given to others. There's no place else for them. We've all had a chance to make the best of Earth. Instead we've made the worst of it. So we're here to stay—and die.\" He handed the microphone back. The silence did not change. The President grasped Michael's arm. \"What're you saying?\" A buzzing rose up from the people like that of a swarm of frightened bees. The sea of white faces swayed and their voices began to cry. The din and motion held, long and drawn out, with a wail now and a fluttering beneath it. Michael and the woman stood above them in the center of the pale, hovering faces of the officials. \"Good God,\" said the President. \"You've got to tell them what you said isn't true!\" \"We've been searching two thousand years for a truth,\" said Michael. \"A thousand of us have died finding it. I've told it. That's the way it's got to be.\" The President swayed, took the microphone in his hands. \"There's been some mistake!\" he cried. \"Go back to the pumps and the distilleries! Go back to the water vats and the gardens and the flocks! Go back! Work and wait! We'll get the full truth to you. Everything's going to be all right !\" Obediently the mass of faces separated, as though they were being spun away on a"}

{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_3#0", "contents": "They ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council chambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood desks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And on a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet square. The President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you heard, they report—complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now, the proof.\" Michael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair. The lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in the darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around. Suddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled with a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the watching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an ocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance. Now streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of lightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling, like comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts flashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time passing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they themselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward blinding balls of white light, the size of moons. The dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved forward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many mixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming to be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a razor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson. Flat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A roaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear flowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they gasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere of this planet would disintegrate a human being. Now the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and the blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks of rocket flame shooting away in all directions. Suddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and died, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the death of a ship. They were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they saw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw creatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and blobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking about, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They saw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at incredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs and arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but invisible.

They saw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at incredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs and arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but invisible. And those watching the screen on which time and distance were a compressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and thousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks and whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were aware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some that would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into flame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid. They saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of blackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must ever move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck that was Earth. The picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts, showing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the man cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the woman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where solutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was held at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon them from many pencil like tubes. The watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into human embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and extend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and cared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the ship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their bodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them in the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into space—all this through millions of miles and a hundred years, compressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of space. Instantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers of flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships. And then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a blazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker; saw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past the swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark nothingness. Great balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them into grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another ship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great, yellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked"}

Another burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the darkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies drowned in the depths of an Arctic sea. At this instant from the watching council, there were screams of horror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a moving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval grew in volume. Another ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and the bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the contorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams and cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\" Lights flashed through the room and the picture died."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_4#0", "contents": "Michael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the agonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in clutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa. There was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing of the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to quiet his trembling. \"There—there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in space. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for hundreds of years.\" Michael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\" \"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time, the sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man was struck by one of the ground cars and everyone who saw it went insane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no one is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for so long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\" \"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had been real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people there'd be mass hysteria.\" \"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would involve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people who left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in space.\" \"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President gravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\" The pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the council chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing out; the terror in them was fading away. \"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you can't bring it back to life.\" \"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic wars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long time ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now you've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around, slowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\" \"None.\" \"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\" Michael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr. President.\" There were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered consultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again. \"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to go out among the people. They've been informed that your statement wasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people simply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to keep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for the good of the people.\" Michael and Mary were silent. \"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,"}

{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_5#0", "contents": "In their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and waiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and translucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun when they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight. Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far below, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the shoreline of the sea. \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone back into space.\" \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly. He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or anywhere, without you.\" She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael, outside the force walls. We could go far away.\" He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\" \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to it. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and the rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\" \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and looked away from her. \"We're crazy—talking as though we had a choice.\" \"Maybe they'll have to give us a choice.\" \"What're you talking about?\" \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture. Those young bodies that didn't die of old age.\" He waited. \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\" Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket. \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between suffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\" He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long moment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What would it do to them?\" He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know you at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started. Which'll it be, space or Earth?\" \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I—I don't know how to say this.\" He waited, frowning, watching her intently. \"I'm—going to have a child.\" His face went blank. Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the softness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were shining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been running. And suddenly his throat was full. \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\" \"It's true.\" He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside. \"Yes, I can see it is.\" \"I—I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\" He shook his head. \"I don't know—what to—to say. It's so incredible.\" \"Maybe—I got so—tired—just seeing the two of us over and over again and the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that was it. It was just—something I"}

It was just—something I felt I had to do. Some— real life again. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of myself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close to the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the ship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night or morning like we'd seen on Earth—so—so long ago. And then I had to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was something forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed to be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She paused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think—it would be like this.\" \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for three thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history books, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water had to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth and after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies born, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give, for everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the culturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they were soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was stabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think the council could endure what you've done.\" \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\" \"And so this will be just for us .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I remember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go with you out onto the Earth—if we can swing it. When we get outside the city, or if we do—Well, we'll see.\" They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the window and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside him."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_6#0", "contents": "They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking, both knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the giant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush planet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing among the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently like the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the thoughts projected from the screen: \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another expedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope. Everything will be all right.\" Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand years. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it becomes a lie.\" Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands. \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The neglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting their home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller rooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they can't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\" \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these people, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the open sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I die. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I want to be a real part of the Earth again.\" Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now. And then there was the sound of the door opening. They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council chambers."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_7#0", "contents": "Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the faces of the council looking across it like defenders. The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet. The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to set himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one. \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness, \"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you and the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took another swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've changed your report. We've also decided that the people must be protected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did at the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be isolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you are heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has been in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the time when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that hope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent out. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to take your place in our society.\" He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\" \"Yes, there is.\" \"Proceed.\" Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he raised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat. \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of the expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised it. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly and painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't endure.\" The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of desks. \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways of the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces. \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a shaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\" \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were born and haven't died—yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your eyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be horrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and torn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened a long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the sight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\" The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring and muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in anger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and unclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing around"}

Voices cried out, in anger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and unclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing around the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other by the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became very still. Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the President leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering around them in a wide half circle. Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The half circle of people, with the President at its center was moving closer and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white ones and hands were raised to seize them. Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her body and the waiting for death. \"Stop!\" he said quietly. They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back. \"If you want to see us die—just come a step closer.... And remember what'll happen to you.\" The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of muttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to do.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're mad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white ones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who was staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a mirror. \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to—to give me those—lockets! It's your—duty!\" \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To ourselves.\" \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\" \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\" The President's body sagged. \"What—what is it you want?\" Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city. To go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to die a natural death.\" The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and whispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate us.... Like animals.... Get them out of here.... Let them be finished.... Best for us all.... And them....\" There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him forward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing there close together, as though attached. Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth—to die. You will die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or your people again.\" \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\" \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And—supplies.... Yes.\" \"You can give"}

Yes.\" \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range of mountains.\" \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been allowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds of years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the sight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you any longer. Go now. Quickly!\" Michael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the half circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that should sink to the floor."}
{"chunk_id": "THE_VALLEY_8#0", "contents": "It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth that rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The ground car sat still on a crumbling road. Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk into the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way along which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically for the place of salvation. \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you think they'd be with us?\" \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space again—or in prison.\" She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the night over the decaying road. \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\" \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill myself.\" \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward the wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the land?\" He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward, watching the headlights push back the darkness. They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across the bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the desolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat for a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and inflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great pile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless waves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of dust. \"I'm getting out,\" she said. \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said Michael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains and sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in space. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough concentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why? When?\" They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and strolled toward the top of the hill. \"The air smells clean,\" he said. \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did. \"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\" Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me back.\" \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop. He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road somewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\" \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\" He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\" \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been the sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\" He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps"}

There's always been the sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\" He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the dust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly: \"Mary!\" She stopped, whirling around. He was staring down at her feet. She followed his gaze. \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\" She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades. \"They're new,\" he said. They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred object. He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill and stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny patches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a pale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley and there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center. \"Oh!\" Her hand found his. They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch their feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the little spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that trickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They saw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird and saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a bee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the sweetness inside. Mary knelt down and drank from the spring. \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\" \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in his throat. \"From deep down.\" \"We can live here, Michael!\" Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a hill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and plant and you'll have the child.\" \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\" \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime we'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He paused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a way to save them.\" They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time. They felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of the water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and of themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the life that was their own. There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood and picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he had decided"}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] General Finogenov notified Major Winship that the underground blast was scheduled for the following morning. Major Winship, after receiving the message, discussed precautions with the three other Americans. Next morning, before the sunlight exploded, the four of them donned their space suits and went and sat outside the dome, waiting. The sun rose with its bright, silent clap of radiance. Black pools of shadows lay in harsh contrast, their edges drawn with geometric precision. Major Winship attempted unsuccessfully to communicate with Base Gagarin. \"Will you please request the general to keep us informed on the progress of the countdown?\" \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply. \"Help?\" \" Nyet ,\" said Major Winship, exhausting his Russian. \"Count down. Progress. When—boom?\" \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply. \"Boom! Boom!\" said Major Winship in exasperation. \"Boom!\" said Pinov happily. \"When?\" \"Boom—boom!\" said Pinov. \"Oh, nuts.\" Major Winship cut out the circuit. \"They've got Pinov on emergency watch this morning,\" he explained to the other Americans. \"The one that doesn't speak English.\" \"He's done it deliberately,\" said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest of the four Americans. \"How are we going to know when it's over?\" No one bothered to respond. They sat for a while in silence while the shadows evaporated. One by one they clicked on their cooling systems. Ultimately, Lt. Chandler said, \"This is a little ridiculous. I'm going to switch over to their channel. Rap if you want me.\" He sat transfixed for several minutes. \"Ah, it's all Russian. Jabbering away. I can't tell a thing that's going on.\" In the airless void of the moon, the blast itself would be silent. A moth's wing of dust would, perhaps, rise and settle beyond the horizon: no more. \"Static?\" \"Nope.\" \"We'll get static on these things.\" A small infinity seemed to pass very slowly. Major Winship shifted restlessly. \"My reefer's gone on the fritz.\" Perspiration was trickling down his face. \"Let's all go in,\" said the fourth American, Capt. Lawler. \"It's probably over by now.\" \"I'll try again,\" Major Winship said and switched to the emergency channel. \"Base Gagarin? Base Gagarin?\" \"Is Pinov. Help?\" \" Nyet. \" \"Pinov's still there,\" Major Winship said. \"Tell him, 'Help',\" said Capt. Wilkins, \"so he'll get somebody we can talk to.\" \"I'll see them all in hell, first,\" Major Winship said. Five minutes later, the perspiration was rivers across his face. \"This is it,\" he said. \"I'm going in.\" \"Let's all—\" \"No. I've got to cool off.\" \"Hell, Charlie, I feel stupid sitting out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"The shot probably went off an hour ago.\" \"The static level hasn't gone up much, if at all.\" \"Maybe,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"it's buried too deep.\" \"Maybe so,\" Major Winship said. \"But we can't have the dome fall down around all"}

The darkness slowly filled with air, and the temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper moment of pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped into the illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second step when the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward, off balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated beside the radio equipment. The ground moved again. \"Charlie! Charlie!\" \"I'm okay,\" Major Winship answered. \"Okay! Okay!\" \"It's—\" There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased. \"Hey, Les, how's it look?\" Capt. Wilkins asked. \"Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?\" \"Okay,\" Major Winship said. \"We told them this might happen,\" he added bitterly. There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding their breath. \"I guess it's over,\" said Major Winship, getting to his feet. \"Wait a bit more, there may be an after-shock.\" He switched once again to the emergency channel. \"Is Pinov,\" came the supremely relaxed voice. \"Help?\" Major Winship whinnied in disgust. \" Nyet! \" he snarled. To the other Americans: \"Our comrades seem unconcerned.\" \"Tough.\" They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled and snapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at each other. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communications completely. It then abated to something in excess of normal. \"Well,\" Lt. Chandler commented, \"even though we didn't build this thing to withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.\" \"I guess I was just—\" Major Winship began. \"Oh, hell! We're losing pressure. Where's the markers?\" \"By the lug cabinet.\" \"Got 'em,\" Major Winship said a moment later. He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it away and plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed as though it were breathing and then it ruptured. Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply which had cut in automatically with the pressure drop. \"You guys wait. It's on your right side, midway up. I'll try to sheet it.\" He moved for the plastic sheeting. \"We've lost about three feet of calk out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"I can see more ripping loose. You're losing pressure fast at this rate.\" Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. \"How's that?\" \"Not yet.\" \"I don't think I've got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It's sprung a little, and I can't get it to conform over the rivet heads.\" There was a splatter of static. \"Damn!\" Major Winship said, \"they should have made these things more flexible.\" \"Still coming out.\" \"Best I can do.\" Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowly to slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on the floor. \"Come on in,\" he said dryly."}

Electrical cables trailed loosely along the walls and were festooned from the ceiling, radiating from the connections to the outside solar cells. The living space was more restricted than in a submarine, with the bunks jutting out from the walls about six feet from the floor. Lt. Chandler mounted one of the bunks to give them more room. \"Well,\" he said wryly, \"it doesn't smell as bad now.\" \"Oops,\" said Major Winship. \"Just a second. They're coming in.\" He switched over to the emergency channel. It was General Finogenov. \"Major Winship! Hello! Hello, hello, hello. You A Okay?\" \"This is Major Winship.\" \"Oh! Excellent, very good. Any damage, Major?\" \"Little leak. You?\" \"Came through without damage.\" General Finogenov paused a moment. When no comment was forthcoming, he continued: \"Perhaps we built a bit more strongly, Major.\" \"You did this deliberately,\" Major Winship said testily. \"No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Major Winship, please believe me. I very much regret this. Very much so. I am very distressed. Depressed. After repeatedly assuring you there was no danger of a quake—and then to have something like this happen. Oh, this is very embarrassing to me. Is there anything at all we can do?\" \"Just leave us alone, thank you,\" Major Winship said and cut off the communication. \"What'd they say?\" Capt. Wilkins asked. \"Larry, General Finogenov said he was very embarrassed by this.\" \"That's nice,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"I'll be damned surprised,\" Major Winship said, \"if they got any seismic data out of that shot.... Well, to hell with them, let's get this leak fixed. Skip, can you get the calking compound?\" \"Larry, where's the inventory?\" \"Les has got it.\" Lt. Chandler got down from the bunk and Capt. Wilkins mounted. \"Larry,\" Major Winship said, \"why don't you get Earth?\" \"Okay.\" Capt. Wilkins got down from the bunk and Capt. Lawler ascended. \"Got the inventory sheet, Les?\" \"Right here.\" Squeezed in front of the massive transmitter, Capt. Wilkins had energized the circuits. There was a puzzled look on his face. He leaned his helmet against the speaker and then shook his head sadly. \"We can't hear anything without any air.\" Major Winship looked at the microphone. \"Well, I'll just report and—\" He started to pick up the microphone and reconsidered. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That's right, isn't it.\" Capt. Wilkins flicked off the transmitter. \"Some days you don't mine at all,\" he said. \"Les, have you found it?\" \"It's around here somewhere. Supposed to be back here.\" \"Well, find it.\" Lt. Chandler began moving boxes. \"I saw it—\" \"Skip, help look.\" Capt. Lawler got down from the bunk and Major Winship mounted. \"We haven't got all day.\" A few minutes later, Lt.

He traced the leak with a metallic finger. \"How does this stuff work?\" Capt. Lawler asked. They huddled over the instruction sheet. \"Let's see. Squeeze the tube until the diaphragm at the nozzle ruptures. Extrude paste into seam. Allow to harden one hour before service.\" Major Winship said dryly, \"Never mind. I notice it hardens on contact with air.\" Capt. Wilkins lay back on the bunk and stared upward. He said, \"Now that makes a weird kind of sense, doesn't it?\" \"How do they possibly think—?\" \"Gentlemen! It doesn't make any difference,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"Some air must already have leaked into this one. It's hard as a rock. A gorilla couldn't extrude it.\" \"How're the other ones?\" asked Major Winship. Lt. Chandler turned and made a quick examination. \"Oh, they're all hard, too.\" \"Who was supposed to check?\" demanded Capt. Wilkins in exasperation. \"The only way you can check is to extrude it,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"and if it does extrude, you've ruined it.\" \"That's that,\" Major Winship said. \"There's nothing for it but to yell help.\" II Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler took the land car to Base Gagarin. The Soviet base was situated some ten miles toward sunset at the bottom of a natural fold in the surface. The route was moderately direct to the tip of the gently rolling ridge. At that point, the best pathway angled left and made an S-shaped descent to the basin. It was a one-way trip of approximately thirty exhausting minutes. Major Winship, with his deficient reefer, remained behind. Capt. Wilkins stayed for company. \"I want a cigarette in the worst way,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"So do I, Larry. Shouldn't be more than a couple of hours. Unless something else goes wrong.\" \"As long as they'll loan us the calking compound,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Yeah, yeah,\" Major Winship said. \"Let's eat.\" \"You got any concentrate? I'm empty.\" \"I'll load you,\" Capt. Wilkins volunteered wearily. It was an awkward operation that took several minutes. Capt. Wilkins cursed twice during the operation. \"I'd hate to live in this thing for any period.\" \"I think these suits are one thing we've got over the Russians,\" Major Winship said. \"I don't see how they can manipulate those bulky pieces of junk around.\" They ate. \"Really horrible stuff.\" \"Nutritious.\" After the meal, Major Winship said reflectively, \"Now I'd like a cup of hot tea.

Fifty pounds more or less—\" \"They've got the power-plants for it.\" \"Do you think he did that deliberately?\" Major Winship asked. \"I think he's trying to force us off. I think he hoped for the quake. Gagarin's built to take it, I'll say that. Looks like it, anyhow. You don't suppose they planned this all along?

Like a little kid.\" \"Maybe they don't make aluminum desks.\" \"They've—got—aluminum. Half of everything on the whole planet is aluminum. You know they're just showing off.\" \"Let me wire you up,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"We ought to report.\" \"That's going to take awhile.\" \"It's something to do while we wait.\" \"I guess we ought to.\" Major Winship came down from the bunk and sat with his back toward the transmitter. Capt. Wilkins slewed the equipment around until the emergency jacks were accessible. He unearthed the appropriate cable and began unscrewing the exterior plate to the small transmitter-receiver set on Major Winship's back. Eventually, trailing wires, Major Winship was coupled into the network. \"Okay?\" \"Okay,\" Major Winship gestured. They roused Earth. \"This is Major Charles Winship, Commanding Officer, Freedom 19, the American moonbase.\" At this point, Major Winship observed for the first time that he was now on emergency air. He started to ask Capt. Wilkins to change his air bottle, but then he realized his communications were cut off. He reached over and rapped Capt. Wilkins' helmet. \"This is the Cape. Come in, Major Winship.\" \"Just a moment.\" \"Is everything all right?\" Major Winship was squirming nervously, obviously perturbed. \"A-Okay,\" he said. \"Just a moment.\" \"What's wrong?\" came the worried question. In the background, he heard someone say, \"I think there's something wrong.\" Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in a savage grimace. Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to face through their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrously large to the other. Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. One arm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winship could no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effort was not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry in involuntary realism. This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth. Capt. Wilkins's lips were desperately forming the word \"Leak?\" Air, Major Winship said silently. Leak? Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Winning_of_the_Moon_5#0", "contents": "Comprehension dawned. Capt. Wilkins nodded and started to turn away. Major Winship caught his arm and nodded his head toward the loose jack. Oh. Capt. Wilkins nodded and smiled. He reached across and plugged the speaker in again. \"... Freedom 19! Hello, Freedom 19! Come in!\" \"We're here,\" Major Winship said. \"All right? Are you all right?\" \"We're all right. A-Okay.\" Major Winship, mindful of the extent of his potential audience, took a deep breath. \"Earlier this morning, the Soviet Union fired an underground atomic device for the ostensible purpose of investigating the composition of the lunar mass by means of seismic analysis of the resultant shock waves. This was done in spite of American warnings that such a disturbance might release accumulated stresses in the long undisturbed satellite, and was done in the face of vigorous American protests.\" Capt. Wilkins tapped his helmet and gestured for him to swivel around. The turn was uncomfortably tight and complicated by the restraining cables. Capt. Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle. \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued. \"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to withstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface. No personnel were injured and there was no equipment damage.\" Capt. Wilkins tapped his shoulder to indicate the new air bottle was being inserted. Another tap indicated it was seated. Major Winship flicked the appropriate chest button and nodded in appreciation. \"However,\" he continued, \"we did experience a minor leak in the dome, which is presently being repaired.\" \"The Soviet Union,\" came the reply, \"has reported the disturbance and has tendered their official apology. You want it?\" \"It can wait until later. Send it by mail for all I care. Vacuum has destroyed our organic air reconditioner. We have approximately three weeks of emergency air. However, Base Gagarin reports no damage, so that, in the event we exhaust our air, we will be able to obtain the necessary replacement.\" The wait of a little better than three seconds for the response gave the conversation a tone of deliberation. A new voice came on. \"We tried to contact you earlier, Major. We will be able to deliver replacements in about ten days.\" \"I will forward a coded report on the occurrence,\" Major Winship said. \"Let us hear from you again in ... about three hours. Is the leak repaired?\" \"The leak has not yet been repaired. Over and out.\" He nodded to Capt. Wilkins and leaned back. Methodically, Capt. Wilkins set about disconnecting the major from the transmitter. \"Wow!\" said Major Winship when he was once more in communication. \"For a moment there, I thought....\" \"What?\" Capt. Wilkins asked with interest. \"I could see myself asking them to ask the Russians to ask Finogenov to get on the emergency channel to ask you to charge the air bottle. I never felt so ... idiotic is not quite strong enough ... there for a minute in my whole life. I didn't know how much emergency air was left, and I thought, my God, I'll never live"}

All the hams in the world listening, while I try to explain the situation. I could see the nickname being entered in my files: aka. The Airless Idiot. I tell you, that was rough.\" III Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler returned with the calking compound. It occupied the rear section of the land car. Lt. Chandler sat atop it. It was a fifty-five gallon drum. The airlock to Freedom 19 was open. \"What is that ?\" asked Major Winship, squinting out into the glaring sunlight. \"That,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"is the calking compound.\" \"You're kidding,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I am not kidding.\" Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler came inside. Capt. Wilkins mounted a bunk. \"Why didn't you just borrow a cupful?\" Major Winship said sarcastically. \"It's this way,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"They didn't have anything but 55-gallon drums of it.\" \"Oh, my,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I suppose it's a steel drum. Those things must weigh....\" \"Actually, I think you guys have got the general wrong,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"He was out, himself, to greet us. I think he was really quite upset by the quake. Probably because his people had misfigured so bad.\" \"He's too damned suspicious,\" Major Winship said. \"You know and I know why they set that blast off. I tried to tell him. Hell. He looks at me like an emasculated owl and wants to know our ulterior motive in trying to prevent a purely scientific experiment, the results of which will be published in the technical press for the good of everybody. I'll bet!\" \"About this drum,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Well, like I said, it's this way,\" Lt. Chandler resumed. \"I told him we needed about a pint. Maybe a quart. But this stuff you have to mix up. He only had these drums. There's two parts to it, and you have to combine them in just the right proportion. He told me to take a little scale—\" \"A little scale?\" asked Capt. Wilkins, rolling his eyes at the dome. \"That's what I told him. We don't have any little scale.\" \"Yeah,\" said Captain Lawler, \"and he looked at us with that mute, surprised look, like everybody, everywhere has dozens of little scales.\" \"Well, anyway,\" Lt. Chandler continued, \"he told us just to mix up the whole fifty-five gallon drum. There's a little bucket of stuff that goes in, and it's measured just right. We can throw away what we don't need.\" \"Somehow, that sounds like him,\" Major Winship said. \"He had five or six of them.\" \"Jesus!\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"That must be three thousand"}

It's supposed to be mixed thoroughly.\" They thought over the problem for a while. \"That will be a man-sized job,\" Major Winship said. \"Let's see, Charlie. Maybe not too bad,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"If I took the compressor motor, we could make up a shaft and ... let's see ... if we could....\""}
{"chunk_id": "The_Winning_of_the_Moon_6#0", "contents": "It took the better part of an hour to rig up the electric mixer. Capt. Wilkins was profusely congratulated. \"Now,\" Major Winship said, \"we can either bring the drum inside or take the mixer out there.\" \"We're going to have to bring the drum in,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Well,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"that will make it nice and cozy.\" It took the four of them to roll the drum inside, rocking it back and forth through the airlock. At that time, it was apparent the table was interposing itself. Lt. Chandler tried to dismantle the table. \"Damn these suits,\" he said. \"You've got it stuck between the bunk post.\" \"I know that.\" \"I don't think this is the way to do it,\" Major Winship said. \"Let's back the drum out.\" Reluctantly, they backed the drum out and deposited it. With the aid of Capt. Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the table unstuck. They passed it over to Major Winship, who handed it out to Capt. Wilkins. Captain Wilkins carried it around the drum of calking compound and set it down. It rested uneasily on the uneven surface. \"Now, let's go,\" said Major Winship. Eventually, they accomplished the moving. They wedged the drum between the main air-supply tank and the transmitter. They were all perspiring. \"It's not the weight, it's the mass,\" said Capt. Wilkins brightly. \"The hell it isn't the weight,\" said Lt. Chandler. \"That's heavy.\" \"With my reefer out,\" said Major Winship, \"I'm the one it's rough on.\" He shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"They should figure a way to get a mop in here, or a towel, or a sponge, or something. I'll bet you've forgotten how much sweat stings in the eyes.\" \"It's the salt.\" \"Speaking of salt. I wish I had some salt tablets,\" Major Winship said. \"I've never sweat so much since basic.\" \"Want to bet Finogenov hasn't got a bushel of them?\" \"No!\" Major Winship snapped."}
{"chunk_id": "The_Winning_of_the_Moon_7#0", "contents": "With the drum of calking compound inside, both Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler retreated to the bunks. Capt. Wilkins maneuvered the mixing attachment. \"I feel crowded,\" he said. \"Cozy's the word.\" \"Watch it! Watch it! You almost hit me in the face plate with that!\" \"Sorry.\" At length the mixer was in operation in the drum. \"Works perfectly,\" said Capt. Wilkins proudly. \"Now what, Skip? The instructions aren't in English.\" \"You're supposed to dump the bucket of stuff in. Then clean the area thoroughly around the leak.\" \"With what?\" asked Major Winship. \"Sandpaper, I guess.\" \"With sandpaper?\" Major Winship said, emptying the bucket of fluid into the drum. \"We don't have any sandpaper.\" \"It's been a long day,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Mix it thoroughly,\" Lt. Chandler mused. \"I guess that means let it mix for about ten minutes or so. Then you apply it. It sets for service in just a little bit, Finogenov said. An hour or so, maybe.\" \"I hope this doesn't set on exposure to air.\" \"No,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"It sets by some kind of chemical action. General Finogenov wasn't sure of the English name for it. Some kind of plastic.\" \"Let's come back to how we're going to clean around the leak,\" Major Winship said. \"Say, I—\" interrupted Capt. Wilkins. There was a trace of concern in his voice. \"This is a hell of a time for this to occur to me. I just wasn't thinking, before. You don't suppose it's a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, do you? \" \"Larry,\" said Major Winship, \"I wouldn't know a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin from—\" \"Hey!\" exclaimed Capt. Wilkins. \"The mixer's stopped.\" He bent forward and touched the drum. He jerked back. \"Ye Gods! that's hot! And it's harder than a rock! It is an epoxy! Let's get out of here.\" \"Huh?\" \"Out! Out!\" Major Winship, Lt. Chandler, and Capt. Lawler, recognizing the sense of urgency, simultaneously glanced at the drum. It was glowing cherry red. \"Let's go!\" Capt. Wilkins said. He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became temporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly in the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the necessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them from behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms and legs. At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right. The table remained untouched. When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off like shrapnel.\" They obeyed. \"What—what—what?\" Capt. Lawler stuttered. They were still separated, two on one side of the airlock, two on the other. \"I'm going to try to look,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Let me go.\" He lumbered directly away from the dome for a distance of about fifteen feet, then turned and positioned himself, some five feet behind the table, on a line of sight with the airlock. \"I can see it,\" he said. \"It's getting redder. It's ... it's ... melting, yes. Melting down at"}

I'm afraid ... it's weakening it.... Redder. Oh, oh.\" \"What?\" said Capt. Lawler. \"Watch out! There. There! \" Capt. Wilkins leaped from his position. He was still floating toward the ground when there was an incredibly bright flare from inside the dome, and a great, silent tongue of flame lashed through the airlock and rolled across the lunar surface. The table was sent tumbling. The flame was gone almost instantly. \"There went the air,\" Capt. Lawler commented. \"We got T-Trouble,\" said Lt. Chandler."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Poor Butcher suffered more than any dictator in history: everybody gave in to him because he was so puny and they were so impregnable! From the other end of the Avenue of Wisdom that led across the Peace Park, a gray, hairless, heavily built dog was barking soundlessly at the towering crystal glory of the Time Theater. For a moment, the effect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of civilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up with the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the scene was normal again. The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied the dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and poked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his grip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony pavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip and suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff tube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an upside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long black tongue lolled. The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube with a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone called: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\" A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the luxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that, except for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog. Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice: \"Kill 'em, Brute.\""}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_2#0", "contents": "The gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks so short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a fanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and one pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard. Butch yawned. \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog fights, Butch.\" \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I don't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else. Nobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you talk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\" \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the judiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All right, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people were hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\" \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back skeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed up his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He squeaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight. \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't break anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose. Can't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that when he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.\" \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice acquired from a robot adolescer. \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the Butcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than anything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\" \"What's a garbage pail?\" \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\" The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear and was whirling him around hilariously. \"Aw, quit it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance. Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no attention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight. The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much of a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\""}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_3#0", "contents": "He kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet. \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would you?\" \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded scathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits and a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with guarded wistfulness. \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is programmed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically has racial memory.\" \"I mean if you could hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended. \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut up—I want to think.\" \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness. The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he said slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\" \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\" \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet you didn't.\" \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All newborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless. They have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death games and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult conditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why, long after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people kept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them differently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's greatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all violent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\" \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a sissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we were attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\" \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's what it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to problems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to viruses.\" \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\" \"They can't. It's impossible.\" \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\" \"You've never been inside the Time Theater—you're not old enough yet—so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons why it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time Bubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into the past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't change the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\" \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to have warfare when I'm World Director.\" \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him. \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\" \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll have an altogether different opinion when you're six.\" \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to keep telling me about it, do you?\""}

{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4#0", "contents": "The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly on the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said in soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time Theater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\" Butch scowled. \"How about it, Butch?\" Still Butch did not seem to hear. The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?\" The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You said so yourself.\" \"You could walk us over there.\" \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\" \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\" Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging pocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a black mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS. He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups wanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up or tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the crayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF THE GRASS. With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the others. Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at shoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a wide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes avoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking up inquiringly at his master. \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy ignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\" \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of his broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher climbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during which each boy accused the other of trying to upset them. Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along securely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after his master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few minutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to climb the hemispherical repulsor field. Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the Avenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he was about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away."}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_5#0", "contents": "It was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking and quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor hemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would be nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the simplest way to make progress. The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were among the most prized of toys. \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced. \"I know ,\" the Butcher said irritably. But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp to the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god realized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to the adults drifting up and down the ramp. \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly as he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're viewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D. time scale. It should be interesting.\" \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A red-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair had fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat Joggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the grim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era. \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said. \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the skulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the Navies.\" Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even if it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\" \"They won't let me in, either.\" \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\" \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully. \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the difference.\" Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their feet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened his mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in tight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he thought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy. Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which drank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher limped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his battle injury."}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_6#0", "contents": "Hal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\" The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to think old.\" \"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives simply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for it—something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\" \"Why?\" \"I don't exactly know, but something.\" \"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and have some excitement.\" \"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away from your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics or something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take care of you.\" \"Shut up—I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them, contorting his face diabolically. Hal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor. Obediently four of them lined up. But Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a deeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to retreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed back to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound issued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other uninjes moved uneasily. \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy whispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\" \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably. \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still fixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed. The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely electrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back. The Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall. \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said. The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then bounced him back with equal force. \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving up, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell how old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you through a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the usher.\""}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_7#0", "contents": "But the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and then sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and growled faintly down the corridor. \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think Tamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\" Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the usher as if it weren't there. The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips. There were two closely spaced faint plops and a large green stain appeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from the close-cropped hair of the other. They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms folded and wasn't looking at them. Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the main entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found themselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch the show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their levitators, laid them on the floor and sat down. The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central platform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat flattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the bubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale central glow. But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of the boys. Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the bubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage appeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble, a ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a little fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about were wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond beards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather. Here and there were scattered weapons and armor—long swords glistening with oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and helmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean, wolflike dogs paced with restless monotony."}

Only the hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder and fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant. \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric cultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that Joggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply, whispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that, Joggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development and hears our questions and then it automats background and answers. But it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion microtapes, though.\" The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time in the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived by pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We believe it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces of nature and see into the future.\" Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the other side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\" \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he knew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light, can get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of the bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other way—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the way. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\" Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's a kind of hole through time?\" \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the locus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two points in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely open, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would an atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain the bubble, let alone maneuver it.\" \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light, why can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\" \"Why—er—you see, Joggy—\" The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way for matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward you, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the opposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked away along the vista down which they are peering.\""}

{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9#0", "contents": "As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on their side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For an instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing silhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the bubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the back of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on the other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some time. He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag. \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice cut in. Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the cubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while mopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other. Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\" But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble. \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble, if the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward us, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light coming our way disappear, too?\" \"Well—you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's—\" Once more the interpreter helped him out. \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of one element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's more than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light tends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the light goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience. But one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the Time Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater, you haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're getting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no isotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are being made to synthesize them.\" \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs are always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\" \" I like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut anybody yet with those choppers?\" Hal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\" \"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\" \"But how did you get in—Butcher?\""}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_10#0", "contents": "The Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it certainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes of carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater and just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but then my sprained ankle had got worse—I kind of tried to get up and fell down again—so he picked me up and carried me right through the usher.\" \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You tricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed yours, going through the usher. I really have heard it's dangerous for you under-fives to be in here.\" \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls commented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew to the far end of the cubicle. The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on the scene in the Time Bubble. \"Those big dogs—\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\" \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble. Smells haven't any isotopes and—\" \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out someday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\" \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's all the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real at all, but a—uh—\" \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking of the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some scientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and that the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but ever-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is only a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used for time traveling—just as it may be a similar disability that keeps a robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real man or animal. \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and other beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time Theater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should prove true—and no evidence for it has ever appeared—there are automatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible, remember) in either direction.\" \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment."}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_11#0", "contents": "\"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired. The Butcher folded his arms and scowled. The interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a quarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a qualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\" There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble had acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up their swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back, revealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be looking straight out of the bubble at the future. \"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of his seat. \"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously. \"Hah!\" The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of smoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved wildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The warriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the sorcerer. \"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\" \"Butcher!\" Hal admonished. Suddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone forth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down. \"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be necessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\" In a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed at one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he must cross-section. \"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged. Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the shadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs. \"Oh, boy !\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy. \"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast. \"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the bubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\" \"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the safeguards!\""}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_12#0", "contents": "The warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the one who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about, pushing them in his direction. Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged from the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth. \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said. A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row of the audience. The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step forward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his left shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his right hand. \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\" the interpreter enjoined. In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the Butcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the floor and darted out through the sphincter. Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged warriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between their legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled. Then the warriors began to fan out. \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the interpreter said. \"Please be patient.\" At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a levitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At his heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization voice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey, you! You quit that!\" The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to quiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his sword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range. Then his sword swished down in a flashing arc. Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring at him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible an arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed a step. The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and digging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic 'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie and Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth."}
{"chunk_id": "TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_13#0", "contents": "Growling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves forward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first encounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and tossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But then Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the face of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and touched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror. The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But already the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had the advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many foxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj clamped on a throat, that throat was torn out. Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the warriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully. That was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand clenching the levitator above his head. \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\" The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately, a half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher. \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in mechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\" The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than flesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They came yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle. He dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a screech. Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the Butcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew back, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs. At their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time Bubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted no time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and no repulsor field stayed them. \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled."}

Thank you for your patience.\" Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his arms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The Butcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted. \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always playing hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come from those dirty past men.\" Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening to them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of reality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute licked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically on his mouth. He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We came, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\""}

FYFE [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Johnny Tolliver scowled across the desk at his superior. His black thatch was ruffled, as if he had been rubbed the wrong way. \"I didn't ask you to cut out your own graft, did I?\" he demanded. \"Just don't try to sucker me in on the deal. I know you're operating something sneaky all through the colony, but it's not for me.\" The big moon-face of Jeffers, manager of the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways, glowered back at him. Its reddish tinge brightened the office noticeably, for such of Ganymede's surface as could be seen through the transparent dome outside the office window was cold, dim and rugged. The glowing semi-disk of Jupiter was more than half a million miles distant. \"Try not to be simple—for once!\" growled Jeffers. \"A little percentage here and there on the cargoes never shows by the time figures get back to Earth. The big jets in the home office don't care. They count it on the estimates.\" \"You asked any of them lately?\" Tolliver prodded. \"Now, listen ! Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the mines and the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in the beginning, most of them. They know what it's like. D'ya think they don't expect us to make what we can on the side?\" Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blue uniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly. \"You just don't listen to me ,\" he complained. \"You know I took this piloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degree back on Earth. I only want to finish my year—not get into something I can't quit.\" Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk of his body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers. \"Aw, it's not like that,\" the manager muttered. \"You can ease out whenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on your account?\" Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meeting his eye. \"All right, then!\" Jeffers snapped after a long moment. \"If you want it that way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!\" \"You can't fire me,\" retorted the pilot pityingly. \"I came out here on a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred for hazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?\" \"Okay I can't fire you legally—as long as you report for work,\" grumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. \"We'll see how long you keep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit in your quarters and see if the company calls that hazardous duty!\" \"Doesn't"}

Looks like a little vacation , he thought, unperturbed. He'll come around. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffers and his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It's their risk."}
{"chunk_id": "TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_2#0", "contents": "Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was \"Tuesday\" by the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-long journey around Jupiter. His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected to specify the type of craft to be piloted. On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the number of one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and the spaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes. He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around the garage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domes seemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles. The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore when he found the assignment unchanged by \"Friday.\" Even the reflection that it was payday was small consolation. \"Hey, Johnny!\" said a voice at his shoulder. \"The word is that they're finally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\" Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver. \"What do you mean?\" \"They say some home-office relative is coming in on the Javelin .\" \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Tolliver. \"Outside of the way they keep handing out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.\" \"Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go back to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason but them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy orbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!\" Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a portable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's airlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags into the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at the waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged. She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even in stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too blonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap apparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy sweater, like a spacer. \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said, sliding into the seat beside Tolliver. \"By the way, just call me Betty.\" \"Sure,\" agreed Tolliver thinking, Ohmigod! Trying already to be just one of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer, or does he just know where bodies are buried? \"They were making dates,\" said the girl. \"Were they ribbing me, or is it true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?\" \"It's true enough,\" Tolliver assured her. \"We need people out here, and it costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded ships by 'automatic' flight—that is, a long, slow, economical orbit and automatic signalling equipment.

Then he headed the tractor across the frozen surface of Ganymede toward the permanent domes of the city. \"How is it here?\" asked the girl. \"They told me it's pretty rough.\" \"What did you expect?\" asked Tolliver. \"Square dances with champagne?\" \"Don't be silly. Daddy says I'm supposed to learn traffic routing and the business management of a local branch. They probably won't let me see much else.\" \"You never can tell,\" said the pilot, yielding to temptation. \"Any square inch of Ganymede is likely to be dangerous.\" I'll be sorry later , he reflected, but if Jeffers keeps me jockeying this creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl is trying too hard to sound like one of the gang. \"Yeah,\" he went on, \"right now, I don't do a thing but drive missions from the city to the spaceport.\" \"Missions! You call driving a mile or so a mission ?\" Tolliver pursed his lips and put on a shrewd expression. \"Don't sneer at Ganymede, honey!\" he warned portentously. \"Many a man who did isn't here today. Take the fellow who used to drive this mission!\" \"You can call me Betty. What happened to him?\" \"I'll tell you some day,\" Tolliver promised darkly. \"This moon can strike like a vicious animal.\" \"Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!\" \"I was thinking of the mountain slides,\" said the pilot. \"Not to mention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where you'd least expect. That's why I draw such high pay for driving an unarmored tractor.\" \"You use armored vehicles?\" gasped the girl. She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver deliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity, the tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch. \"Those slides,\" he continued. \"Ganymede's only about the size of Mercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up at steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come at you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it barrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If you're in the way—well, it's just too bad!\" Say, that's pretty good! he told himself. What a liar you are, Tolliver! He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite, taking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John Tolliver, driver of \"missions\" across the menacing wastes between dome and port. In the end, he displayed conclusive evidence in the form of the weekly paycheck he had received that morning. It did not, naturally, indicate he was drawing the salary of a space pilot. Betty looked thoughtful. \"I'm retiring in six months if I'm still alive,\" he said bravely, edging the tractor into the airlock at their destination. \"Made my pile.

That's all, Tolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow—the president, that is: your father—sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor to show you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?\" \"Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers,\" snapped the girl, in a tone new to Tolliver. \"We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already had enough rope.\" Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His loose lips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. The pilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the elder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he had told en route from the spaceport. \"Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow?\" Jeffers stammered. He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver. \"Mr. Jeffers,\" said the girl, \"I may look like just another spoiled little blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday. I was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something about holding on to it.\" Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older. Jeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl. \"Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, when he told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede. I have some authority, though. And you look like the source of the trouble to me.\" \"You can't prove anything,\" declared Jeffers hoarsely. \"Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest won't be hard to find. Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good as fired!\" The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly at Betty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about \"just landed.\" After a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab an intercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other end to come in without a countdown. Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to be a secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers' headquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief, and guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were large enough. \"No stupid questions!\" Jeffers ordered. \"Lock these two up while I think!\" Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off. \"Where should we lock—?\" the fellow paused to ask. Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling that it was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.

The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of departing footsteps and then by silence. After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up. He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his left ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily. \"I'm sorry about that,\" murmured Betty. Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he in a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him anyway. \"I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,\" remarked the girl. \"Thanks for letting me know in time,\" said Tolliver. The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see well enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him. \"What can we use to get out of here?\" he mused. \"Why should we try?\" asked the girl. \"What can he do?\" \"You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?\" \"Your paycheck,\" said Betty. \"As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount, it was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here. It had to be Jeffers.\" Tolliver groaned. \"Then, on the way over here, he as good as admitted everything. You didn't hear him, I guess. Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and seemed to blame you for it.\" \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or smuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to get out of here—before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal accident!\" \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after a startled pause. \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are rumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells things to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by claiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him that bad over a little slack managing?\" The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters building, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet. There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a dozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of discarded records. \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered. He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile at the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter. \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern. \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough heat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\" He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with"}

If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\" He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers. \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here. He can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by yourself.\" \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl. \"No, I don't think you'd better.\" \"Why not?\" \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to the daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a lot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\" \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking determined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\" Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to give slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his heel hard at the corner below the hinge. The plastic yielded. \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl through!\""}
{"chunk_id": "TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_6#0", "contents": "Hardly sixty seconds later, he led her into a maze of stacked crates in the warehouse proper. The building was not much longer than wide, for each of the structures in the colony had its own hemispherical emergency dome of transparent plastic. They soon reached the other end. \"I think there's a storeroom for spacesuits around here,\" muttered Tolliver. \"Why do you want them?\" \"Honey, I just don't think it will be so easy to lay hands on a tractor. I bet Jeffers already phoned the garage and all the airlocks with some good lie that will keep me from getting through.\" After a brief search, he located the spacesuits. Many, evidently intended for replacements, had never been unpacked, but there were a dozen or so serviced and standing ready for emergencies. He showed Betty how to climb into one, and checked her seals and valves after donning a suit himself. \"That switch under your chin,\" he said, touching helmets so she could hear him. \"Leave it turned off. Anybody might be listening!\" He led the way out a rear door of the warehouse. With the heavy knife that was standard suit equipment, he deliberately slashed a four-foot square section out of the dome. He motioned to Betty to step through, then trailed along with the plastic under his arm. He caught up and touched helmets again. \"Just act as if you're on business,\" he told her. \"For all anyone can see, we might be inspecting the dome.\" \"Where are you going?\" asked Betty. \"Right through the wall, and then head for the nearest mine. Jeffers can't be running everything !\" \"Is there any way to get to a TV?\" asked the girl. \"I ... uh ... Daddy gave me a good number to call if I needed help.\" \"How good?\" \"Pretty official, as a matter of fact.\" \"All right,\" Tolliver decided. \"We'll try the ship you just came in on. They might have finished refueling and left her empty.\" They had to cross one open lane between buildings, and Tolliver was very conscious of moving figures in the distance; but no one seemed to look their way. Reaching the foot of the main dome over the establishment, he glanced furtively about, then plunged his knife into the transparent material. From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Betty make a startled gesture, but he had his work cut out for him. This was tougher than the interior dome. Finally, he managed to saw a ragged slit through which they could squeeze. There was room to walk between the inner and outer layer, so he moved along a few yards. A little dust began to blow about where they had gone through. He touched helmets once more. \"This time,\" he said, \"the air will really start to blow, so get through as fast as you can. If I can slap this piece of plastic over the rip, it may stow down the loss of pressure enough to give us quite a lead before the alarms go off.\" Through the faceplates,"}

As soon as he plunged the knife into the outer layer, he could see dusty, moist air puffing out into the near-vacuum of Ganymede's surface. Fumbling, he cut as fast as he could and shoved Betty through the small opening. Squeezing through in his turn, he left one arm inside to spread the plastic sheet as best he could. The internal air pressure slapped it against the inside of the dome as if glued, although it immediately showed an alarming tendency to balloon through the ruptured spot. They'll find it, all right , Tolliver reminded himself. Don't be here when they do! He grabbed Betty by the wrist of her spacesuit and headed for the nearest outcropping of rock. It promptly developed that she had something to learn about running on ice in such low gravity. Until they were out of direct line of sight from the settlement, Tolliver simply dragged her. Then, when he decided that it was safe enough to pause and tell her how to manage better, the sight of her outraged scowl through the face-plate made him think better of it. By the time we reach the ship, she'll have learned , he consoled himself."}
{"chunk_id": "TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_7#0", "contents": "It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on Ganymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced to explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He admitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the spaceship. There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed and stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed. \"That's all right,\" Tolliver told the girl. \"We can get in with no trouble.\" It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that he caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the spot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized the outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting downward again. \"In fact, we have to get in to stay out of trouble,\" he said to Betty. He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated the mechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder. It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder and inside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting at the time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and then Tolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was a clumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time. In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat, glanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet. \"Leave the suit on,\" he ordered, getting in the first word while she was still shaking her head. \"It will help a little on the takeoff.\" \"Takeoff!\" shrilled Betty. \"What do you think you're going to do? I just want to use the radio or TV!\" \"That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your conversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these dials!\" He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the ship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an economy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments, doing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He warned her the trip might be long. \"I told you not to come,\" he said at last. \"Now sit back!\" He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process. In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck, and then it was out of his hands for several minutes. \"That wasn't so bad,\" Betty admitted some time later. \"Did you go in the right direction?\" \"Who knows?\" retorted Tolliver. \"There wasn't time to check everything . We'll worry about that after we make your call.\" \"Oh!\" Betty looked helpless. \"It's in my pocket.\" Tolliver sighed.

In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry her out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any further help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter. When Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about making contact. It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored expectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a uniform. \"Space Patrol?\" whispered Tolliver incredulously. \"That's right,\" said Betty. \"Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.\" Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out of range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared exasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who could arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede and wondering what was behind it all. When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers and reporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began to suspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the Patrolman."}
{"chunk_id": "TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_8#0", "contents": "For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, he never addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted the request as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who to go down after. They really sent her out to nail someone , Tolliver realized. Of course, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had an idea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She might have got me killed! \"We do have one trouble,\" he heard Betty saying. \"This tractor driver, Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but he says it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever they call it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.\" Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of her sweater. \"Actually, I have a fine idea,\" he informed the officer coldly. \"I happen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control. If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us later on this channel.\" \"Miss Koslow?\" repeated the spacer. \"Did she tell you—well, no matter! If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.\" He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offended than reassured at discovering his status. \"This 'Miss Koslow' business,\" he said suspiciously. \"He sounded funny about that.\" The girl grinned. \"Relax, Tolliver,\" she told him. \"Did you really believe Daddy would send his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoever was gypping him?\" \"You ... you...?\" \"Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigating firm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate—\" \"I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,\" Tolliver finished for her. \"I guess it's better this way,\" he said meditatively a moment later. \"Oh, come on ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we're going?\" \"I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, so we'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to be picked up.\" He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuel necessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Even though the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing along enough fuel to head back would be something else again. \"We'll just have to ride it out,\" he said sympathetically. \"The ship is provisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.\" \"I didn't expect to so soon.\" \"Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crack the case in about three hours on Ganymede.\" \"Great!\" muttered Betty. \"What a lucky girl I am!\" \"Yes,\" admitted Tolliver, \"there are problems. If you like, we might get the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.\" \"I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet,\" she commented sourly."}

But cook? Sorry.\" \"Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.\" \"I'll think about it,\" promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at the deck. Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about it too. After a while , he promised himself, I'll explain how I cut the fuel flow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're just orbiting Ganymede!"}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] The audiophone buzzed thrice—one long, followed by two shorts—and Isobar Jones pressed the stud activating its glowing scanner-disc. \"Hummm?\" he said absent-mindedly. The selenoplate glowed faintly, and the image of the Dome Commander appeared. \"Report ready, Jones?\" \"Almost,\" acknowledged Isobar gloomily. \"It prob'ly ain't right, though. How anybody can be expected to get anything right on this dagnabbed hunk o' green cheese—\" \"Send it up,\" interrupted Colonel Eagan, \"as soon as you can. Sparks is making Terra contact now. That is all.\" \"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag—?\" It was all , so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking to himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to his duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which, six months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed: Cond. of Obs. He noted the proper figures under the headings Sun Spots : Max Freq. — Min. Freq. ; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red ink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work sheet. This done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer, frowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and began writing. \" Weather forecast for Terra ,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching sounds. The audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered without looking. \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple o' minutes. Keep your pants on!\" \"I—er—I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice. Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He blinked nervously. \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \" You , Miss Sally! Golly—'scuse me! I didn't realize—\" The Dome Commander's niece giggled. \"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather in Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki, but I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\" \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally. Fine sunshiny weather. You can go.\" \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\" \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work. South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa.

His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for six tedious Earth months, beneath the impervite hemisphere of Lunar III—that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point and meteorological base. \"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up in an airtight Dome like—like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight? Oh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not burn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a toad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented, reoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units. Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he signed on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine existence. \"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the stummick. Not even allowed to—Yeah?\" It was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said, \"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\" \"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\" \"O.Q. But just bring it . Nothing else.\" Isobar bridled. \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\" \"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of yours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\" Isobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I guess I can play it if I want to—\" \"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in my cubby! I've got sensitive eardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling quick today. Big doings up here.\" \"Yeah? What?\" \"Well, it's Roberts and Brown—\" \"What about 'em?\" \"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\" \"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully. \"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe—if they should meet any Grannies. Well, scoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\" \"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his cloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome. He didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered. Instead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally turned to him in sheer exasperation. \"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your britches?\" Isobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean—Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe you wouldn't mind if I—well—er—\" \"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's open, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\" He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of incomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before him cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating with painstaking clarity: \"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me, Luna?

Go on ask him!\" \"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked startled. \"How's that? I didn't say a word—\" \"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope!

But I don't understand—\" The silver platter which had mirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the inconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun briefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly landscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green trees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ... people.... \"Enough?\" asked Sparks. Isobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he nodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other radioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\" \"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out. \"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar. \"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \" He twisted the mike; not me. But—how come you always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open, Jonesy? Homesick?\" \"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily. \"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six months at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only make you feel worse to see Earth.\" \"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's—well, it's the things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and trees.\" Sparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin. \"We've got them right here on Luna. Go look out the tower window, Jonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest, greenest little valley you ever saw.\" \"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse.

By order of the Dome Commander ,' That means you, Jones!\" \"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to play my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good music, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me—\" \"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning system which can't be shut off.

You cannot disrupt our entire organization for your own—er—amusement.\" \"But—\" said Isobar. \"No!\" Isobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already. If now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last amusement which lightened his moments of freedom— \"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother nobody. I'll go Outside and play it—\" \"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about the Grannies?\" Isobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life found by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an abbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar exployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was an understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low intelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and implacable foe. Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever yet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science was completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of Graniteback physiology—but it was known, from bitter experience, that the carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be penetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame, by electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered atomo-needle dispenser. All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet: \"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for a 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back inside—\" \"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely, no ! I have no time for such nonsense. You know the orders—obey them! And now, gentlemen, good afternoon!\" He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning. \"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish—hey, Jonesy?

{"chunk_id": "TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_4#1", "contents": "no ! I have no time for such nonsense. You know the orders—obey them! And now, gentlemen, good afternoon!\" He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning. \"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish—hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play your doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the awful screeching wails—\" But Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect fury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from his lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked startled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent profanity. \"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust! Oh— fiddlesticks !\" II \"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot oven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\" Some minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr. Loesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man nodded commiseratingly. \"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not altogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our poor Isobar.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit homesick now and then. He ought to learn to—\" \"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle, \"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something deeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call: weltschmertz . There is no accurate translation in English. It means 'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'—something like that but intensified a thousandfold. \"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame of mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which they find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts of valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\" \"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his buttons?\" \"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass of despair. He may try anything to retrieve his lost happiness, rid his soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying hunger—By the way, where is he now?\" \"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\" \"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will find peace and forgetfulness.\" But Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the \"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment. Isobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he was acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive culprit. Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome Commander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was encased his precious set of bagpipes.

Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome Commander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was encased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their pegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection. \"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace o' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll see about that!\" And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the room, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge impervite gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway to Outside. On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle adjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But today they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture out. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have to get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of the entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman. Up to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding an aura of propriety. \"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the meeting.\" Wilkins looked at him bewilderedly. \"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\" Isobar's eyebrows arched. \"You mean you haven't been notified?\" \"Notified of what ?\" \"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I would take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\" \"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to call the office, maybe?\" And he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That—er—won't be necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run along. I'll watch this entrance for you.\" \"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a sharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back sudden-like.\" \"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\""}
{"chunk_id": "TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_5#0", "contents": "Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely out of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped through, and closed it behind him. A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated temperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but fragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with joyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at last! After six long and dreary months! Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes that ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the lunar valley.... How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not afterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He only knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a lacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the chirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes formed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one charmed. It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's entrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he was startled to hear—off to his right—the sharp, explosive bark of a Haemholtz ray pistol. He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his meandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed its hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the Gateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to judge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the structure which housed Sparks' radio turret. And the shooting? That could only be— He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that moment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of figures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was staggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm, bloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in his good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to cover his comrade's sluggish retreat. And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with astonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a dozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies! III Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A gasp of relief escaped the wounded man. \"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick, man—where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\" \"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is what ?\" \"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly make it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken, and—\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You don't have one! You're here alone ! Then you didn't pick up our call? But, why—?\" \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could move when urgency drove. His"}

Then you didn't pick up our call? But, why—?\" \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could move when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their peril. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action against their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons were useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary way of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you go! Give him a lift, Brown—There! That's the stuff!\" He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy sanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough when a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath his clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant inches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud. The Graniteback was not a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too weighty for that. Roberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\" \"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough. \"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long as it lasts, but—\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of Grannies unhappily—\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of superdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they come!\" For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic consultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged headlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like the shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted beneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about them in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged forest monarch shuddered in agony. Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it did not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly to one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken and cracked—revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!"}
{"chunk_id": "TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_6#0", "contents": "Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with terror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm. \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that—\" Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies meant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast. Even now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden idea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly. \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now. If we can just hold out—\" But Roberts shook his head. \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just been looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they first attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\" Isobar's last hope flickered out. \"Then I—I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have only got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to pick us up. But as it is—\" Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel. \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we volunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth a plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous stones-on-legs!\" Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are you doing out here, Isobar? And why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\" \"Oh—the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten his original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten his instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow throughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just happened to—Oh! the pipes! \" \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more, the three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy refuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts. This time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several snapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that the \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their adamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle. Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture of enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating Grannies. \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of fighting those filthy things—\" But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again, excitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing position, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over his shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath expelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive, fearsome, \" Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong! \" Roberts moaned. \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\" And Brown stared at him hopelessly. \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense of hearing.

See that grilled duct over there? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of order, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome—but the sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short while ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building! \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders. They'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe they'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can make him look out here—\" \" Stop talking! \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start blowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last hope. Blow! \" \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\" Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below. He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more, a solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing down upon the tree. \" Haa-a-roong! \" blew Isobar Jones. IV And—even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of his piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was incomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into whatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into action—the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt! As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless, questioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and vibrant droning! So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed, his lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow lifted his paralysis. \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They like it! Keep playing, Jonesy! Play, boy, like you never played before!\" And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the piobaireachd into which Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast! Then we were wrong. They can hear, after all! See that? They're lying down to listen—like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar! For once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\" Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack had stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly, quietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the tree. There was no doubt about it; the Grannies liked this music. Eyes raptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of gentle beatitude. One stirred once,"}

There was no doubt about it; the Grannies liked this music. Eyes raptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of gentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar paused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe with redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude. Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have been a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not—and in two cases dared not—allow him to stop playing. And to this audience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches, flings, dances—the stirring Rhoderik Dhu and the lilting Lassies O'Skye , the mournful Coghiegh nha Shie whose keening is like the sound of a sobbing nation. The Cock o' the North , he played, and Mironton ... Wee Flow'r o' Dee and MacArthur's March ... La Cucuracha and— And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood pounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the chaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the blow-pipe from his lips, gasped, \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few minutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his turret window five minutes ago!\" And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of those next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he knew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another sound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank, sent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio. He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of encouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below. \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and get out of here! Watch the Grannies—they'll be after us the minute Isobar stops playing!\" Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar voice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's fingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint: \"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres— those Grannies are stone dead !\""}

Illustrated by Freas Betty looked up from her magazine. She said mildly, \"You're late.\" \"Don't yell at me, I feel awful,\" Simon told her. He sat down at his desk, passed his tongue over his teeth in distaste, groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the aspirin bottle. He looked over at Betty and said, almost as though reciting, \"What I need is a vacation.\" \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going to use for money?\" \"Providence,\" Simon told her whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle, \"will provide.\" \"Hm-m-m. But before providing vacations it'd be nice if Providence turned up a missing jewel deal, say. Something where you could deduce that actually the ruby ring had gone down the drain and was caught in the elbow. Something that would net about fifty dollars.\" Simon said, mournful of tone, \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five hundred?\" \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All I want is enough to pay me this week's salary.\" \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you took this job you said it was the romance that appealed to you.\" \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most sleuthing amounted to snooping around department stores to check on the clerks knocking down.\" Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now it comes.\""}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_2#0", "contents": "There was a knock. Betty bounced up with Olympic agility and had the door swinging wide before the knocking was quite completed. He was old, little and had bug eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His suit was cut in the style of yesteryear but when a suit costs two or three hundred dollars you still retain caste whatever the styling. Simon said unenthusiastically, \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated the client's chair. \"Sit down, sir.\" The client fussed himself with Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed Simon, said finally, \"You know my name, that's pretty good. Never saw you before in my life. Stop fussing with me, young lady. Your ad in the phone book says you'll investigate anything.\" \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only one exception.\" \"Excellent. Do you believe in time travel?\" Simon said nothing. Across the room, where she had resumed her seat, Betty cleared her throat. When Simon continued to say nothing she ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\" \"Why?\" \"Why?\" \"Yes, why?\" Betty looked to her boss for assistance. None was forthcoming. There ought to be some very quick, positive, definite answer. She said, \"Well, for one thing, paradox. Suppose you had a time machine and traveled back a hundred years or so and killed your own great-grandfather. Then how could you ever be born?\" \"Confound it if I know,\" the little fellow growled. \"How?\" Simon said, \"Let's get to the point, what you wanted to see me about.\" \"I want to hire you to hunt me up some time travelers,\" the old boy said. Betty was too far in now to maintain her proper role of silent secretary. \"Time travelers,\" she said, not very intelligently. The potential client sat more erect, obviously with intent to hold the floor for a time. He removed the pince-nez glasses and pointed them at Betty. He said, \"Have you read much science fiction, Miss?\" \"Some,\" Betty admitted. \"Then you'll realize that there are a dozen explanations of the paradoxes of time travel. Every writer in the field worth his salt has explained them away. But to get on. It's my contention that within a century or so man will have solved the problems of immortality and eternal youth, and it's also my suspicion that he will eventually be able to travel in time. So convinced am I of these possibilities that I am willing to gamble a portion of my fortune to investigate the presence in our era of such time travelers.\" Simon seemed incapable of carrying the ball this morning, so Betty said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the future has developed time travel why don't we ever meet such travelers?\" Simon put in a word. \"The usual explanation, Betty, is that they can't afford to allow the space-time continuum track to be altered. If, say, a time traveler returned to a period of twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler, then all subsequent history would be changed. In that case, the time traveler himself might never be born.

Simon said, \"You want to hire me to find a time traveler and in some manner or other—any manner will do—exhort from him the secret of eternal life and youth, which you figure the future will have discovered. You're willing to pony up a part of this fortune of yours, if I can deliver a bona fide time traveler.\" \"Right!\" Betty had been looking from one to the other. Now she said, plaintively, \"But where are you going to find one of these characters—especially if they're interested in keeping hid?\" The old boy was the center again. \"I told you I'd been considering it for some time. The Oktoberfest , that's where they'd be!\" He seemed elated. Betty and Simon waited. \"The Oktoberfest ,\" he repeated. \"The greatest festival the world has ever seen, the carnival, feria , fiesta to beat them all. Every year it's held in Munich. Makes the New Orleans Mardi gras look like a quilting party.\" He began to swing into the spirit of his description. \"It originally started in celebration of the wedding of some local prince a century and a half ago and the Bavarians had such a bang-up time they've been holding it every year since. The Munich breweries do up a special beer, Marzenbräu they call it, and each brewery opens a tremendous tent on the fair grounds which will hold five thousand customers apiece. Millions of liters of beer are put away, hundreds of thousands of barbecued chickens, a small herd of oxen are roasted whole over spits, millions of pair of weisswurst , a very special sausage, millions upon millions of pretzels—\" \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept it. The Oktoberfest is one whale of a wingding.\""}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_4#0", "contents": "\"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into his subject now, \"that's where they'd be, places like the Oktoberfest . For one thing, a time traveler wouldn't be conspicuous. At a festival like this somebody with a strange accent, or who didn't know exactly how to wear his clothes correctly, or was off the ordinary in any of a dozen other ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could be a four-armed space traveler from Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous at the Oktoberfest . People would figure they had D.T.'s.\" \"But why would a time traveler want to go to a—\" Betty began. \"Why not! What better opportunity to study a people than when they are in their cups? If you could go back a few thousand years, the things you would wish to see would be a Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's orgies. You wouldn't want to wander up and down the streets of, say, Athens while nothing was going on, particularly when you might be revealed as a suspicious character not being able to speak the language, not knowing how to wear the clothes and not familiar with the city's layout.\" He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am, you'd have to stick to some great event, both for the sake of actual interest and for protection against being unmasked.\" The old boy wound it up. \"Well, that's the story. What are your rates? The Oktoberfest starts on Friday and continues for sixteen days. You can take the plane to Munich, spend a week there and—\" Simon was shaking his head. \"Not interested.\" As soon as Betty had got her jaw back into place, she glared unbelievingly at him. Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself. \"See here, young man, I realize this isn't an ordinary assignment, however, as I said, I am willing to risk a considerable portion of my fortune—\" \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be done.\" \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\" Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I like the fact that you already seem to have some interest and knowledge of the matter. I liked the way you knew my name when I walked in the door; my picture doesn't appear often in the papers.\" \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality in his voice. \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if you bring me a time traveler.\" \"Out of the question,\" Simon said. \"But why ?\" Betty wailed. \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell you a funny story. It goes like this:\" I got a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster (Simon began) in the way of an advance, and leaving him with Betty who was making out a receipt, I hustled back to the apartment and packed a bag.

It takes roughly three and a half hours to get to Gander from Idlewild. I spent the time planning the fun I was going to have. It takes roughly seven and a half hours from Gander to Shannon and I spent that time dreaming up material I could put into my reports to Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to give him some kind of report for his money. Time travel yet! What a laugh! Between Shannon and Munich a faint suspicion began to simmer in my mind. These statistics I read on the Oktoberfest in the Munich tourist pamphlets. Five million people attended annually. Where did five million people come from to attend an overgrown festival in comparatively remote Southern Germany? The tourist season is over before September 21st, first day of the gigantic beer bust. Nor could the Germans account for any such number. Munich itself has a population of less than a million, counting children. And those millions of gallons of beer, the hundreds of thousands of chickens, the herds of oxen. Who ponied up all the money for such expenditures? How could the average German, with his twenty-five dollars a week salary? In Munich there was no hotel space available. I went to the Bahnhof where they have a hotel service and applied. They put my name down, pocketed the husky bribe, showed me where I could check my bag, told me they'd do what they could, and to report back in a few hours. I had another suspicious twinge. If five million people attended this beer bout, how were they accommodated? The Theresienwiese , the fair ground, was only a few blocks away. I was stiff from the plane ride so I walked."}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_5#0", "contents": "There are seven major brewers in the Munich area, each of them represented by one of the circuslike tents that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent contained benches and tables for about five thousand persons and from six to ten thousands pack themselves in, competing for room. In the center is a tremendous bandstand, the musicians all lederhosen clad, the music as Bavarian as any to be found in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of peasant garbed fräuleins darted about the tables with quart sized earthenware mugs, platters of chicken, sausage, kraut and pretzels. I found a place finally at a table which had space for twenty-odd beer bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an assortment of Germans and foreign tourists as could have been dreamed up, ranging from a seventy- or eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian costume, to the bald-headed drunk across the table from me. A desperate waitress bearing six mugs of beer in each hand scurried past. They call them masses , by the way, not mugs. The bald-headed character and I both held up a finger and she slid two of the masses over to us and then hustled on. \"Down the hatch,\" the other said, holding up his mass in toast. \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before sipping, I said, \"You know, the tourist pamphlets say this stuff is eighteen per cent. That's nonsense. No beer is that strong.\" I took a long pull. He looked at me, waiting. I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted. A mass or two apiece later he looked carefully at the name engraved on his earthenware mug. \"Löwenbräu,\" he said. He took a small notebook from his pocket and a pencil, noted down the word and returned the things. \"That's a queer looking pencil you have there,\" I told him. \"German?\" \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry. Shouldn't have said that.\" I had never heard of the brand so I skipped it. \"Next is the Hofbräu,\" he said. \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation didn't seem to hang together very well. \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All my life I've been wanting to go back to an Oktoberfest and sample every one of the seven brands of the best beer the world has ever known. I'm only as far as Löwenbräu. I'm afraid I'll never make it.\" I finished my mass . \"I'll help you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor. Name is Simon.\" \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you help?\" \"I'm still fresh—comparatively. I'll navigate you around. There are seven beer tents. How many have you got through, so far?\" \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth said. I looked at him. \"It's going to be a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got a nice edge on.\" Outside, as we made our way to the next tent, the fair looked like every big State-Fair ever seen, except it was bigger. Games, souvenir stands, sausage stands, rides, side shows, and people, people, people. The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing as the last but we managed to find two seats.

The band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped with the mugs and drank each other's health. \"This is what I call a real beer bust,\" I said approvingly. Arth was waving to a waitress. As in the Löwenbräu tent, a full quart was the smallest amount obtainable. A beer later I said, \"I don't know if you'll make it or not, Arth.\" \"Make what?\" \"All seven tents.\" \"Oh.\" A waitress was on her way by, mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured to her for refills. \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I asked him, in the way of making conversation. \"2183.\" \"2183 where?\" He looked at me, closing one eye to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, 2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\" \"New Albuquerque? Where's that?\" Arth thought about it. Took another long pull at the beer. \"Right across the way from old Albuquerque,\" he said finally. \"Maybe we ought to be getting on to the Pschorrbräu tent.\" \"Maybe we ought to eat something first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel this. We could get some of that barbecued ox.\" Arth closed his eyes in pain. \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\" \"Well, we need some nourishment,\" I said. \"There's supposed to be considerable nourishment in beer.\" That made sense. I yelled, \" Fräulein! Zwei neu bier! \""}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_6#0", "contents": "Somewhere along in here the fog rolled in. When it rolled out again, I found myself closing one eye the better to read the lettering on my earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu. Somehow we'd evidently navigated from one tent to another. Arth was saying, \"Where's your hotel?\" That seemed like a good question. I thought about it for a while. Finally I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof. I don't think we'll ever make it, Arth. How many we got to go?\" \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can come home with me.\" We drank to that and the fog rolled in again. When the fog rolled out, it was daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight. I was sprawled, complete with clothes, on one of twin beds. On the other bed, also completely clothed, was Arth. That sun was too much. I stumbled up from the bed, staggered to the window and fumbled around for a blind or curtain. There was none. Behind me a voice said in horror, \"Who ... how ... oh, Wodo , where'd you come from?\" I got a quick impression, looking out the window, that the Germans were certainly the most modern, futuristic people in the world. But I couldn't stand the light. \"Where's the shade,\" I moaned. Arth did something and the window went opaque. \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned. \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd appreciate it.\" Arth was sitting on the edge of the bed holding his bald head in his hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed. \"You didn't have a hotel. What a stupidity. I'll be phased. Phased all the way down.\" \"You haven't got a handful of aspirin, have you?\" I asked him. \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering erect and heading for what undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay where you are. Don't move. Don't touch anything.\" \"All right,\" I told him plaintively. \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the place. All I've got is a hangover, not lice.\" Arth was gone. He came back in two or three minutes, box of pills in hand. \"Here, take one of these.\" I took the pill, followed it with a glass of water."}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_7#0", "contents": "And went out like a light. Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want another mass ?\" The band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring accompaniment. In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus! Eins, Zwei, G'sufa! At the G'sufa everybody upped with their king-size mugs and drank each other's health. My head was killing me. \"This is where I came in, or something,\" I groaned. Arth said, \"That was last night.\" He looked at me over the rim of his beer mug. Something, somewhere, was wrong. But I didn't care. I finished my mass and then remembered. \"I've got to get my bag. Oh, my head. Where did we spend last night?\" Arth said, and his voice sounded cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\" \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I feel lousy. I must have dimmed out. I've got to go to the Bahnhof and get my luggage.\" Arth didn't put up an argument on that. We said good-by and I could feel him watching after me as I pushed through the tables on the way out. At the Bahnhof they could do me no good. There were no hotel rooms available in Munich. The head was getting worse by the minute. The fact that they'd somehow managed to lose my bag didn't help. I worked on that project for at least a couple of hours. Not only wasn't the bag at the luggage checking station, but the attendant there evidently couldn't make heads nor tails of the check receipt. He didn't speak English and my high school German was inadequate, especially accompanied by a blockbusting hangover. I didn't get anywhere tearing my hair and complaining from one end of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew a blank on the bag. And the head was getting worse by the minute. I was bleeding to death through the eyes and instead of butterflies I had bats in my stomach. Believe me, nobody should drink a gallon or more of Marzenbräu."}
{"chunk_id": "UNBORN_TOMORROW_8#0", "contents": "I decided the hell with it. I took a cab to the airport, presented my return ticket, told them I wanted to leave on the first obtainable plane to New York. I'd spent two days at the Oktoberfest , and I'd had it. I got more guff there. Something was wrong with the ticket, wrong date or some such. But they fixed that up. I never was clear on what was fouled up, some clerk's error, evidently. The trip back was as uninteresting as the one over. As the hangover began to wear off—a little—I was almost sorry I hadn't been able to stay. If I'd only been able to get a room I would have stayed, I told myself. From Idlewild, I came directly to the office rather than going to my apartment. I figured I might as well check in with Betty. I opened the door and there I found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair he had been occupying four—or was it five—days before when I'd left. I'd lost track of the time. I said to him, \"Glad you're here, sir. I can report. Ah, what was it you came for? Impatient to hear if I'd had any results?\" My mind was spinning like a whirling dervish in a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of his money and had nothing I could think of to show for it; nothing but the last stages of a grand-daddy hangover. \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted. \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to make out my receipt. I thought you had already left.\" \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty said. There was suddenly a double dip of ice cream in my stomach. I walked over to my desk and looked down at the calendar. Mr. Oyster was saying something to the effect that if I didn't leave today, it would have to be tomorrow, that he hadn't ponied up that thousand dollars advance for anything less than immediate service. Stuffing his receipt in his wallet, he fussed his way out the door. I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose you haven't changed this calendar since I left.\" Betty said, \"What's the matter with you? You look funny. How did your clothes get so mussed? You tore the top sheet off that calendar yourself, not half an hour ago, just before this marble-missing client came in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time travelers yet.\" I tried just once more. \"Uh, when did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\" \"Never saw him before in my life,\" she said. \"Not until he came in this morning.\" \"This morning,\" I said weakly. While Betty stared at me as though it was me that needed candling by a head shrinker preparatory to being sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished in my pocket for my wallet, counted the contents and winced at the pathetic remains of the thousand. I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen, how long ago did I go out that door—on the way to the airport?\" \"You've been acting sick all morning. You went out that door about"}

You went out that door about ten minutes ago, were gone about three minutes, and then came back.\" \"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting Simon's story), \"did you say this was supposed to be amusing, young man? I don't find it so. In fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\" Simon shrugged, put one hand to his forehead and said, \"That's only the first chapter. There are two more.\" \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr. Oyster said. \"I suppose your point was to show me how ridiculous the whole idea actually is. Very well, you've done it. Confound it. However, I suppose your time, even when spent in this manner, has some value. Here is fifty dollars. And good day, sir!\" He slammed the door after him as he left. Simon winced at the noise, took the aspirin bottle from its drawer, took two, washed them down with water from the desk carafe. Betty looked at him admiringly. Came to her feet, crossed over and took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's one way of taking care of a crackpot. But I'm surprised you didn't take his money and enjoy that vacation you've been yearning about.\" \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three times.\" Betty stared at him. \"You mean—\" Simon nodded, miserably. She said, \"But Simon . Fifty thousand dollars bonus. If that story was true, you should have gone back again to Munich. If there was one time traveler, there might have been—\" \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said bitterly, \"I went back there three times. There were hundreds of them. Probably thousands.\" He took a deep breath. \"Listen, we're just going to have to forget about it. They're not going to stand for the space-time continuum track being altered. If something comes up that looks like it might result in the track being changed, they set you right back at the beginning and let things start—for you—all over again. They just can't allow anything to come back from the future and change the past.\" \"You mean,\" Betty was suddenly furious at him, \"you've given up! Why this is the biggest thing— Why the fifty thousand dollars is nothing. The future! Just think!\" Simon said wearily, \"There's just one thing you can bring back with you from the future, a hangover compounded of a gallon or so of Marzenbräu. What's more you can pile one on top of the other, and another on top of that!\" He shuddered. \"If you think I'm going to take another crack at this merry-go-round and pile a fourth hangover on the three I'm already nursing, all at"}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys! I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble. Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into. Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin. \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\" I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government to run ships. I felt free all over—and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt !"}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_2#0", "contents": "It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white doors—on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big ship ! Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing. So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were portholes on the hull. I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency. I looked for the important things. As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now, I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do. Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the Middle Ages. \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the following fashion.\" I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea! And all the time I was alone. That was the best part."}

{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_3#0", "contents": "Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red. I peeked around the corner. I knew it—the next deck was the hull. I could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed existed in the Universe. There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely. If I just took one quick look.... But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently. Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted—\" Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to men. \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this clause—'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family, this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations pertaining'—and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs. No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\" Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands. Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law. I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off, Marsbound. I wished I was on that one! Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the wall in glowing red letters"}

Passengers: Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\" Another one of those signs."}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_4#0", "contents": "I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open it with. Not even a button you could press. That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice key—might as well see if that's it, I figured. \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\" For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million possible combinations—The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine. I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that looked hard and soft at the same time. His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his back. And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation—the kind of tan that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down to his shoulders. I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books; every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all, when I suddenly got scared right through. His eyes. They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them. Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it opened two long tooth-studded jaws. \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting jumpy enough to splash.\" Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly leather, crossed his arms on his"}

I grunted to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes. I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.—Mr.—\" \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you seem—tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\" \" What? \" \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come from Flatfolk ways.\" \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian? What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope—\" He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a boss-minded sister.\" \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\" \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\" \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms."}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_5#0", "contents": "He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets. He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution."}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_6#0", "contents": "He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat. \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth, she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\" \"How's that?\" \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal husband, he's not much to boast about.\" The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a bellyful!\" He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in school used to say. The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !—he not only resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he sassed the judge in open court! \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\" \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination, they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men. My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\""}

And I'm with you while you're doing it?\" He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously. \"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what business do you have this close to the hull?\" After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\" He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis insists such things have always had for men. \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\" I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\" \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the eighties—the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\" \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\" He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys—all except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down. Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\" I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with that, Mr. Butt?\" \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at the light globe. \"No more'n twelve—not counting five government paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it, violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas, now—\""}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_8#0", "contents": "He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat and Butt was used to a farmer's diet. Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell. Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things about Venus every time I visited that stowaway.... I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging, Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no matter what, he would never let me hold it. \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.\" \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador. All I have is Sis. And she —\" \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\" And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out.

Most of the other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser really work in those orientation periods. \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm, \"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that—Wait, I remember something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing in recent years. In fact—\" \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent? You remember, purser—Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\" The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\" But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one. She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out with her. \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\" The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's library,\" I told her in a hurry. \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed—this Terran Agent—\" \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered. Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\" \"They're not!\" \"Not what?\" \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away! \"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like Venus.\" \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\" \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start civilization on a new planet.

You've got to have men who aren't afraid to make their own law if necessary—with their own guns. That's where law begins; the books get written up later.\" \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\" \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\" \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand—after I have found a good, steady husband, of course—and I don't look forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been filling your head with all this nonsense?\""}
{"chunk_id": "Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_10#0", "contents": "I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor. \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\" A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\" \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course, in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\" \"Nobody! Nobody! \" \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand—\" \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me Ford.\" \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\" After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided miserably. Besides, she was a girl. All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better. The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures. He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back. \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\" So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed sternly. \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\""}

Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word. \"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up Venus.\" \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before—\" \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\" \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\""}

Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat—don't you know that every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs? Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\" \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you. I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him equally guilty?\" \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted—\" \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\" \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\" He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female; I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\" Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are—are you daring to suggest that—that—\" \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific stock, too.\" I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\""}

Yet they had to exist, had to build a new life on a hostile world. And the man who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the bespectacled secretary—whose only adventures had come through the pages of a book. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Sparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the radio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead named Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on Greg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't think I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\" Greg said, \"Why not?\" Sparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering. \"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And then there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they ain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out worse storms than this—plenty of times. And in worse crates than the Carefree .\" Greg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles. He drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's that bad, eh, Sparks?\" \"What bad? I just told you—\" \"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied astrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And I think I know what we're up against. \"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for more than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands of miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a super-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed. You can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being whirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\" \"I don't know what—\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his companion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But we ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ... Graves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they ain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\" \"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to. But between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\" The radioman shrugged. \"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss us out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old chuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack us up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\" \"And the controls?\" \"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\" \"So?\" \"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\" Malcolm nodded quietly.

I'm going up to the dining dome.\" Sparks stared at him querulously. \"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your body.\" \"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything happens—and if there's time to do so—let me know.\" He paused at the door. \"Good luck,\" he said. \"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man wonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks, shaking his head and muttering."}
{"chunk_id": "Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_2#0", "contents": "Gregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly through the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the space yacht Carefree . He paused once to peer through a perilens set into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his gaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming splotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading their ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's tiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet that the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of space-atmospherics through which the Carefree was now being twisted, topsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal. He moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation rotunda which was the dining dome of the ship. His footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As he hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass mirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they were as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly. J. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand or more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation, dominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little Napoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and elaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the nearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid. On Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a mud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because of her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with suppressed humor at—guessed Greg—the amusing foibles and frailties of those about her. She gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and shapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics, pausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a watery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet poodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\" On J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused Gregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as he glimpsed her reflected vision—all gold and crimson and cream—in the glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her loveliness. But—Greg shook his head—but she was not for him. She was already pledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned to murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and disliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich brownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes. The sound of his own name startled Greg. \"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where in blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone in general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve jar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained. \"It's the very best Martian honey,\" said his wife. \"Drylands clover,\""}

Foster petulantly. His sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\" \"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice again. \" Malcolm! Where are you?\" \"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded politely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss Andrews ... Mr. Breadon....\" \"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your head like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's bitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been, anyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio turret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\" Malcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\" \"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words registered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that? Don't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to—\" \"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly. \"No trans—nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million credits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment throughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right up there and—\""}

He's standing there with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in edgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan Foster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \" That? \" She glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence wove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora. Greg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\" Enid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table. \"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\" \"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously. \"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It—it—shouldn't stay with us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\" Breadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply. \"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\" Greg said, \"Yes.\" \"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near—\" Breadon stopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass it off easily. \"Oh, well—a change of scenery, what?\" But the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal Andrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet. \"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there—danger?\" But Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh, defiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews, Crystal's older brother. \"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with you folks—are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a space-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't even see—and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be smashed as flat as pancakes!\" The proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank; his vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews—\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's sudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing roar at his only son. \"Bert—you're drunk!\" Bert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face. \"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The whole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You too, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do—hide the bad news from them? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're gone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell into a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the too-high notes of his laughter. J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was only deep concern in his voice. \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\" Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger—but there is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr. Breadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the Heaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\" Maud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly. \"Is there anything we can do?\" \"Not a thing."}

The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\" \"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our breakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg looked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said, \"The life-skiffs?\" \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it were necessary. We'll hope it's not—\" But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For even as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing footsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes hot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for safety. \"Everybody—the Number Four life-skiff— quick ! We've been caught in a grav-drag and we're going to crash!\" II Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg Malcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks' warning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified as emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling, suddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship out of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to allay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly, with Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome down the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams in the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff cradled there. He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around him, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested spectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward the door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the weight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\" Then the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as they charged on down the corridor. J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The officers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of themselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over the hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and bodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited body hot beneath them ...

Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from a nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize. A tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A world peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and daughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul, the cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not know). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space. Somewhere in space. He looked through the perilens . What he saw then he might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil had wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a distant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht Carefree . Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward a mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal terrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last dreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that tried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall. For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they glimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the Carefree ; a mote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be sure, and then the Carefree was accelerating with such violence and speed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against the ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of flame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all.... And Greg Malcolm turned from the perilens , shaken. Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded. Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they caught?\" \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\" \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\" \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\" Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other huddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over now, Malcolm.\""}

{"chunk_id": "Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_4#0", "contents": "It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly at first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the small ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization and civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until this moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening while ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies of ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it was for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for this brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater than knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had studied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he might be fitted to command when all others failed. And now— And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm, mild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the man at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman, trained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong.... \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls. What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened to Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty. However that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency, once-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the life-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff jerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing motors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that lost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting easily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously. The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood the operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And that neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand leaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's—and across both their bodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls. In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The motors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg cried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed; one of the women bleated fearfully. Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his own. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly, in the illumined perilens , how near to swift death that moment of uncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been high in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite or whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at lightning speed."}

{"chunk_id": "Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_5#0", "contents": "Only a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his head, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just a hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the maid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her nether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out. Only a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed that miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ... a lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face twisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut and bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to bounce—\" Then they struck! But they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for, and gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered and groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again, settled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward something snapped with a shrill, high ping! of stress; somewhere aft was the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But they were safe. Breath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped Greg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh, nice work!\" But surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him. \"It would have been better work, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned hands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff! Our only—\" \"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it yourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\" \"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled the youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you, Malcolm—after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume responsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out and see how bad the damage is.\" Instinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced the cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's overwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to Bedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to normal. He said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the broken skiff."}
{"chunk_id": "Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_6#0", "contents": "Hannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\" \"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like a fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should be an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that—\" \"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan. \"What? Oh, you mean—?\" \"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\" \"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could have happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering everything. Anyhow—\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced, efficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely precarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's nervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering—\" \"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure I know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean anything .\" He glanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there on the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to the boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie hero—for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the spur without a squawk—\" Malcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost stubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\" \"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\" Sparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they were separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to make a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more or less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward removing certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and uncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument. The gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was that everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as to just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting desire to participate in actual physical labor. J. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled, was planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port of the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul who—as Greg watched—stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of edibles. 'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the complaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had suffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews (who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and Miss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener immediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was so hungry)! Bert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the warmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink, while the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was shouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his divided and completely frantic attention.

His orders were masterpieces of confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew should immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent equipment, Breadon did not venture to say. \"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly."}
{"chunk_id": "Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_7#0", "contents": "Greg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot, while excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an ideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by shallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on their greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them. These caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might well become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men. He saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern hills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things— He nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was but one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The apparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued his judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an atmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with disaster. \"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\" Sparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of dismay. \"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\" \"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as large as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm. Titan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian tractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\" Sparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes to Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no—\" He stopped suddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey—this place is dangerous ! There are—\" \"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use telling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't know won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves organized into a defensive community. That's the only way—\" Ralph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well, Malcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\" And J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the order. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my man. We want action!\" Sparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and looked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved forward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. Hannigan groaned and followed him. III Breadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to say.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want to get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you, Sparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space cruiser.\" Hannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time answering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his head. He said, \"A message, huh?\" \"That's what I said.\" \"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\" Breadon flushed darkly. \"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically you are a radio operator?\" \"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated"}

Best equipment throughout.\" Sparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're both right. I am a radio operator, and there was a radio. But we crashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the master switch—\" \"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged little redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\" \"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass don't bounce so good.\" Greg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\" \"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't know till I get going on it.\" Breadon frowned. \"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well, you get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed, send out an SOS advising the patrol where we are—\" \"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\" Breadon glared at him wrathfully. \"Why—why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can see that!\" \"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan? And when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account of it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol? SOS. Stranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan, maybe. They'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our knees.\" Breadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I—I don't know. We have a compass—\" Once again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He had been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the skiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his right forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He said, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search in half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\" Maud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first time in her life. \"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\""}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Of course coming events cast their shadows before, but this shadow was 400 years long! The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several magazines: MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS! What is the secret source of those profound principles that can solve the problems of life? Send for our FREE booklet of explanation. Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU can alter the course of your life! Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages! The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth POSAT an ancient secret society Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all, similar to the many that had appeared through the years under the name of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the familiar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and mildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip the attached coupon and send for the booklet—sometime—when a pen or pencil was nearer at hand. Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of Your Life and Psychology that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus. He filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil. \"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly liked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe it. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he had, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time. Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement was unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine. The radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always liked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading would be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what the cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said. It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the Antivivisectionist Gazette the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT ad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having filled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that would take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post it as soon as possible. Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at the bottom of a column in The Bulletin of Physical Research . He was engrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired from the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research worker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT ad with the disregard accorded to any common object."}

Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at the bottom of a column in The Bulletin of Physical Research . He was engrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired from the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research worker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT ad with the disregard accorded to any common object. He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that some component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that couldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page. It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr atom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the printed matter that accompanied it. \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter was conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted it in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted lines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it. He addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and promptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was entrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his other letters. Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in response to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information than had the original advertisement, but with considerable more volubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself—if he would merely fill out the enclosed form. Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had mentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he had watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were almost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by something supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope. He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay heavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested information—about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his reason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without quite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some of his desperation and sense of futility. Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the information that she wished to give—all about her poor, dear father who had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt toward the mystic cults of the East,"}

Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the information that she wished to give—all about her poor, dear father who had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt toward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were reincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a religion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete and absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their booklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately. Fortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial situation. To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that POSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in his employment or financial position? It also served to increase his curiosity. \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty, handing her the booklet and questionnaire. \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as she usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's that you won't stop until you find out!\" \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin. \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she suggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our money. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\" Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with correct answers!\" \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your imagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give for your reasons for asking about POSAT?\" \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest pocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script. It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the contents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of POSAT the following week. For this time they differed. Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed gave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They were couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no help to him. His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he had unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap. When he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a position had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older industrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place to work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was hope for the future.

It was not a particularly attractive place to work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was hope for the future. It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the other side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind alley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence in them. Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not only several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that one of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it contained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and black enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an active member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month; please remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled contentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats. After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy it, too. Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown contents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded sheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with sharp surprise. \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on the dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\" She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by one. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of some sort.\" \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried Don. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered a new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common household ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a daily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent exterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use as a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too dangerous to be passed on?'\" \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to find out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're so careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\" Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like an attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about my work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know what company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures attitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\" \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be—a secret society—and that they actually screen their applicants?\" He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the"}

His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and, paradoxically, was more personal than its forerunners. Dear Doctor Alford: We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to us. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the requirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable secret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT. Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand Chairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this arrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make another appointment for you. The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one for Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the laboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his research problems home with him and worried over them half the night, they were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for pursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was in a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a whole day off for chasing will-o-wisps? It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be disappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her about it without telephoning. Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home! But it was impossible! He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the envelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him, unmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number of the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given them! \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some perfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the directory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of the university. Or—or—\" But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed.

They looked it up in the directory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of the university. Or—or—\" But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His laboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble of looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that particular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own, POSAT had unearthed the information. His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring? Subversive agents?\" Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His conservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too melodramatic. At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he knew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT. He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not be at work on Tuesday."}
{"chunk_id": "What_is_POSAT?_2#0", "contents": "At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters. It seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall was occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete construction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the street in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings of a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and was also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms. It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door marked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT. He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced a dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him a buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way up through the murky stairwell. The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk facing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the pattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of the summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom somewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here that he had come to expect. The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary. Not the Mata-Hari type , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own suspicions. He handed her the letter. She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step into the next room—\" She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it. The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the shock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and the shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing. The rug—Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum. The paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were surely old masters—of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he recognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the artists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian. Or was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities of his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of Operational Circuit Analysis. The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with the wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another door. Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye level—that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend over a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently there was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those days? He wished he knew more about such things.

Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube held on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his scrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the light. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a muffled thud. Now I've done it! thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube hadn't shattered. In fact—it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact, even while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the brackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support the tube. There were no wires! Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between trembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two or three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it minutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries. The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never seen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held one in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as experimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the radioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded. Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still be searching for the right combination of fluorescent material and radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient, self-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this moment! But this is impossible! he thought. We're the only company that's working on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual production! And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it have fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society, The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth? The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper and more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have asked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the F.B.I. Even now— With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and stepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it impatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His impatience changed to panic. It was locked! A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had entered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light bracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still as bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer seemed ordinary.

Her gaze was still as bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer seemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was distressingly ominous. \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice. Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal expecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage to find. She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he supposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT. Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room, which must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted outside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where a frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman. But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of the room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of which he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar to him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had ever used, and there was something about it that convinced him that this was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments did not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony. \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There could be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely through the bluish-green plastic shielding it. His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had spoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened. He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated wildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense that only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain semitransparent? His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as the alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't—couldn't—be allowed to leave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place alive to tell the fantastic story to the world! \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you again.\" \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \" You're the Grand Chairman of POSAT?\" He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which Crandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and his own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure of scientific facts.

{"chunk_id": "What_is_POSAT?_3#0", "contents": "Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm his identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him. Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right about us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization has broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself before the day is over.\" Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility. \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\" Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long story to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to trust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of what POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the most moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have stumbled into a den of thieves.\" Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue. \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\" Don nodded, too bewildered to speak. \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part of his personal collection—which, incidentally, he bought from the artists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for power here in the laboratory.\" \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was hanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian—\" \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I really don't know too much about them.\" \"But how could a man alive today buy paintings from an artist of the Renaissance?\" \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements claim—an ancient secret society. Our founder has been dead for over four centuries.\" \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\" \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years, however.\" Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's start at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the classroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the pages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years ago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a super-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not in every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of years. \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was one like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia, and his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course of man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand years has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the civilizations to which it has been passed on directly. \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was a physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager heritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling physical puzzles one by one."}

Starting with the meager heritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling physical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his principal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what we call Maxwell's equations—although, of course, he antedated Maxwell by centuries—developed the special and general theories of relativity, the tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he mathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding energy of nuclei—\" \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It hasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed cried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet—there sat the reactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction of Don's glance. \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed his theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw the destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could not have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his knowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about him. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states, intrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his time atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker with a lighted fuse. \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He didn't think so. No one else in his age could have derived the knowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo. Michelangelo. There were men capable of learning his science, even as men can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded this society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries and at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He urged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them safely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as possible.\" Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that it is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have walked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four hundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a little early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\" \"But by one man,\" Don argued.

So are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had come, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know that inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based on the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of simultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only our own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous. \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply."}
{"chunk_id": "What_is_POSAT?_4#0", "contents": "Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm of possibility. But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread before him. \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred years head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have uncovered in that time!\" \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon. \"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've undoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a fairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are other things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until you have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them. \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as they contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization so that it can use physical science without disaster.\" For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his heart sank. \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of advance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to prevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are, still snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats—and we've caught up with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that time? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\" \"Come with me,\" said Crandon. He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a steep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw what must have been the world's largest computing machine. \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which we find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the newest of the sciences—that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready to put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one respect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to save our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to do. Will you join us, Don?\" \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a weird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just anyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work for me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why haven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work on this project—before it's too late?\" Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that! But you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is to maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely disclosed.

Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if they attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it! \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were invited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we know more about how you will react in any given situation than you do yourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be safe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might be perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though, at how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we want. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well, and we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want, a powerful motivator.\" \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of applicants who would be of no use to you at all.\" \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We enroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in line with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep, if they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if they come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we can act when the time finally comes. \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last resort—lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we put into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate them—anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's good practice for us. \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't answered mine. Will you join us?\" Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him. He had one more question. \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the stubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\" Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\" Don nodded, his tense features relaxing. \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said."}

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Meeting someone who's been dead for twenty years is shocking enough for anyone with a belief in ghosts—worse for one with none! I The narrow cove was quiet as the face of an expectant child, yet so near the ruffled Atlantic that the last push of wind carried the Annie O. its full length. The man in gray flannels and sweatshirt let the sail come crumpling down and hurried past its white folds at a gait made comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky ledge came nearer. Slowly the blue V inscribed on the cove's surface by the sloop's prow died. Sloop and ledge kissed so gently that he hardly had to reach out his hand. He scrambled ashore, dipping a sneaker in the icy water, and threw the line around a boulder. Unkinking himself, he looked back through the cove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands and the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed in satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing every man yearns to do once in his lifetime—gone to the farthest island out. He must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he dropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the Annie O. had always been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock had faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the quietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically, paused here to rest. As if all changes were erased on this one bit of Earth. The man's lean, melancholy face crinkled into a grin at the banal fancy. He turned his back on his new friend, the little green sloop, without one thought for his nets and specimen bottles, and set out to explore. The ground rose steeply at first and the oaks were close, but after a little way things went downhill and the leaves thinned and he came out on more rocks—and realized that he hadn't quite gone to the farthest one out."}
{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_2#0", "contents": "Joined to this island by a rocky spine, which at the present low tide would have been dry but for the spray, was another green, high island that the first had masked from him all the while he had been sailing. He felt a thrill of discovery, just as he'd wondered back in the woods whether his might not be the first human feet to kick through the underbrush. After all, there were thousands of these islands. Then he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving smoothly enough. To the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still. It even began with another deep cove, in which he glimpsed the spiny spheres of sea urchins. But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his trousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought of what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up from here in a storm. He crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced through a fringe of trees—and came straight up against an eight-foot fence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short distance with high, heavy shrubbery. Without pausing for surprise—in fact, in his holiday mood, using surprise as a goad—he jumped for the branch of an oak whose trunk touched the fence, scorning the easier lower branch on the other side of the tree. Then he drew himself up, worked his way to some higher branches that crossed the fence, and dropped down inside. Suddenly cautious, he gently parted the shrubbery and, before the first surprise could really sink in, had another. A closely mown lawn dotted with more shrubbery ran up to a snug white Cape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretched the length of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just in front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he recognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole scene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove. Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door opened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged dress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the Essex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug bravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees. The door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a white silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height waistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound with a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark necklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked under her arm. She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table between three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across the lawn."}

She whirled around and stared at him as still as if her heart had stopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited for him there. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm seemed not so much excessive as eerie. As if, the man thought, he were not an ordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet. Approaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath was coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician face that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy that reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than eighteen. He stopped short of the table. Before he could speak, she stammered out, \"Are you he?\" \"What do you mean?\" he asked, smiling puzzledly. \"The one who sends me the little boxes.\" \"I was out sailing and I happened to land in the far cove. I didn't dream that anyone lived on this island, or even came here.\" \"No one ever does come here,\" she replied. Her manner had changed, becoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily curious. \"It startled me tremendously to find this place,\" he blundered on. \"Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a quarter of a mile wide.\" \"The road goes down to the wharf,\" she explained, \"and up to the top of the island, where my aunts have a tree-house.\" He tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen Mary clambering up a tree. \"Was that your aunt I saw driving off?\" \"One of them. The other's taken the motorboat in for supplies.\" She looked at him doubtfully. \"I'm not sure they'll like it if they find someone here.\" \"There are just the three of you?\" he cut in quickly, looking down the empty road that vanished among the oaks. She nodded. \"I suppose you go in to the mainland with your aunts quite often?\" She shook her head. \"It must get pretty dull for you.\" \"Not very,\" she said, smiling. \"My aunts bring me the papers and other things. Even movies. We've got a projector. My favorite stars are Antonio Morino and Alice Terry. I like her better even than Clara Bow.\" He looked at her hard for a moment. \"I suppose you read a lot?\" She nodded. \"Fitzgerald's my favorite author.\" She started around the table, hesitated, suddenly grew shy. \"Would you like some lemonade?\""}

He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. \"I'm a biology student. Been working at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here to do research in marine ecology—that's sort of sea-life patterns—of the in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich.

You ought to have heard of him.\" He grinned. \"Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for Mrs. Kesserich.\" The girl looked puzzled. Jack explained, \"The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences, won't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow. When I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich—she's a drab sort of person—said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of course, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\" \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as if she were saying it for the first time. \"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\" \"How would I know?\" The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this strangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\" \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely. The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to talk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\" \"Why?\" \"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\" \"But I never go to the mainland.\" \"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his mind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves. \"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are very capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help them.\" \"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You can't be shut off this way from people your own age!\" \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or a man before, except in movies.\" \"You're joking!\" \"No, it's true.\" \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why are they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\""}

May I tell you a secret?\" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest trembling. \"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me—you're right about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a little box.\" \"What's that?\" he said sharply. \"Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures, or flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the poems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends, 'Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude—'\" \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\" \"I don't know.\" \"But how are the notes signed?\" \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd imagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\" \"Yes, but how are they signed?\" She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\" \"And so when you first saw me, you thought—\" He began, then stopped because she was blushing. \"How long have you been getting them?\" \"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new ones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\" \"But how does this—person get these boxes to you out here? Does he give them to your aunts and do they put them there?\" \"I'm not sure.\" \"But how can they get them in winter?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Look here,\" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, \"how long is it since you've been to the mainland?\" \"Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle of the war.\" \"What war?\" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade. \"The World War, of course. What's the matter?\" Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind of terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him had changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders, the same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his nostrils. He could still hear the faint chop-chop of the waves. And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape glimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to a sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the newspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read: HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones: Foes of Machado Riot in Havana Big NRA Parade Planned Balbo Speaks in New York"}

{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_6#0", "contents": "Suddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was yellow and brittle-edged. \"Why are you so interested in old newspapers?\" he asked. \"I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,\" the girl objected, pointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933. \"You're trying to joke,\" Jack told her. \"No, I'm not.\" \"But it's 1953.\" \"Now it's you who are joking.\" \"But the paper's yellow.\" \"The paper's always yellow.\" He laughed uneasily. \"Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps you're to be envied,\" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite feel. \"Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or television, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb, or—\" \"Stop!\" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced. \"I don't like what you're saying.\" \"But—\" \"No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound different here.\" \"I'm really not joking,\" he said after a moment. She grew quite frantic at that. \"I can show you all last week's papers! I can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!\" She started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to pound. At the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack thought he could hear the faint chug of a motorboat. She pushed open the door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark after the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a fireplace with brass andirons. \"Flash!\" croaked a gritty voice. \"After their disastrous break day before yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....\" Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm around the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice was coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio loudspeaker. The girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her gray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere. \"I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that you're here.\" \"All right they won't like it.\" Her agitation grew. \"No, you must go.\" \"I'll come back tomorrow,\" he heard himself saying. \"Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn, mouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle Shylock.\" Jack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the girl growing stranger still. \"You must go before they see you.\" \"Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe, after a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes. Asked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....\""}

{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_7#0", "contents": "He was halfway across the lawn before he realized the terror into which the grating radio voice had thrown him. He leaped for the branch over-hanging the fence, vaulted up with the risky help of a foot on the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking time to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of him. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked together just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to either side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a squeak. Jack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray from the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he stumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought his way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line of the Annie O. , dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could, plunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled aboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks. As soon as the Annie O. was nosing out of the cove into the cross waves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent the sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail, and plunging ahead. For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind and the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his attention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't have to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion, and wonder about flappers and hidden traps. When he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how tiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland. Then he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly overtook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in the bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair that whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that it was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches over the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to the roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle. But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves drenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for a minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail. Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross his bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail, watching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him. Then he turned and gratefully followed the dark, wide, fanlike sterns and age-yellowed sails."}

{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_8#0", "contents": "II The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home—a weathered white cube with narrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola—was nothing like its lavish interior. In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming furniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless black form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack think of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered again how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature. Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the uneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were still those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been watching the house a long, long while from the barnyard. He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named Mary Alice Pope?\" The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some bovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall cabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel, opened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and handed him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked in his breath with surprise. It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same flat-bosomed dress—flowered rather than white—no bandeau, same beads. Same proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier. \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat voice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident in 1933.\" The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to reality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the gloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with what seemed a malicious eagerness. \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\" Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question—he was much too dazed for that—he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her position on the edge of the sofa. \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love of Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as you probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he first came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda, there was a cloak of loneliness about him—or rather about the three of them. \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud—I don't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a servant—and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They showered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't realize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with Mary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without marrying, he was safe. \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say,"}

They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without marrying, he was safe. \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred British stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point very wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did everything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was afraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani and Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her fear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But—and here is where Mary's wisdom fell short—her brave gesture did not pacify them: it only increased their hatred. \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love. It was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as narrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\""}
{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_9#0", "contents": "With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him all this. She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a home for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful future for them as well—not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by year, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos Aires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would teach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where he would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so on. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been away. His research was keeping him very busy—\" Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive work on growth and fertilization?\" Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering darkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early evening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to the station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary rode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering to the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the saddle to welcome him home. \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station wagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I drove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\" She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold line of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were waiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the station. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the gravel of the crossing. \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and Hilda followed—to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage that, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as her horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare. \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In fact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary—I mean, what had been Mary—and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\" A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened and was silent. Jack turned. The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall—a seemingly young, sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was a click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray hair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive mouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the youth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy. \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife."}

{"chunk_id": "Yesterday_House_10#0", "contents": "III \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called individualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much about the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\" Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far. \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled. The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival, Mrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew why and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their conversation to the professor. Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more important papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if it were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had suddenly posed this question about individuality. \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that make you you, and me me.\" \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman. Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose—this is just speculation—that we could control heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same individual at will.\" Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\" \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's parthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the mother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had grown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling secretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say nothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce with no more stimulus than a salt solution.\" Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\" \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some special technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits?\" \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate would be bound to develop differently.\" \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical twins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met by accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman. Each had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox terrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments similar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of them had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\" For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering, becoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's sphinx-like face. \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\" the biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the one who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels. \"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I won't have any time for it tomorrow.\" Jack looked at him blankly. \"Tomorrow I must attend"}

Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked the sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering about Kesserich and his wife—things said and half said last night—but found instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as if to a farthest island in a world of people. Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet—he felt behind it, but the key was gone—he hurried down to the waterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an afterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers. The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the Annie O. There was eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the mast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous with faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir. After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky spine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures struck an uncomfortable chord in his memory. This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the innocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd brought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence when he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it. He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the same time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him. The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to speak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never come back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've been watching for you all morning.\" He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read them now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the headlines.\" When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She tried unsuccessfully to speak. \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make you believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's 1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I think I know who you really are.\" \"But,\" the girl faltered, \"my aunts tell me it's 1933.\" \"They would.\" \"And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.\" \"The papers are old ones. The radio's faked—some sort of recording. I could show you if I could get at it.\" \" These papers might be faked,\" she said, pointing to where she'd let them drop on the ground. \"They're new,\" he said. \"Only old papers get yellow.\" \"But why would they do it to me? Why? \" \"Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight"}

When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. \"A life that's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with me, Mary.\""}
