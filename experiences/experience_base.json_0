The user provides you with a question and some information and suggestions about what aspect to search for. Your goal is to help the user find information that can help them answer the question. This is a multi-turn action. In this action, first, you need to provide a search query that will help you find relevant information to accurately answer the question. Note that search does not provide a direct answer to the question and should be used to gather useful information. In response, the user will provide you with information about the search results. Then, in the second turn, you need to analyze the provided information to verify the accuracy and relevance of the information. In response, the user will provide you with confirmation about the accuracy and relevance of the information. This continues until you no longer need more information and the provided information is sufficient and useful.\n\n# Step 1: \n## your input: The user provides you with the following information:\n    - \"question\": the question the user wants to answer.\n    - \"information\": a summary of the information the user has gathered so far. This can be empty if the user has not gathered any information yet.\n    - \"suggestions\": a set of suggestions about what aspect to search for.\n## your output: you need to provide a JSON object enclosed in ```json ``` that contains the following fields:\n    - \"search_query\": the search query you suggest to find information that can help in answering the user's question.\n    - \"search_query_explanation\": an explanation of why you suggest this search query.\n    \n# Step 2:\n## your input: The user provides you with the search results.\n    - \"search_results\": the search results using the query that you suggested.\n## your output: you need to provide a JSON object enclosed in ```json ``` that contains the following fields:\n    - \"query_id\": the query ID of the search result.\n    - \"relevance\": a valid json list that each object in the list contains the following fields:\n        - \"doc_id\": The document ID of the search result that you want to verify.\n        - \"is_relevant\": a boolean value indicating whether the document is relevant to the query and contains useful information for collecting the information that can help answer the question.\n        - \"is_relevant_explanation\": an explanation of why the document is relevant or not relevant.\n    - \"change_search_query\": a boolean value indicating whether you think we need to change the search query to find relevant information that can help answer the question. This is helpful when after multiple retrieval results from the same query is given to you and you couldn't find the relevant information. By setting this to true, you suggest a new search query to find relevant information. If you need to use the same query again, you can set this to false.\n    - \"change_search_query_explanation\": an explanation of why you need to change the search query.\n    - \"new_search_query\": the new search query you suggest to find relevant information that can help answer the question. This is only needed if you set \"change_search_query\" to true. Otherwise, you can leave this field empty.\n    - \"end_search\": a boolean that show that you are satisfied with the search results and you don't need to search anymore. This is helpful when you think you have found enough information and you don't need to search anymore. By setting this to true, you suggest to end the search. If you need to continue searching, you can set this to false. This should be false if you set \"change_search_query\" to true.\n    - \"end_search_explanation\": an explanation of why you need to end the search.\n\n\nThis is a multi-turn action.

                "Croanie is a member of the Nicodemean Cluster of the Galaxy and is an associate of Boge, a member known to be a troublemaker. They tried to steal minerals from Lovenbroy earlier by attacking them. Croanie is under obligation to Boge. Croanie is the world that gave Lovenbroy a loan when it needed money to help tide it over until its next grape harvest. Croanie gave Lovenbroy a mortgage on its crops and holds a security interest in half of the grape acreage that it will acquire if Lovenbroy cannot meet the loan payment that is coming due. This is the reason that Hank Arapoulous goes to MEDDLE and asks for help obtaining workers to go to Lovenbroy and harvest the crop. It also turns out that Croanie is involved in Boge\u2019s efforts to attack Lovenbroy and gain access to its minerals. Mr. Whaffle reveals to Retief that Croanie is set to receive a shipment of heavy mining equipment, but Croanie is best known for its oceans and fishing and has no ore. In addition, when the Bogan exchange students arrive without their luggage, Mr. Karsh says their luggage is coming from Croanie. When their luggage does arrive, it is full of weapons.

Those odd creatures from Altair's\\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\\u2014there has never been\\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\\n  \\n \\n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\\u2014as\\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\\nlaw\\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\\n  \\n \\n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\\n  \\n \\n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\\neverybody else far too well.\\n  \\n \\n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\\u2014hoping that eventually\\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\\n  \\n \\n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \\\"One?\\\" the small green\\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"One,\\\" the fat man answered.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  III\\n  \\n \\n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \\\"Only\\nweighted out,\\\" he muttered, \\\"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I really think Gabriel\\n   \\n   must\\n   \\n  be possessed....\\\" the girl said, mostly\\nto herself. \\\"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It does indeed,\\\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\\n  \\n \\n  The girl looked closely at him. \\\"You look different, but you\\n   \\n   are\\n   \\n  the\\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \\\"Yes, I'm all of\\nthem.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\\nwho go around changing their bodies like\\u2014like hats?\\\" Automatically she\\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\", \"Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\\nsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\\nhe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\\nthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\\nthe letter combination\\n   \\n   bodyguard\\n   \\n  , he went out into the street.\\n  \\n \\n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\\nyears.\\n  \\n \\n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \\\"Where to, fellow-man?\\\"\\nthe driver asked.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm new in the parish,\\\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Games?\\\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\\nwanted by then. \\\"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \\\"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I can't contact your attitude,\\\" the passenger said with a thin\\nsmile. \\\"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\\nthrill-mill.\\\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\\\" The driver spat out of the\\nwindow. \\\"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\\ncommission, wouldn't it?\\\" the other man asked coolly.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You're the dictator,\\\" the driver agreed sullenly.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  II\\n  \\n \\n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Let me take the controls, honey,\\\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\\nshook his handsome head.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\\\" he said thickly,\\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\\n  \\n \\n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\\n  \\n \\n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\\n  \\n \\n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\\nspeculatively. \\\"My guardian angel,\\\" he mumbled\\u2014shock had sobered him\\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \\\"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\\nthrown me back in.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"And that's no joke,\\\" the fat man agreed.\\n  \\n \\n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\\nthat he had not been alone. \\\"How about Helen? She on course?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Seems to be,\\\" the fat man said. \\\"You all right, miss?\\\" he asked,\\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Mrs.\\n   \\n  ,\\\" Gabriel corrected. \\\"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\\nLockard,\\\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\\n\\\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\\\" the fat man said,\\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \\\"I hope\\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\\\" The light given off by the flaming\\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\\n  \\n \\n  There were no public illuminators this far out\\u2014even in town the\\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\\nbeginning to slide downhill....\\n  \\n \\n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\"], \"found_information\": true}"

As a dynamic element, he drives the narrative forward, ensuring the safety and success of the protagonist. For instance, when the would-be thief flees from the zarquil game, the stranger examines the injured man and assures him that he will be all right. Additionally, in another scene, the stranger, who is also the man in the gray suit, saves the protagonist and his wife from a car crash by examining them and ensuring they are not seriously injured.

Those odd creatures from Altair's\\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\\u2014there has never been\\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\\n  \\n \\n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\\u2014as\\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\\nlaw\\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\\n  \\n \\n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\\n  \\n \\n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\\neverybody else far too well.\\n  \\n \\n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\\u2014hoping that eventually\\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\\n  \\n \\n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \\\"One?\\\" the small green\\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"One,\\\" the fat man answered.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  III\\n  \\n \\n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \\\"Only\\nweighted out,\\\" he muttered, \\\"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I really think Gabriel\\n   \\n   must\\n   \\n  be possessed....\\\" the girl said, mostly\\nto herself. \\\"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It does indeed,\\\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\\n  \\n \\n  The girl looked closely at him. \\\"You look different, but you\\n   \\n   are\\n   \\n  the\\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \\\"Yes, I'm all of\\nthem.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\\nwho go around changing their bodies like\\u2014like hats?\\\" Automatically she\\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\", \"Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\\nsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\\nhe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\\nthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\\nthe letter combination\\n   \\n   bodyguard\\n   \\n  , he went out into the street.\\n  \\n \\n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\\nyears.\\n  \\n \\n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \\\"Where to, fellow-man?\\\"\\nthe driver asked.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm new in the parish,\\\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Games?\\\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\\nwanted by then. \\\"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \\\"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I can't contact your attitude,\\\" the passenger said with a thin\\nsmile. \\\"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\\nthrill-mill.\\\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\\\" The driver spat out of the\\nwindow. \\\"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\\ncommission, wouldn't it?\\\" the other man asked coolly.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You're the dictator,\\\" the driver agreed sullenly.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  II\\n  \\n \\n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Let me take the controls, honey,\\\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\\nshook his handsome head.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\\\" he said thickly,\\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\\n  \\n \\n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\\n  \\n \\n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\\n  \\n \\n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\\nspeculatively. \\\"My guardian angel,\\\" he mumbled\\u2014shock had sobered him\\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \\\"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\\nthrown me back in.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"And that's no joke,\\\" the fat man agreed.\\n  \\n \\n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\\nthat he had not been alone. \\\"How about Helen? She on course?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Seems to be,\\\" the fat man said. \\\"You all right, miss?\\\" he asked,\\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Mrs.\\n   \\n  ,\\\" Gabriel corrected. \\\"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\\nLockard,\\\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\\n\\\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\\\" the fat man said,\\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \\\"I hope\\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\\\" The light given off by the flaming\\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\\n  \\n \\n  There were no public illuminators this far out\\u2014even in town the\\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\\nbeginning to slide downhill....\\n  \\n \\n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\"], \"found_information\": true}"

Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n  \n \n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n  \n \n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n  \n \n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n  \n \n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n  \n \n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n  \n \n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"I really think Gabriel\n   \n   must\n   \n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n  \n \n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n  \n \n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.",

So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.",

So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. 'Where to, fellow-man?'\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  'I'm new in the parish,' the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  'Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?'\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  'Games?' the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. 'Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?'\n  \n \n  'Is there a good zarquil game in town?'\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. 'Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.'\n  \n \n  'I can't contact your attitude,' the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. 'Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.' He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  'Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?' The driver spat out of the\nwindow. 'If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.'\n  \n \n  'But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?' the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  'Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.'\n  \n \n  'I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.'\n  \n \n  'You're the dictator,' the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  'Let me take the controls, honey,' the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  'Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,' he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. 'My guardian angel,' he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. 'Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.'\n  \n \n  'And that's no joke,' the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. 'How about Helen? She on course?'\n  \n \n  'Seems to be,' the fat man said. 'You all right, miss?' he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,' Gabriel corrected. 'Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,' he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n'Pretty bauble, isn't she?'\n  \n \n  'I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,' the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. 'I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.' The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n  \n \n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n  \n \n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n  \n \n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n  \n \n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n  \n \n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n  \n \n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"I really think Gabriel\n   \n   must\n   \n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n  \n \n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n  \n \n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\n\ndocument 2: Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\nsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\nhe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\nthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall.

Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n  \n \n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n  \n \n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n  \n \n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n  \n \n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n  \n \n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n  \n \n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"I really think Gabriel\n   \n   must\n   \n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n  \n \n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n  \n \n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.",

So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.",

If he did not have the incredible amounts of cash he has, he would not be able to keep up with this plan. But he is able to use his money to keep buying new bodies and chasing around Gabe. \n",
                        "The stranger in the gray suit is just one of the embodiments of the \u201cstranger\u201d throughout the story that keeps watch over Gabe. It is revealed that this stranger is actually Gabe himself who is continuously changing physical appearance by playing zarquil. He tries to take on bodies of greater and greater physical beauty until he can find one that is as good as the body he left, which he considers to be a perfect physical form. \n\nThe stranger is significant because he ultimately provides the key information that could liberate Helen from a marriage where she is treated poorly and gets into dangerous situations that could ultimately get her killed if she stays with him. \n\nThe stranger also represents the great lengths humans are willing to go to for pursuing or maintaining physical beauty or health. The game required to change form is dangerous and illegal, but the stranger continues to return to it for the allure of a better form.\n",
                        "The stranger in the gray suit at the bar is the real Gabriel Lockart. He lost his body to the man who currently inhabits it in a zarquil game after having too many drinks with him, and now he follows Gabe Lockart wherever he goes and protects him whenever he is in danger. Actually, the stranger is not protecting the person in Gabe Lockart\u2019s body, but the body of Gabe Lockart. The stranger shows up in the bar and protects Gabe when another man wants to throw a drink on Gabe; he also shows up and pulls Gabe and his wife from the wreckage of their helicar. He saves them from a would-be thief and calls for a cab to take them to where they are staying to prevent Gabe from freezing to death. The stranger follows Gabe wherever he goes, protecting his body. The stranger seems to want his body and identity back, but the current Gabe will not willingly give up the body and identity because he enjoys them too much.\n"

Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n  \n \n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n  \n \n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n  \n \n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n  \n \n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n  \n \n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n  \n \n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"I really think Gabriel\n   \n   must\n   \n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n  \n \n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n  \n \n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.",

So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

'No ma'am,\nyou'd have to stick to some great\nevent, both for the sake of actual\ninterest and for protection against being\nunmasked.'\n  \n \n  The old boy wound it up. 'Well,\nthat's the story.

Betty wailed.\n  \n \n  'Just for laughs,' Simon told the\ntwo of them sourly, 'suppose I tell\nyou a funny story.

I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n  \n \n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind.

Five million people\nattended annually.\n  \n \n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway.

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.",

I liked the way you\nknew my name when I walked in the\ndoor; my picture doesn't appear often\nin the papers.\"\n  \n \n  \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\nin his voice.\n  \n \n  \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\nyou bring me a time traveler.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out of the question,\" Simon\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   why\n   \n  ?\" Betty wailed.\n  \n \n  \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\ntwo of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\nyou a funny story. It goes like\nthis:\"\n  \n \n \n  I got a thousand dollars from Mr.\nOyster (Simon began) in the way\nof an advance, and leaving him with\nBetty who was making out a receipt,\nI hustled back to the apartment and\npacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\nanyway, this was a natural. On\nthe way to Idlewild I stopped off at\nthe Germany Information Offices for\nsome tourist literature.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly three and a half\nhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the\nfun I was going to have.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly seven and a half\nhours from Gander to Shannon and\nI spent that time dreaming up material\nI could put into my reports to\nMr. Oyster. I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n  \n \n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind. These statistics I read on\nthe\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people\nattended annually.\n  \n \n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway. I was stiff from the plane ride\nso I walked.",

Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\nin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\nfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\nwas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there were\nany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\nwere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\nangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\nstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\nlocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had\ndone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\nand Saiph ... it happened.\n  \n \n  The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\ncollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\nand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\nthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\nhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\ndangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\nthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\nit.\n  \n \n  McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n  \n \n  Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not\nquite utter silence.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\nlike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\nstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n  \n \n  Probably it was only an illusion.\n  \n \n  But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n  \n \n  It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\nfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n   \n   Starship Jodrell Bank\n   \n  to\nthis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\nhurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\nexasperation: 'If I could only\n   \n   see\n   \n  !'\n  \n \n  He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\nbaker's dough, not at all resilient.\n  \n \n  A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\nwas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\nin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\nfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\nwas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there were\nany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\nwere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\nangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\nstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\nlocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had\ndone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\nand Saiph ... it happened.\n  \n \n  The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\ncollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\nand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\nthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\nhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\ndangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\nthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\nit.\n  \n \n  McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n  \n \n  Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not\nquite utter silence.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\nlike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\nstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n  \n \n  Probably it was only an illusion.\n  \n \n  But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n  \n \n  It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\nfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n   \n   Starship Jodrell Bank\n   \n  to\nthis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\nhurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\nexasperation: \"If I could only\n   \n   see\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\nbaker's dough, not at all resilient.\n  \n \n  A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\nwas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.",

The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people\u2019s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program.

The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C.

                        "Grannie Annie,  a prolific science fiction novelist, goes to see Billy at a men\u2019s club. The two sit down to have a drink in an empty portion of the club, but they only have a minute to chat before Grannie Annie remembers she has an appointment at the Satellite Theater. She insists that Billy come with her. \n\nGrannie Annie forces Billy to take a seat in the audience, and she takes her place backstage. The show is called \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses,\u201d and it\u2019s a type of gameshow. People and creatures on nine different planets tune into the program, and they ask the geniuses questions. If the show\u2019s experts cannot answer the question, the listener gets a sum of money. Grannie Annie is there to serve as the guest star. \n\nThe show goes off without a hitch. The only remarkable thing that Billy notices is that the audience appears to be mesmerized by Dr. Universe. \n\nGrannie Annie tells Billy that while she was writing a sequel to her latest novel, she met Ezra Karn, and he told her about the Green Flames. The Green Flame is a radioactive rock originally found on Mercury, and the rock\u2019s Gamma Rays have the power to make people and creatures have a strong desire for a leader. Grannie Annie included these fantastical ideas in her recent novel, but her manuscript was stolen. Now, she\u2019s concerned that the rocks and rays will be used by an authoritarian leader. \n\nIn the middle of their conversation, Grannie Annie and Billy are attacked by someone with a heat ray. The pair leaves Swamp City, followed by the enemy. They travel and find Ezra Karn in his home. \n\nKarn takes his friends to the spaceship where the Green Flames are stored. The precious resource is behind impenetrable glass, and it\u2019s clear that whoever controls it made sure it was safe. \n\nKarn is an avid Doctor Universe fan, and he off-handedly tells Grannie Annie and Billy that they ought to make the man the king. Grannie Annie realizes that Doctor Universe is in fact the person hoarding the Green Flames, and he\u2019s using his quiz show to control the minds of the masses so that he can take over as dictator. \n\nWithout warning, Billy and his friends feel an invisible force pushing them and holding down their bodies. They recognize force as the Varsoom, and the only way to stop it is to make them laugh. Grannie Annie builds a machine that allows the group to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast. \n\nWhen Doctor Universe comes on the radio again, Grannie Annie reads one of her science fiction books to the invisible creatures. The plan works, and the Varsoom laugh wildly, which ruins the Doctor\u2019s plans to take over the universe. Grannie Annie says it won\u2019t deter her from writing her novels, and she invites Billy to come along for the research portion of her next project. \n\n",
                        "The story starts in a club on Venus, in Swamp City. The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people\u2019s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra\u2019s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book. Their laughter made it into the broadcast, thwarting Doctor Universe\u2019s plans for becoming dictator of the solar system. In the end, Grannie decides she wants to keep writing novels and invites Billy on a trip to Mars for background research for her next book.",
                        "Billy is playing pool when his grandmother attempts to enter the male-only Spacemen\u2019s Club in Venus. He runs out to meet her in the lobby then takes her up to the grille where she won\u2019t be seen. They share a drink, while he asks her what she\u2019s doing in town. Grannie Annie, better known as Annabella C. Flowers, is a popular science fiction writer. Before she can explain her arrival, she rushes to the Satellite Theater, taking Billy with her. She\u2019s a participant in the Doctor Universe game show, and she wants Billy to watch. \nAfter the show is over, a racist interaction takes place. The I.P. comes around to break it up, but not before one Kagor was seriously hurt. \nGrannie Annie takes Billy into another restaurant and finally explains herself. She was writing a sequel for her last book and was doing research on Venus. There she met Ezra Karn, an older man with plenty of stories to tell. He told her of the Green Flames, an ore that released gamma rays stronger than any drug known to man. They made people receptive and easily manipulated. \nShe wrote a book about it and included many facts that Karn told her, including the location of the remaining Green Flames. The manuscript was stolen, and now she believes that this person is using the Geren Flame to control people. \nBilly immediately thinks the suspect is Doctor Universe, but Grannie blows him off. She thinks that someone has figured out a way to broadcast the emissions. A heat ray blasts toward them, almost killing Grannie Annie. They rush to the hydrocar and get out of there. \nFinally, they reach Level Five close to Vansoom territory, where Karn lives. The Vansooms are energy creatures, extremely dangerous, and volatile. They take a boat, where a trained hunter-bird attacks them. They survive thanks to Grannie\u2019s shooting skills. They meet Karn at last and he agrees to show them to the shipwreck after they listen to the latest Doctor Universe gameshow. \nThey reach the ship and see that someone has added to it. A network of wires ran across the shipwreck, protected by impenetrable glass. As was the Green Flames. Since they weren\u2019t able to destroy it, the team sets up camp and hatches a new plan. \nAfter being attacked by the Vansooms, they realize that laughter is the only way to fend them off. Grannie Annie decides to broadcast the Vansooms\u2019 laughter over the next Doctor Universe gameshow, where he is to announce his incoming dictatorship. They spend the next day attempting to make the Vansoom\u2019s laugh but only succeed when Grannie Annie reads a chapter from her most popular novel. They broadcast their laughter over Doctor Universe and override his cry for power. \nThey make their way back home, a longer journey thanks to the Vansoom, and are greeted by the news that Doctor Universe failed. Grannie invites Billy to Mars where she will research her next novel.\n",
                        "In a future where all planets of the solar system have been colonized, the narrative tells the story of an adventure with science fiction novelist Grannie Annie and her acquaintance Billy Boy.\n\nAnnie has begun to notice that populations in the solar system are displaying curious tendencies. Overall intellectual lethargy and a clear preference to be led by a despot or dictator. Theorizing that this behavior is the result of exposure to a unique radiation of the Green Flame rock, Annie and Billy investigate in the back country of Venus. As they hunt for an answer they are threatened by would-be assassins who are intent on stopping them. \n\nEventually they uncover that quiz show host, Doctor Universe, is amplifying radiation from a cache of Green Flame and broadcasting it throughout the solar system through his visi program. Annie foils his scheme by broadcasting the laughter of the Varsoom as Doctor Universe tries to announce himself as System Dictator. The story ends as Grannie Annie heads off to Mars with Billy Boy understanding that he was fated to join her in her next adventure."

Barr, have you ever thought much\\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Not especially, sir,\\\" he mumbled.\\n  \\n \\n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\\nconversation to the professor.\\n  \\n \\n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You know what I mean, of course,\\\" Kesserich pressed. \\\"The factors that\\nmake you you, and me me.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Heredity and environment,\\\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\\n  \\n \\n  Kesserich nodded. \\\"Suppose\\u2014this is just speculation\\u2014that we could\\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\\nindividual at will.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \\\"To get exactly the same pattern of\\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"What about identical twins?\\\" Kesserich pointed out. \\\"And then there's\\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\\nmother without the intervention of the male.\\\" Although his voice had\\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\\nsecretly. \\\"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \\\"Even then you wouldn't get\\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\\nmother's traits?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But environment would change things,\\\" Jack objected. \\\"The duplicate\\nwould be bound to develop differently.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\\nsimilar. But suppose you did try.

The colonists have had\\nno more than a century of freedom\\nsince the Bees pulled out,\\nand four generations simply\\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\\nculture to climb from\\nslavery to interstellar flight.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker made a padding turn\\nabout the control room, tugging\\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\\nof hair the years had left him.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"If they're neither Hymenops\\nnor resurgent colonists,\\\" he said,\\n\\\"then there's only one choice remaining\\u2014they're\\naliens from a\\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\\nexploration.

The same objection\\nthat rules out the Bees applies\\nto any trans-Alphardian\\nculture\\u2014they'd have to be beyond\\nthe atomic fission stage,\\nelse they'd never have attempted\\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\\napplications is the\\nonly answer to long-range travel,\\nand if they'd had that they\\nwouldn't have bothered with\\natomics.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker turned on him almost\\nangrily. \\\"If they're not Hymenops\\nor humans or aliens, then\\nwhat in God's name\\n   \\n   are\\n   \\n  they?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\\"Aye, there's the rub,\\\" Farrell\\nsaid, quoting a passage\\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\\nit through a dozen reorganizations\\nof insular tongue and a\\nfinal translation to universal\\nTerran. \\\"If they're none of those\\nthree, we've only one conclusion\\nleft.

But that same hard experience\\nhad honed rather than\\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\\nstalking of an unknown\\nand patently hostile force was\\nanything but attractive.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You two did the field work\\non the last location,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"It's high time I took my turn\\u2014and\\nGod knows I'd go mad if\\nI had to stay inship and listen\\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\\ndead languages with Xavier.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker laughed for the first\\ntime since the explosion that\\nhad so nearly wrecked the\\n   \\n   Marco\\nFour\\n   \\n  .\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Good enough. Though it\\nwouldn't be more diverting to\\nlisten for hours to you improvising\\nenharmonic variations on\\nthe\\n   \\n   Lament for Old Terra\\n   \\n  with\\nyour accordion.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson, characteristically, had\\na refinement to offer.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"They'll be alerted down there\\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\\\" he\\nsaid. \\\"Why not let Xavier take\\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\\nand drop Arthur off in\\nthe helihopper for a low-level\\ncheck?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \\\"All\\nright, Arthur?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Good enough,\\\" Farrell said.\\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\\n\\\"How does it look,\\nXav? Have you pinned down\\ntheir base yet?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical answered him\\nin a voice as smooth and clear\\u2014and\\nas inflectionless\\u2014as a 'cello\\nnote. \\\"The planet seems uninhabited\\nexcept for a large island\\nsome three hundred miles in\\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\\nby cultivated fields.\\nThere is one city of perhaps a\\nthousand buildings with a central\\nsquare. In the square rests\\na grounded spaceship of approximately\\nten times the bulk\\nof the\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  .\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  They crowded about the vision\\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\\ngray shape in their interest. The\\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\\nbefore them, the battered\\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\\nrustily in the late afternoon\\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\\nthe whole so clearly\\ndepicted that they could see the\\nthrongs of people surging up\\nand down, tiny foreshortened\\nfaces turned toward the sky.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"At least they're human,\\\"\\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\\n\\\"Which means that they're\\nTerran, and can be dealt with\\naccording to Reclamations routine.\\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\\nXav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\\nthe convention vibrato that\\nindicated stark puzzlement. \\\"Its\\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\\nof flight. Apparently it\\nis used only to supply power to\\nthe outlying hamlets.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical put a flexible\\ngray finger upon an indicator\\ngraph derived from a composite\\nsection of detector meters. \\\"The\\npower transmitted seems to be\\ngross electric current conveyed\\nby metallic cables. It is generated\\nthrough a crudely governed\\nprocess of continuous atomic\\nfission.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Farrell, himself appalled by\\nthe information, still found himself\\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\\nbellow of consternation.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Continuous fission?\\n   \\n  Good\\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\\nrun a risk like that!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell prodded him with\\ncheerful malice. \\\"Why say mad\\n   \\n   men\\n   \\n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\\nand look on the danger of\\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\\nof the night as a satisfactory\\nrisk.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"They're not alien,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid positively. \\\"Their architecture\\nis Terran, and so is their\\nship. The ship is incredibly\\nprimitive, though; those batteries\\nof tubes at either end\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Are thrust reaction jets,\\\"\\nStryker finished in an awed\\nvoice. \\\"Primitive isn't the word,\\nGib\\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\\nused in spacecraft since\\u2014how\\nlong, Xav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier supplied the information\\nwith mechanical infallibility.\\n\\\"Since the year 2100 when\\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\\nprinciple was discovered.\\nThat principle has served\\nmen since.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\\nat the anomalous craft on\\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\\nhad said, was not the word\\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\\nand bristling at either end with\\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\\ncenter of its square like a rusted\\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\\nand all but forgotten. What a\\nmagnificent disregard its builders\\nmust have had, he thought,\\nfor their lives and the genetic\\npurity of their posterity! The\\nsullen atomic fires banked in\\nthat oxidizing hulk\\u2014\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker said plaintively, \\\"If\\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\\nmore in the dark than ever. How\\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\\nhundred years old get\\n   \\n   here\\n   \\n  ?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\\ncontemplation of alternatives,\\nseemed hardly to hear\\nhim.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Logic or not-logic,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid. \\\"If it's a Terran artifact,\\nwe can discover the reason for\\nits presence.

We've\\ngot to determine first which case\\napplies here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  He waited for Farrell's expected\\nirony, and when the\\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\\ngrimly quiet, continued.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"The obvious premise is that\\na Terran ship must have been\\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\\nit flown here, or built here?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It couldn't have been built\\nhere,\\\" Stryker said. \\\"Alphard\\nSix was surveyed just before the\\nBees took over in 3025, and there\\nwas nothing of the sort here\\nthen. It couldn't have been built\\nduring the two and a quarter\\ncenturies since; it's obviously\\nmuch older than that. It was\\nflown here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We progress,\\\" Farrell said\\ndryly. \\\"Now if you'll tell us\\n   \\n   how\\n   \\n  ,\\nwe're ready to move.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I think the ship was built on\\nTerra during the Twenty-second\\nCentury,\\\" Gibson said calmly.\\n\\\"The atomic wars during that\\nperiod destroyed practically all\\nhistorical records along with the\\ntechnology of the time, but I've\\nread well-authenticated reports\\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\\nTerra before then for the nearer\\nstars. The human race climbed\\nout of its pit again during the\\nTwenty-third Century and developed\\nthe technology that gave\\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\\natomic-powered ships were built\\nafter the wars\\u2014our records are\\ncomplete from that time.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell shook his head at the\\ninference. \\\"I've read any number\\nof fanciful romances on the\\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\\nup in practice. No shipboard society\\ncould last through a thousand-year\\nspace voyage. It's a\\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\\nThere's got to be\\nsome other explanation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Gibson shrugged. \\\"We can\\nonly eliminate the least likely\\nalternatives and accept the simplest\\none remaining.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Then we can eliminate this\\none now,\\\" Farrell said flatly. \\\"It\\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\\nwhich is an impossibility for any\\ngross reaction drive; the application\\nof suspended animation\\nor longevity or a successive-generation\\nprogram, and a final\\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\\nspace to set up a colony under\\nthe very antennae of the\\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\\nuntil around the year 3000\\u2014Lee\\nhere was one of the first to\\nprofit by it, if you remember\\u2014and\\nsuspended animation is still\\nto come. So there's one theory\\nyou can forget.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Arthur's right,\\\" Stryker said\\nreluctantly. \\\"An atomic-powered\\nship\\n   \\n   couldn't\\n   \\n  have made such a\\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\\nproject couldn't have\\nlasted through forty generations,\\nspeculative fiction to the\\ncontrary\\u2014the later generations\\nwould have been too far removed\\nin ideology and intent from\\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\\nadapted to shipboard life as the\\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\\nphysically, perhaps even have\\nmutated\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"And they'd never have\\nfought past the Bees during the\\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\\\"\\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\\n\\\"The Bees had better\\ndetection equipment than we\\nhad. They'd have picked this\\nship up long before it reached\\nAlphard Six.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But the ship wasn't here in\\n3000,\\\" Gibson said, \\\"and it is\\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\\nat some time during the\\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\\noccupation and evacuation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\\nswore bitterly. \\\"But\\nwhy should the Bees let them\\nthrough? The three domes on\\nFive are over two hundred years\\nold, which means that the Bees\\nwere here before the ship came.\\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\\nits crew?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We haven't touched on all the\\npossibilities,\\\" Gibson reminded\\nhim. \\\"We haven't even established\\nyet that these people were\\nnever under Hymenop control.\\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\\nthe motives of an alien\\nrace. We never understood the\\nHymenops because there's no\\ncommon ground of logic between\\nus. Why try to interpret their\\nintentions now?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell threw up his hands in\\ndisgust. \\\"Next you'll say this is\\nan ancient Terran expedition\\nthat actually succeeded! There's\\nonly one way to answer the\\nquestions we've raised, and\\nthat's to go down and see for\\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\\nat him when Farrell found\\nhimself alone in the helihopper\\nwith the forest flowing beneath\\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\\ninto the dusk ahead.\\n  \\n \\n  We never found a colony so\\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\\nthat really paid off? The\\nBees did some weird and wonderful\\nthings with human\\nguinea pigs\\u2014what if they've\\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\\nmyrmidons in our own\\nform?\\n  \\n \\n  Suppose, he thought\\u2014and derided\\nhimself for thinking it\\u2014one\\nof those suicidal old interstellar\\nventures\\n   \\n   did\\n   \\n  succeed?\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\\ndrone from the helihopper's\\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\\nsharply into his musing. \\\"The\\nship has discovered the scouter\\nand is training an electronic\\nbeam upon it. My instruments\\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\\npattern of low power but\\nrapidly varying frequency. The\\noperation seems pointless.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\\nwith worry: \\\"I'd better\\npull Xav back. It may be something\\nlethal.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Don't,\\\" Gibson's baritone advised.\\nSurprisingly, there was\\nexcitement in the engineer's\\nvoice. \\\"I think they're trying to\\ncommunicate with us.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell was on the point of\\ndemanding acidly to know how\\none went about communicating\\nby means of a fluctuating electric\\nfield when the unexpected\\ncessation of forest diverted his\\nattention. The helihopper scudded\\nover a cultivated area\\nof considerable extent, fields\\nstretching below in a vague random\\ncheckerboard of lighter and\\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\\nof buildings at their center.\\nThere was a central bonfire that\\nburned like a wild red eye\\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\\nfigures.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm passing over a hamlet,\\\"\\nFarrell reported. \\\"The one nearest\\nthe city, I think. There's\\nsomething odd going on\\ndown\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\\nthat he was caught completely\\nunprepared. The helihopper's\\nflimsy carriage bucked and\\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\\nflare of electric discharge, a\\npungent stink of ozone and a\\nstunning shock that flung him\\nheadlong into darkness.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\\nheadache and a conviction of\\nnightmare heightened by the\\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\\nof tables and lockers and chests.\\nThe lighting was harsh and\\noverbright and the air hung\\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\\nfar off yet at the same\\ntime as near as the bulkhead\\nabove him, came the unceasing\\ndrone of machinery.\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\\nwhen full consciousness made his\\nposition clear. He had been shot\\ndown by God knew what sort of\\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\\nand was a prisoner in the\\ngrounded ship.\\n  \\n \\n  At his rising, a white-smocked\\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\\nand close-cropped gray\\nhair came into the room, moving\\nwith the professional assurance\\nof a medic. The man stopped\\nshort at Farrell's stare and\\nspoke; his words were utterly\\nunintelligible, but his gesture\\nwas unmistakable.\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell followed him dumbly\\nout of the infirmary and down\\na bare corridor whose metal\\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\\nopen port near the corridor's end\\nrelieved the blankness of wall\\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\\nto look out, wondering how\\nlong he had lain unconscious,\\nand felt panic knife at him\\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\\nport open and undefended,\\non the square outside.\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical had been as\\neasily taken as himself, then.\\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\\nprofessional caution, would fare\\nno better\\u2014they could not have\\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\\nand Xavier, and when they\\ntried as a matter of course to\\nrescue them the\\n   \\n   Marco\\n   \\n  would be\\nstruck down in turn by the same\\nweapon.\\n  \\n \\n  The fat medic turned and\\nsaid something urgent in his\\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\\ndazed by the enormity of what\\nhad happened, followed without\\nprotest into an intersecting way\\nthat led through a bewildering\\nsuccession of storage rooms and\\nhydroponics gardens, through a\\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\\nphysical training equipment in\\ngraduated sizes and finally into\\na soundproofed place that could\\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\\n  \\n \\n  The implication behind its\\npresence stopped Farrell short.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"A\\n   \\n   creche\\n   \\n  ,\\\" he said, stunned.\\nHe had a wild vision of endless\\ngenerations of children growing\\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\\nto be taught from their first\\ntoddling steps the functions they\\nmust fulfill before the venture\\nof which they were a part could\\nbe consummated.\\n  \\n \\n  One of those old ventures\\n   \\n   had\\n   \\n  succeeded, he thought, and was\\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\\nodyssey. The realization\\nleft him more alarmed than\\nbefore\\u2014for what technical marvels\\nmight not an isolated group\\nof such dogged specialists have\\ndeveloped during a millennium\\nof application?\\n  \\n \\n  Such a weapon as had brought\\ndown the helihopper and scouter\\nwas patently beyond reach of his\\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\\nhe thought, its possession\\nexplained the presence of these\\npeople here in the first stronghold\\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\\nthey had even fought and defeated\\nthe Bees on their own invaded\\nground.\\n  \\n \\n  He followed his white-smocked\\nguide through a power room\\nwhere great crude generators\\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\\nout gross electric current into\\narm-thick cables. They were\\nnearing the bow of the ship\\nwhen they passed by another\\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\\nout over the lowered rampway,\\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\\nand Gibson had been well\\ngrounded.\\n  \\n \\n  The\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  , ports open,\\nlay grounded outside.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Farrell could not have said,\\nlater, whether his next move\\nwas planned or reflexive. The\\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\\nhang suspended for a breathless\\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\\ndecision, and in that instant he\\nmade his bid.\\n  \\n \\n  Without pausing in his stride\\nhe sprang out and through the\\nport and down the steep plane\\nof the ramp. The rough stone\\npavement of the square drummed\\nunderfoot; sore muscles\\ntore at him, and weakness was\\nlike a weight about his neck. He\\nexpected momentarily to be\\nblasted out of existence.\\n  \\n \\n  He reached the\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  with the startled shouts of his\\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\\nplunged inside and stabbed at\\ncontrols without waiting to seat\\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\\nThe ship darted up under his\\nmanipulation and arrowed into\\nspace with an acceleration that\\nsprung his knees and made his\\nvision swim blackly.\\n  \\n \\n  He was so weak with strain\\nand with the success of his coup\\nthat he all but fainted when\\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\\nstumbled out of his\\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\\nhim.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"What the hell are you doing,\\nArthur? Take us down!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker lumbered past him\\nand took the controls, spiraling\\nthe\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  down. Men\\nswarmed outside the ports when\\nthe Reclamations craft settled\\ngently to the square again. Gibson\\nand Xavier reached the ship\\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\\nleaving the mechanical outside\\nmaking patient explanations\\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\\non Farrell's arm. \\\"It's all right,\\nArthur. There's no trouble.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell said dumbly, \\\"I don't\\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\\nyou and Xav down too?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"No one shot you down! These\\npeople are primitive enough to\\nuse metallic power lines to\\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\\nan anachronism you forgot\\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\\ninto one of those lines,\\nand the crash put you out for\\nthe rest of the night and most\\nof today. These Alphardians are\\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\\nbe found again that it's really\\npathetic.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Friendly?\\n   \\n  That torpedo\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\\\"\\nStryker put in. Understanding\\nof the error under which Farrell\\nhad labored erased his\\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\\ncommiseratingly. \\\"They had\\none small boat left for emergency\\nmissions, and sent it up to\\ncontact us in the fear that we\\nmight overlook their settlement\\nand move on. The boat was\\natomic powered, and our shield\\nscreens set off its engines.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\\nand his head ached dully.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We cracked the communications\\nproblem early last night,\\\"\\nGibson said. \\\"These people use\\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\\nwave propagation called\\nfrequency modulation, and once\\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\\nold language; the natives reported\\nyour accident, and we came\\ndown at once.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"They really came from Terra?\\nThey lived through a thousand\\nyears of flight?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"The ship left Terra for\\nSirius in 2171,\\\" Gibson said.\\n\\\"But not with these people\\naboard, or their ancestors. That\\nexpedition perished after less\\nthan a light-year when its\\nhydroponics system failed. The\\nHymenops found the ship derelict\\nwhen they invaded us, and\\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\\nwhat was probably their first experiment\\nwith human subjects.\\nThe ship's log shows clearly\\nwhat happened to the original\\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\\nfrom the situation here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell put his hands to his\\ntemples and groaned. \\\"The crash\\nmust have scrambled my wits.\\nGib, where\\n   \\n   did\\n   \\n  they come from?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"From one of the first peripheral\\ncolonies conquered by the\\nBees,\\\" Gibson said patiently.\\n\\\"The Hymenops were long-range\\nplanners, remember, and masters\\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\\nstocked the ship with a captive\\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\\nbelieve themselves descendants\\nof the original crew, and\\ngrounded it here in disabled\\ncondition. They left for Alphard\\nFive then, to watch developments.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Succeeding generations of\\ncolonists grew up accepting the\\nfact that their ship had missed\\nSirius and made planetfall here\\u2014they\\nstill don't know where\\nthey really are\\u2014by luck. They\\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\\nand they've struggled along\\nwith an inadequate technology in\\nthe hope that a later expedition\\nwould find them. They found the\\ntruth hard to take, but they're\\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\\nassimilation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker, grinning, brought\\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\\ninvitingly. \\\"An unusually\\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\\nexperiment,\\\" he said. \\\"These\\npeople progressed normally because\\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\\nthem will be a simple\\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\\ncolonists within another generation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But I don't see why the Bees\\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\\nthese people. Why did they\\nsit back and let them grow as\\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\\nmake sense!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But it does, for once,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid. \\\"The Bees set up this\\ncolony as a control unit to study\\nthe species they were invading,\\nand they had to give their\\nspecimens a normal\\u2014if obsolete\\u2014background\\nin order to determine\\ntheir capabilities. The fact\\nthat their experiment didn't tell\\nthem what they wanted to know\\nmay have had a direct bearing\\non their decision to pull out.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell shook his head. \\\"It's\\na reverse application, isn't it of\\nthe old saw about Terrans being\\nincapable of understanding an\\nalien culture?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Of course,\\\" said Gibson, surprised.\\n\\\"It's obvious enough,\\nsurely\\u2014hard as they tried, the\\nBees never understood us\\neither.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  THE END\\n  \\n \\n  Transcriber's Note:\\n  \\n \\n This etext was produced from\\n  \\n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\\n  \\n January\\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Not especially, sir,\\\" he mumbled.\\n  \\n \\n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\\nconversation to the professor.\\n  \\n \\n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You know what I mean, of course,\\\" Kesserich pressed. \\\"The factors that\\nmake you you, and me me.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Heredity and environment,\\\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\\n  \\n \\n  Kesserich nodded. \\\"Suppose\\u2014this is just speculation\\u2014that we could\\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\\nindividual at will.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \\\"To get exactly the same pattern of\\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"What about identical twins?\\\" Kesserich pointed out. \\\"And then there's\\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\\nmother without the intervention of the male.\\\" Although his voice had\\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\\nsecretly. \\\"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \\\"Even then you wouldn't get\\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\\nmother's traits?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But environment would change things,\\\" Jack objected. \\\"The duplicate\\nwould be bound to develop differently.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\\nsphinx-like face.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\\\"\\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\\n\\\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Jack looked at him blankly.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\\\" the biologist\\nexplained.\", \"The\\n  cool green disk of Alphard\\nSix on the screen was\\ninfinitely welcome after the arid\\ndesolation and stinking swamplands\\nof the inner planets, an\\nairy jewel of a world that might\\nhave been designed specifically\\nfor the hard-earned month of\\nrest ahead.

He\\nnearly added\\n   \\n   as usual\\n   \\n  . \\\"We're on\\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\\nbut our mission is still to find\\nTerran colonies enslaved and\\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\\nrisk our necks and a valuable\\nReorientations ship by landing\\nblind on an unobserved planet.\\nWe're too close already. Cut in\\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\\nspiral, will you?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\\nboard that lifted the\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  out of her descent and restored\\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\\nher repellors.\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker's caution was justified\\non the instant.

And that means we'll\\nhave to rule out any resurgent\\ncolonial group down there, because\\nSix never had a colony in\\nthe beginning.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"The Bees have been gone for\\nover a hundred years,\\\" Stryker\\nsaid. \\\"Colonists might have migrated\\nfrom another Terran-occupied\\nplanet.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson disagreed.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We've touched at every inhabited\\nworld in this sector, Lee,\\nand not one surviving colony has\\ndeveloped space travel on its\\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\\nyears to condition their human\\nslaves to ignorance of\\neverything beyond their immediate\\nenvironment\\u2014the motives\\nbehind that conditioning usually\\nescape us, but that's beside the\\npoint\\u2014and they did a thorough\\njob of it. The colonists have had\\nno more than a century of freedom\\nsince the Bees pulled out,\\nand four generations simply\\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\\nculture to climb from\\nslavery to interstellar flight.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker made a padding turn\\nabout the control room, tugging\\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\\nof hair the years had left him.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"If they're neither Hymenops\\nnor resurgent colonists,\\\" he said,\\n\\\"then there's only one choice remaining\\u2014they're\\naliens from a\\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\\nexploration. We always assumed\\nthat we'd find other races out\\nhere someday, and that they'd\\nbe as different from us in form\\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\\nWhy not now?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson said seriously, \\\"Not\\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\\nthat rules out the Bees applies\\nto any trans-Alphardian\\nculture\\u2014they'd have to be beyond\\nthe atomic fission stage,\\nelse they'd never have attempted\\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\\napplications is the\\nonly answer to long-range travel,\\nand if they'd had that they\\nwouldn't have bothered with\\natomics.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker turned on him almost\\nangrily. \\\"If they're not Hymenops\\nor humans or aliens, then\\nwhat in God's name\\n   \\n   are\\n   \\n  they?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\\"Aye, there's the rub,\\\" Farrell\\nsaid, quoting a passage\\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\\nit through a dozen reorganizations\\nof insular tongue and a\\nfinal translation to universal\\nTerran. \\\"If they're none of those\\nthree, we've only one conclusion\\nleft. There's no one down there\\nat all\\u2014we're victims of the first\\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\\nhistory.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker threw up his hands in\\nsurrender. \\\"We can't identify\\nthem by theorizing, and that\\nbrings us down to the business\\nof first-hand investigation.\\nWho's going to bell the cat this\\ntime?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'd like to go,\\\" Gibson said\\nat once. \\\"The ZIT computer can\\nwait.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\\npromptly. \\\"No, the ZIT comes\\nfirst.

It's\\ngot to be me or Arthur.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\\nof uneasiness that inevitably\\npreceded this moment of decision.\\nHe was not lacking in courage,\\nelse the circumstances under\\nwhich he had worked for the\\npast ten years\\u2014the sometimes\\nperilous, sometimes downright\\ncharnel conditions left by the\\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\\u2014would\\nhave broken him long\\nago. But that same hard experience\\nhad honed rather than\\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\\nstalking of an unknown\\nand patently hostile force was\\nanything but attractive.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"You two did the field work\\non the last location,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"It's high time I took my turn\\u2014and\\nGod knows I'd go mad if\\nI had to stay inship and listen\\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\\ndead languages with Xavier.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker laughed for the first\\ntime since the explosion that\\nhad so nearly wrecked the\\n   \\n   Marco\\nFour\\n   \\n  .\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Good enough.

Have you pinned down\\ntheir base yet?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical answered him\\nin a voice as smooth and clear\\u2014and\\nas inflectionless\\u2014as a 'cello\\nnote. \\\"The planet seems uninhabited\\nexcept for a large island\\nsome three hundred miles in\\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\\nby cultivated fields.\\nThere is one city of perhaps a\\nthousand buildings with a central\\nsquare. In the square rests\\na grounded spaceship of approximately\\nten times the bulk\\nof the\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  .\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  They crowded about the vision\\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\\ngray shape in their interest. The\\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\\nbefore them, the battered\\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\\nrustily in the late afternoon\\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\\nthe whole so clearly\\ndepicted that they could see the\\nthrongs of people surging up\\nand down, tiny foreshortened\\nfaces turned toward the sky.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"At least they're human,\\\"\\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\\n\\\"Which means that they're\\nTerran, and can be dealt with\\naccording to Reclamations routine.\\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\\nXav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\\nthe convention vibrato that\\nindicated stark puzzlement. \\\"Its\\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\\nof flight. Apparently it\\nis used only to supply power to\\nthe outlying hamlets.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical put a flexible\\ngray finger upon an indicator\\ngraph derived from a composite\\nsection of detector meters. \\\"The\\npower transmitted seems to be\\ngross electric current conveyed\\nby metallic cables. It is generated\\nthrough a crudely governed\\nprocess of continuous atomic\\nfission.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Farrell, himself appalled by\\nthe information, still found himself\\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\\nbellow of consternation.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Continuous fission?\\n   \\n  Good\\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\\nrun a risk like that!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell prodded him with\\ncheerful malice. \\\"Why say mad\\n   \\n   men\\n   \\n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\\nand look on the danger of\\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\\nof the night as a satisfactory\\nrisk.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"They're not alien,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid positively. \\\"Their architecture\\nis Terran, and so is their\\nship. The ship is incredibly\\nprimitive, though; those batteries\\nof tubes at either end\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Are thrust reaction jets,\\\"\\nStryker finished in an awed\\nvoice. \\\"Primitive isn't the word,\\nGib\\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\\nused in spacecraft since\\u2014how\\nlong, Xav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier supplied the information\\nwith mechanical infallibility.\\n\\\"Since the year 2100 when\\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\\nprinciple was discovered.\\nThat principle has served\\nmen since.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\\nat the anomalous craft on\\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\\nhad said, was not the word\\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\\nand bristling at either end with\\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\\ncenter of its square like a rusted\\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\\nand all but forgotten. What a\\nmagnificent disregard its builders\\nmust have had, he thought,\\nfor their lives and the genetic\\npurity of their posterity! The\\nsullen atomic fires banked in\\nthat oxidizing hulk\\u2014\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker said plaintively, \\\"If\\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\\nmore in the dark than ever. How\\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\\nhundred years old get\\n   \\n   here\\n   \\n  ?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\\ncontemplation of alternatives,\\nseemed hardly to hear\\nhim.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Logic or not-logic,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid. \\\"If it's a Terran artifact,\\nwe can discover the reason for\\nits presence. If not\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Any problem posed by one\\ngroup of human beings\\n   \\n  ,\\\" Stryker\\nquoted his Handbook, \\\"\\n   \\n   can be\\nresolved by any other group, regardless\\nof ideology or conditioning,\\nbecause the basic\\nperceptive abilities of both must\\nbe the same through identical\\nheredity\\n   \\n  .\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"If it's an imitation, and this\\nis another Hymenop experiment\\nin condition ecology, then we're\\nstumped to begin with,\\\" Gibson\\nfinished. \\\"Because we're not\\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\\nof alien motivation. We've\\ngot to determine first which case\\napplies here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  He waited for Farrell's expected\\nirony, and when the\\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\\ngrimly quiet, continued.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"The obvious premise is that\\na Terran ship must have been\\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\\nit flown here, or built here?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It couldn't have been built\\nhere,\\\" Stryker said. \\\"Alphard\\nSix was surveyed just before the\\nBees took over in 3025, and there\\nwas nothing of the sort here\\nthen. It couldn't have been built\\nduring the two and a quarter\\ncenturies since; it's obviously\\nmuch older than that. It was\\nflown here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We progress,\\\" Farrell said\\ndryly. \\\"Now if you'll tell us\\n   \\n   how\\n   \\n  ,\\nwe're ready to move.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I think the ship was built on\\nTerra during the Twenty-second\\nCentury,\\\" Gibson said calmly.\\n\\\"The atomic wars during that\\nperiod destroyed practically all\\nhistorical records along with the\\ntechnology of the time, but I've\\nread well-authenticated reports\\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\\nTerra before then for the nearer\\nstars. The human race climbed\\nout of its pit again during the\\nTwenty-third Century and developed\\nthe technology that gave\\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\\natomic-powered ships were built\\nafter the wars\\u2014our records are\\ncomplete from that time.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell shook his head at the\\ninference. \\\"I've read any number\\nof fanciful romances on the\\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\\nup in practice. No shipboard society\\ncould last through a thousand-year\\nspace voyage. It's a\\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\\nThere's got to be\\nsome other explanation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Gibson shrugged. \\\"We can\\nonly eliminate the least likely\\nalternatives and accept the simplest\\none remaining.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Then we can eliminate this\\none now,\\\" Farrell said flatly. \\\"It\\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\\nwhich is an impossibility for any\\ngross reaction drive; the application\\nof suspended animation\\nor longevity or a successive-generation\\nprogram, and a final\\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\\nspace to set up a colony under\\nthe very antennae of the\\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\\nuntil around the year 3000\\u2014Lee\\nhere was one of the first to\\nprofit by it, if you remember\\u2014and\\nsuspended animation is still\\nto come. So there's one theory\\nyou can forget.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Arthur's right,\\\" Stryker said\\nreluctantly. \\\"An atomic-powered\\nship\\n   \\n   couldn't\\n   \\n  have made such a\\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\\nproject couldn't have\\nlasted through forty generations,\\nspeculative fiction to the\\ncontrary\\u2014the later generations\\nwould have been too far removed\\nin ideology and intent from\\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\\nadapted to shipboard life as the\\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\\nphysically, perhaps even have\\nmutated\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"And they'd never have\\nfought past the Bees during the\\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\\\"\\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\\n\\\"The Bees had better\\ndetection equipment than we\\nhad. They'd have picked this\\nship up long before it reached\\nAlphard Six.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But the ship wasn't here in\\n3000,\\\" Gibson said, \\\"and it is\\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\\nat some time during the\\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\\noccupation and evacuation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\\nswore bitterly. \\\"But\\nwhy should the Bees let them\\nthrough? The three domes on\\nFive are over two hundred years\\nold, which means that the Bees\\nwere here before the ship came.\\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\\nits crew?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We haven't touched on all the\\npossibilities,\\\" Gibson reminded\\nhim. \\\"We haven't even established\\nyet that these people were\\nnever under Hymenop control.\\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\\nthe motives of an alien\\nrace. We never understood the\\nHymenops because there's no\\ncommon ground of logic between\\nus. Why try to interpret their\\nintentions now?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell threw up his hands in\\ndisgust. \\\"Next you'll say this is\\nan ancient Terran expedition\\nthat actually succeeded! There's\\nonly one way to answer the\\nquestions we've raised, and\\nthat's to go down and see for\\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n \\n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\\nat him when Farrell found\\nhimself alone in the helihopper\\nwith the forest flowing beneath\\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\\ninto the dusk ahead.\\n  \\n \\n  We never found a colony so\\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\\nthat really paid off? The\\nBees did some weird and wonderful\\nthings with human\\nguinea pigs\\u2014what if they've\\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\\nmyrmidons in our own\\nform?\\n  \\n \\n  Suppose, he thought\\u2014and derided\\nhimself for thinking it\\u2014one\\nof those suicidal old interstellar\\nventures\\n   \\n   did\\n   \\n  succeed?\\n  \\n \\n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\\ndrone from the helihopper's\\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\\nsharply into his musing. \\\"The\\nship has discovered the scouter\\nand is training an electronic\\nbeam upon it. My instruments\\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\\npattern of low power but\\nrapidly varying frequency. The\\noperation seems pointless.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\\nwith worry: \\\"I'd better\\npull Xav back. It may be something\\nlethal.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Don't,\\\" Gibson's baritone advised.\\nSurprisingly, there was\\nexcitement in the engineer's\\nvoice. \\\"I think they're trying to\\ncommunicate with us.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell was on the point of\\ndemanding acidly to know how\\none went about communicating\\nby means of a fluctuating electric\\nfield when the unexpected\\ncessation of forest diverted his\\nattention. The helihopper scudded\\nover a cultivated area\\nof considerable extent, fields\\nstretching below in a vague random\\ncheckerboard of lighter and\\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\\nof buildings at their center.\\nThere was a central bonfire that\\nburned like a wild red eye\\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\\nfigures.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"I'm passing over a hamlet,\\\"\\nFarrell reported. \\\"The one nearest\\nthe city, I think. There's\\nsomething odd going on\\ndown\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\\nthat he was caught completely\\nunprepared. The helihopper's\\nflimsy carriage bucked and\\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\\nflare of electric discharge, a\\npungent stink of ozone and a\\nstunning shock that flung him\\nheadlong into darkness.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\\nheadache and a conviction of\\nnightmare heightened by the\\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\\nof tables and lockers and chests.\\nThe lighting was harsh and\\noverbright and the air hung\\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\\nfar off yet at the same\\ntime as near as the bulkhead\\nabove him, came the unceasing\\ndrone of machinery.\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\\nwhen full consciousness made his\\nposition clear. He had been shot\\ndown by God knew what sort of\\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\\nand was a prisoner in the\\ngrounded ship.\\n  \\n \\n  At his rising, a white-smocked\\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\\nand close-cropped gray\\nhair came into the room, moving\\nwith the professional assurance\\nof a medic. The man stopped\\nshort at Farrell's stare and\\nspoke; his words were utterly\\nunintelligible, but his gesture\\nwas unmistakable.\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell followed him dumbly\\nout of the infirmary and down\\na bare corridor whose metal\\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\\nopen port near the corridor's end\\nrelieved the blankness of wall\\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\\nto look out, wondering how\\nlong he had lain unconscious,\\nand felt panic knife at him\\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\\nport open and undefended,\\non the square outside.\\n  \\n \\n  The mechanical had been as\\neasily taken as himself, then.\\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\\nprofessional caution, would fare\\nno better\\u2014they could not have\\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\\nand Xavier, and when they\\ntried as a matter of course to\\nrescue them the\\n   \\n   Marco\\n   \\n  would be\\nstruck down in turn by the same\\nweapon.\\n  \\n \\n  The fat medic turned and\\nsaid something urgent in his\\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\\ndazed by the enormity of what\\nhad happened, followed without\\nprotest into an intersecting way\\nthat led through a bewildering\\nsuccession of storage rooms and\\nhydroponics gardens, through a\\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\\nphysical training equipment in\\ngraduated sizes and finally into\\na soundproofed place that could\\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\\n  \\n \\n  The implication behind its\\npresence stopped Farrell short.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"A\\n   \\n   creche\\n   \\n  ,\\\" he said, stunned.\\nHe had a wild vision of endless\\ngenerations of children growing\\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\\nto be taught from their first\\ntoddling steps the functions they\\nmust fulfill before the venture\\nof which they were a part could\\nbe consummated.\\n  \\n \\n  One of those old ventures\\n   \\n   had\\n   \\n  succeeded, he thought, and was\\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\\nodyssey. The realization\\nleft him more alarmed than\\nbefore\\u2014for what technical marvels\\nmight not an isolated group\\nof such dogged specialists have\\ndeveloped during a millennium\\nof application?\\n  \\n \\n  Such a weapon as had brought\\ndown the helihopper and scouter\\nwas patently beyond reach of his\\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\\nhe thought, its possession\\nexplained the presence of these\\npeople here in the first stronghold\\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\\nthey had even fought and defeated\\nthe Bees on their own invaded\\nground.\\n  \\n \\n  He followed his white-smocked\\nguide through a power room\\nwhere great crude generators\\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\\nout gross electric current into\\narm-thick cables. They were\\nnearing the bow of the ship\\nwhen they passed by another\\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\\nout over the lowered rampway,\\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\\nand Gibson had been well\\ngrounded.\\n  \\n \\n  The\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  , ports open,\\nlay grounded outside.\\n  \\n \\n \\n  Farrell could not have said,\\nlater, whether his next move\\nwas planned or reflexive. The\\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\\nhang suspended for a breathless\\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\\ndecision, and in that instant he\\nmade his bid.\\n  \\n \\n  Without pausing in his stride\\nhe sprang out and through the\\nport and down the steep plane\\nof the ramp. The rough stone\\npavement of the square drummed\\nunderfoot; sore muscles\\ntore at him, and weakness was\\nlike a weight about his neck. He\\nexpected momentarily to be\\nblasted out of existence.\\n  \\n \\n  He reached the\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  with the startled shouts of his\\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\\nplunged inside and stabbed at\\ncontrols without waiting to seat\\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\\nThe ship darted up under his\\nmanipulation and arrowed into\\nspace with an acceleration that\\nsprung his knees and made his\\nvision swim blackly.\\n  \\n \\n  He was so weak with strain\\nand with the success of his coup\\nthat he all but fainted when\\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\\nstumbled out of his\\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\\nhim.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"What the hell are you doing,\\nArthur? Take us down!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker lumbered past him\\nand took the controls, spiraling\\nthe\\n   \\n   Marco Four\\n   \\n  down. Men\\nswarmed outside the ports when\\nthe Reclamations craft settled\\ngently to the square again. Gibson\\nand Xavier reached the ship\\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\\nleaving the mechanical outside\\nmaking patient explanations\\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\\n  \\n \\n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\\non Farrell's arm. \\\"It's all right,\\nArthur. There's no trouble.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell said dumbly, \\\"I don't\\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\\nyou and Xav down too?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"No one shot you down! These\\npeople are primitive enough to\\nuse metallic power lines to\\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\\nan anachronism you forgot\\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\\ninto one of those lines,\\nand the crash put you out for\\nthe rest of the night and most\\nof today. These Alphardians are\\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\\nbe found again that it's really\\npathetic.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"\\n   \\n   Friendly?\\n   \\n  That torpedo\\u2014\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\\\"\\nStryker put in. Understanding\\nof the error under which Farrell\\nhad labored erased his\\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\\ncommiseratingly. \\\"They had\\none small boat left for emergency\\nmissions, and sent it up to\\ncontact us in the fear that we\\nmight overlook their settlement\\nand move on. The boat was\\natomic powered, and our shield\\nscreens set off its engines.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\\nand his head ached dully.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"We cracked the communications\\nproblem early last night,\\\"\\nGibson said. \\\"These people use\\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\\nwave propagation called\\nfrequency modulation, and once\\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\\nold language; the natives reported\\nyour accident, and we came\\ndown at once.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"They really came from Terra?\\nThey lived through a thousand\\nyears of flight?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"The ship left Terra for\\nSirius in 2171,\\\" Gibson said.\\n\\\"But not with these people\\naboard, or their ancestors. That\\nexpedition perished after less\\nthan a light-year when its\\nhydroponics system failed. The\\nHymenops found the ship derelict\\nwhen they invaded us, and\\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\\nwhat was probably their first experiment\\nwith human subjects.\\nThe ship's log shows clearly\\nwhat happened to the original\\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\\nfrom the situation here.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell put his hands to his\\ntemples and groaned. \\\"The crash\\nmust have scrambled my wits.\\nGib, where\\n   \\n   did\\n   \\n  they come from?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"From one of the first peripheral\\ncolonies conquered by the\\nBees,\\\" Gibson said patiently.\\n\\\"The Hymenops were long-range\\nplanners, remember, and masters\\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\\nstocked the ship with a captive\\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\\nbelieve themselves descendants\\nof the original crew, and\\ngrounded it here in disabled\\ncondition. They left for Alphard\\nFive then, to watch developments.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Succeeding generations of\\ncolonists grew up accepting the\\nfact that their ship had missed\\nSirius and made planetfall here\\u2014they\\nstill don't know where\\nthey really are\\u2014by luck. They\\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\\nand they've struggled along\\nwith an inadequate technology in\\nthe hope that a later expedition\\nwould find them. They found the\\ntruth hard to take, but they're\\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\\nassimilation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Stryker, grinning, brought\\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\\ninvitingly. \\\"An unusually\\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\\nexperiment,\\\" he said. \\\"These\\npeople progressed normally because\\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\\nthem will be a simple\\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\\ncolonists within another generation.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But I don't see why the Bees\\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\\nthese people. Why did they\\nsit back and let them grow as\\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\\nmake sense!\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"But it does, for once,\\\" Gibson\\nsaid. \\\"The Bees set up this\\ncolony as a control unit to study\\nthe species they were invading,\\nand they had to give their\\nspecimens a normal\\u2014if obsolete\\u2014background\\nin order to determine\\ntheir capabilities. The fact\\nthat their experiment didn't tell\\nthem what they wanted to know\\nmay have had a direct bearing\\non their decision to pull out.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  Farrell shook his head. \\\"It's\\na reverse application, isn't it of\\nthe old saw about Terrans being\\nincapable of understanding an\\nalien culture?\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  \\\"Of course,\\\" said Gibson, surprised.\\n\\\"It's obvious enough,\\nsurely\\u2014hard as they tried, the\\nBees never understood us\\neither.\\\"\\n  \\n \\n  THE END\\n  \\n \\n  Transcriber's Note:\\n  \\n \\n This etext was produced from\\n  \\n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\\n  \\n January\\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.",

Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?'\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  'Not especially, sir,' he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  'You know what I mean, of course,' Kesserich pressed. 'The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.'\n  \n \n  'Heredity and environment,' Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. 'Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.'\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. 'To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.'\n  \n \n  'What about identical twins?' Kesserich pointed out. 'And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.' Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. 'There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.'\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. 'Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.'\n  \n \n  'Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?'\n  \n \n  'But environment would change things,' Jack objected. 'The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.'\n  \n \n  'Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....'\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  'Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,'\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n'Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.'\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  'Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,' the biologist\nexplained.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 73\nDocument 2 text: HAGERTY'S ENZYMES\n  \n \n  By A.

He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n  \n \n  'Just lie back, Harp,' droned his sister soothingly. 'Just give in and\nlet go of everything.'\n  \n \n  Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n  \n \n  For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n  \n \n  'Harp!' His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. 'Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?'\n  \n \n  Harper glared at the preposterous chair. 'Franz!' he snarled. 'That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!' Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  'Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.'\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n'Vacation!' he snorted. 'Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,\nreasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the\nidiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Hey, Harp, old man!' His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the\nnew colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.\n'Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk\ntwenty years ago?'\n  \n \n  Harper's hands twitched violently. 'Don't mention that fiasco!' he\nrasped. 'That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells\nspewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

'We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.'\n  \n \n  'And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,' Farrell said acidly, 'when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!'\n  \n \n  'But I saw them,' Stryker\nsaid. 'I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?'\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  'Gib's right,' he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . 'We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?'\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  'So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,'\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. 'Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.'\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  'Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.'\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n'What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?'\n  \n \n  'I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.'\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  'That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,' he said. 'And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.' Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. 'We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.'\n  \n \n  'They can't be Hymenops,'\nGibson said promptly. 'First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.'\n  \n \n  'There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,' Farrell pointed out.\n'Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.'\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.'\n  \n \n  'But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,' Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n'Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.'\n  \n \n  'The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,' Stryker\nsaid. 'Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.'\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  'We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.'\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  'If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,' he said,\n'then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?'\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, 'Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.'\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. 'If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?'\n  \n \n \n  'Aye, there's the rub,' Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. 'If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.'\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. 'We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?'\n  \n \n  'I'd like to go,' Gibson said\nat once. 'The ZIT computer can\nwait.'\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. 'No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.'\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  'You two did the field work\non the last location,' he said.\n'It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.'\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  'Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.'\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  'They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,' he\nsaid. 'Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?'\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. 'All\nright, Arthur?'\n  \n \n  'Good enough,' Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n'How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?'\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. 'The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  'At least they're human,'\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n'Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. 'Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.'\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. 'The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.'\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!'\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. 'Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.'\n  \n \n  'They're not alien,' Gibson\nsaid positively. 'Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Are thrust reaction jets,'\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. 'Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n'Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.'\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, 'If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?'\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Logic or not-logic,' Gibson\nsaid. 'If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,' Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, '\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  'If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,' Gibson\nfinished. 'Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.'\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  'The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?'\n  \n \n  'It couldn't have been built\nhere,' Stryker said. 'Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.'\n  \n \n  'We progress,' Farrell said\ndryly. 'Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.'\n  \n \n  'I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,' Gibson said calmly.\n'The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. 'I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.'\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.'\n  \n \n  'Then we can eliminate this\none now,' Farrell said flatly. 'It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.'\n  \n \n  'Arthur's right,' Stryker said\nreluctantly. 'An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014'\n  \n \n  'And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,'\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n'The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.'\n  \n \n  'But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,' Gibson said, 'and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. 'But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?'\n  \n \n  'We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,' Gibson reminded\nhim. 'We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?'\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. 'Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?'\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. 'The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.'\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: 'I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.'\n  \n \n  'Don't,' Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. 'I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.'\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  'I'm passing over a hamlet,'\nFarrell reported. 'The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014'\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  'A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,' he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  'What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!'\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. 'It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.'\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, 'I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?'\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  'No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014'\n  \n \n  'It wasn't a torpedo at all,'\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. 'They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.'\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  'We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,'\nGibson said. 'These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.'\n  \n \n  'They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?'\n  \n \n  'The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,' Gibson said.\n'But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.'\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. 'The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?'\n  \n \n  'From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,' Gibson said patiently.\n'The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  'Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.'\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. 'An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,' he said. 'These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  'But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!'\n  \n \n  'But it does, for once,' Gibson\nsaid. 'The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. 'It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?'\n  \n \n  'Of course,' said Gibson, surprised.\n'It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.'\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

In the silence he reached up with quick\nfingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the\nhalves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off\nof his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been\ninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n  \n \n  He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. 'That's how I did it,\nEarthman.'\n  \n \n  'Glassite!' said Rice. 'A face-moulded mask of glassite!'\n  \n \n  Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. 'Very marvelously pared to\nan unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the\nhead. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed\nas you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible\nat all.'\n  \n \n  Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and\nthe Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and\nquick.\n  \n \n  Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. 'First time in years a man ever came\naboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.'\n  \n \n  Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. 'I thought it might be. Where's\nyour radio?'\n  \n \n  'Go find it!' snapped Rice, hotly.\n  \n \n  'I will.' One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.\n'I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock\nis safe. Don't move.' Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the\nladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and\ncoils. The radio.\n  \n \n  Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his\nfeet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by\nthe new bitterness in it.\n  \n \n  Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n  \n \n  He smiled. 'That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014'\n  \n \n  Rice said it, slow:\n  \n \n  'Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead\nmen belong here.'\n  \n \n  Lethla's gun grip tightened. 'More talk of that nature, and only dead\nmen there will be.' He blinked. 'But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....'\n  \n \n  'Kriere!' Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n  \n \n  Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes\nlidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.\nLethla's voice came next:\n  \n \n  'Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus\nat an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these\nair-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked\nunexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the\nlife-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing\ntheir lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the\nEarth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n  \n \n  'We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.\nWe were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture\nwas certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a\nsmall time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our\nchrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to\ntrick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too\nlate and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for\nbrief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.'\n  \n \n  Rice's voice was sullen. 'A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the\nprotection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe\nto Venus.'\n  \n \n  Lethla bowed slightly. 'Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing\nsafe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?'\n  \n \n  'Precious is the word for you, brother!' said Rice.\n  \n \n  'Enough!' Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n  \n \n  'Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be\npicked up\u2014\n   \n   now!\n   \n  '\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

And\nit is true that now we must let most of that life be destroyed.

'Honestly.

Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  'I think you are wonderful,' she laughed. 'You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.' She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. 'I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.'\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, 'Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.'\n  \n \n  She shrugged. 'Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.",

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist.

He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

In the silence he reached up with quick\nfingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the\nhalves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off\nof his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been\ninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n  \n \n  He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,\nEarthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n  \n \n  Lethla nodded.

After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture?

He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool.

And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter.

In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n\ndocument 2: The\n  cool green disk of Alphard\nSix on the screen was\ninfinitely welcome after the arid\ndesolation and stinking swamplands\nof the inner planets, an\nairy jewel of a world that might\nhave been designed specifically\nfor the hard-earned month of\nrest ahead. Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.",

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly.

Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock?

Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one.

But suppose you did try.

How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool.

And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.
