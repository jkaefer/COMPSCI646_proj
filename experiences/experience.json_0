                "Christianity is a central component of the story. The heart of the narrative revolves around the description of the world as a replica of the biblical Garden of Eden. The author goes into extensive detail regarding the aspects of the garden and its inhabitants and how they conform to aspects of the Genesis narrative and how it was understood by religious analysis. It is heavily suggested that here, the Serpent did not succeed in convincing man to sin and fall from grace as was the case in the biblical narrative. As a result, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah (the Hebrew names for Adam and Eve) remain clothed in light and still enjoy the preternatural gifts of creation including a highly advanced intellect, immortality and even an illuminated appearance.\n\nIt is revealed that this depiction is a deception on the part of the moon\u2019s inhabitants. Interestingly, the 4 non-believers on the crew are the most ready to believe that the state of affairs on the planet is indeed supernatural. It is only the clever priest who possesses faith, but employs the skepticism necessary to see through the fraud.\n",
                "Snake-Oil Sam, the mastermind behind the ruse, realizes that the visitors who come to the new world will immediately make connections to the Garden of Eden if there are enough clues to point them in that direction. In that way, the story demonstrates that people are susceptible to believing in an already established story or trope, regardless of how impossible it seems. Since the settlers are familiar with the Bible and the famous story of Adam and Eve, they are preconditioned to believe that another Adam and Eve may exist in a separate world, a world that has yet to be tainted with sin. \n\nThe priest is the only character that sees through Adam and Eve\u2019s show. Although it\u2019s strange that the religious man in the group would be the most skeptical, it\u2019s clear that he has a keen eye for details. He purposefully asks Adam to play checkers with him to test his supernatural intellect, and when Adam refuses, he realizes that he cannot be who he says he is. Perhaps the priest has the most to lose in believing in this illusion, so his refusal to take the con artists at their word shows his true dedication to Christianity. \n",
                "The people on the surface of the moon that the crew of the Little Probe is investigating are part of a very detailed ploy to replicate the biblical story of Adam and Eve. This religious story served as a recognizable type of paradise, which the serpent used to his advantage, knowing that humans would be drawn to something that they thought was perfect. All of the details of the facade were carefully designed around an attempt to make an authentic, tempting environment. This included changing some details from the English-translated version of the biblical story, including giving the people their Hebrew names of Ha Adamah and Hawwah. The other major point of religion in the story is the Jesuit priest who is onboard the Little Probe. It is Father Briton who is the skeptic, asking questions during his stay on the surface to try to uncover the truth of the situation. The rest of the crew are surprised that it is the religious man who is skeptical of the reality of the moon, but he convinces them that he is right, having thought carefully about every detail of every interaction they had on the surface.",
                "\tThe story of Adam and Eve (or Genesis) is one of the most widely known myths. The idea that we, as humans, once inhabited Paradise, but lost it due to our greed and stolen innocence is intoxicating. It explains why life isn\u2019t perfect, why things don\u2019t always go our way, and why people die. \n\tIn In the Garden, this story is explored in a different manner. The Christian origin story acts as a backdrop for this uninhabited planet that a crew visits. After exploring, they are quick to believe that they have discovered another universe\u2019s Eden. And, therefore, quick to destroy it. \n\tTheir religious faith and belief in the story of Adam and Eve adds to the gravity of the situation. If this weren\u2019t a well-known story, then the crew would have been less amazed by the space before them. The perfection of the place, and the potential of Paradise, was what truly brought them in and, eventually, destroyed them.\n"

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.",

The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.",

All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n  \n \n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.",

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  'Welcome,' the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  'Thank you,' Steffens said. 'We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.'\n  \n \n  'Our desire,' the robot repeated mechanically, 'is only to serve.'\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  'Will the others come down?' asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  'They must remain with the ship,' Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  'We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.'\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  'We perceive,' the robot went on, 'that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.'\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 190\nDocument 2 text: 'What do you\n   \n   do\n   \n  ?' Steffens asked.\n  \n \n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: 'We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.'\n  \n \n  'When they return?' It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. 'I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.'\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  'It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?'\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  'God?' the robot repeated without comprehension. 'What is God?'\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  'It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014' Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014'but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014' Elb caught\nhimself\u2014'you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014' Elb paused for a long while\u2014'an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.'\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  'Sunset,' said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. 'I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....' She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  'I cannot rise,' he whispered faintly. 'I cannot.'\n  \n \n  'Dark!' The mother croaked, the girl came running. 'Here,' and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. 'Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.' She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  'Go now,' said the mother. 'Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.'\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  'Why...?'\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. 'The child spoke!'\n  \n \n  'Aye,' said his father. 'Did you hear what he said?'\n  \n \n  'I heard,' said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  'War!'\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. 'Why, Dark, why?'\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, 'This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!'\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. 'Get on!' she cried.\n'What's your name, bad one?'\n  \n \n  'Chion!' laughed the boy. 'Chion, Chion, Chion!'\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  'Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!'\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. 'Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.'\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. 'You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.'\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  'Your name?' he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  'Lyte!' she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  'I'm Sim,' he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  'Sim!' she repeated it, flashing on. 'I'll remember!'\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. 'Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,' she said to the distracted boy.\n'Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.'\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. 'Lyte!' he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. 'Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!'\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. 'I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!'\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 277\nDocument 2 text: Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.\n  \n \n  It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a\nreputation for demanding results at any cost\u2014even at the cost of\ndestroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.\n  \n \n  Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot\nbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy\nthat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward\ncommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting\nphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But\nHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough\ngetting him here.\n  \n \n  Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of\nhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he\ntook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not\nentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his\nbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which\nHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the\neating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture\nof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for\nanother day.\n  \n \n  He returned quickly to the room.\n  \n \n  His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers\nreported\u2014nothing new\u2014and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the\ncouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his\nstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but\ndecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other\nhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was\nnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat\nof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical\nbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in\nages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and\nhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it\u2014with\nits population\u2014as a decoy, had they arrived at all.\n  \n \n  Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near\nthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they\nhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of\nfleeing again.\n  \n \n  But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their\nexistence to their enemies\u2014\n  \n \n  'Hatcher!'\n  \n \n  The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his\nsecond in command, very excited. 'What is it?' Hatcher demanded.\n  \n \n  'Wait....'\n  \n \n  Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something\nwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to\nhim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted\nthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into\nhis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had\njust taken.... 'Now!' cried the assistant. 'Look!'\n  \n \n  At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image\nwas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a\ncathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to\nshow.\n  \n \n  Hatcher was startled. 'Another one! And\u2014is it a different species? Or\nmerely a different sex?'\n  \n \n  'Study the probe for yourself,' the assistant invited.\n  \n \n  Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n'No matter,' he said at last. 'Bring the other one in.'\n  \n \n  And then, in a completely different mood, 'We may need him badly. We\nmay be in the process of killing our first one now.'\n  \n \n  'Killing him, Hatcher?'\n  \n \n  Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like\npuppies dislodged from suck. 'Council's orders,' he said. 'We've got to\ngo into Stage Two of the project at once.'\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,\nhe had an inspiration.\n  \n \n  The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been\nand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to\nhave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed\nit.\n  \n \n  Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything\u2014even\nhimself.\n  \n \n  'God bless,' he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that\npinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now\nthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects\non some strange property of the light.\n  \n \n  At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n  \n \n  He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n  \n \n  For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and\nalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was\ngone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had\nhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,\nperhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very\nfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n  \n \n  McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no\nchange.\n  \n \n  And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n  \n \n  He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell\none. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger\nnow. He stood there, perplexed.\n  \n \n  A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,\namazement in its tone, 'McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you\ncalling from?'\n  \n \n  He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. 'This\nis Herrell McCray,' he cried. 'I'm in a room of some sort, apparently\non a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know\u2014'\n  \n \n  'McCray!' cried the tiny voice in his ear. 'Where are you? This is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  calling. Answer, please!'\n  \n \n  'I\n   \n   am\n   \n  answering, damn it,' he roared. 'What took you so long?'\n  \n \n  'Herrell McCray,' droned the tiny voice in his ear, 'Herrell McCray,\nHerrell McCray, this is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  responding to your message,\nacknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....'\n  \n \n  It kept on, and on.\n  \n \n  McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they\ndidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or\u2014no.\nThat was not it; they\n   \n   had\n   \n  heard him, because they were responding.\nBut it seemed to take them so long....\n  \n \n  Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his\nmind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was\nit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n  \n \n  Did that mean\u2014did it\n   \n   possibly\n   \n  mean\u2014that there was a lag of an hour\nor two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his\nsuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took\n   \n   hours\n   \n  to get a message to the ship and back?\n  \n \n  And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  'Welcome,' the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  'Thank you,' Steffens said. 'We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.'\n  \n \n  'Our desire,' the robot repeated mechanically, 'is only to serve.'\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  'Will the others come down?' asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  'They must remain with the ship,' Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  'We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.'\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  'We perceive,' the robot went on, 'that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.'\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 734\nDocument 2 text: 'Men are too perishable,' Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. 'For all\npractical purposes I'm never going to marry again. All my husbands die.'\n  \n \n  'Would you pass the beets, please?' Humphrey Fownes said.\n  \n \n  She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. 'And don't look at me\nthat way,' she said. 'I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  going to marry you and if you want\nreasons I'll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.'\n  \n \n  The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything\npassionately\u2014talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately\nred. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry\ntinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had\nnever known anyone like her. 'You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,'\nshe said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for\nher to be, to explain why she couldn't marry him. 'Do you have any\nidea what people are saying? They're all saying I'm a cannibal! I rob\nmy husbands of their life force and when they're empty I carry their\nbodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.'\n  \n \n  'As long as there are people,' he said philosophically, 'there'll be\ntalk.'\n  \n \n  'But it's the air! Why don't they talk about that? The air is stale,\nI'm positive. It's not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt,\nNorman and Alphonse couldn't stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so\nhealthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily\nworse for him.'\n  \n \n  'I don't seem to mind the air.'\n  \n \n  She threw up her hands. 'You'd be the worst of the lot!' She left the\ntable, rustling and tinkling about the room. 'I can just hear them. Try\nsome of the asparagus.\n   \n   Five.\n   \n  That's what they'd say. That woman did\nit again. And the plain fact is I don't want you on my record.'\n  \n \n  'Really,' Fownes protested. 'I feel splendid. Never better.'\n  \n \n  He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his\nshoulders. 'And what about those\n   \n   very\n   \n  elaborate plans you've been\nmaking to seduce me?'\n  \n \n  Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\n  \n \n  'Don't you think\n   \n   they'll\n   \n  find out?\n   \n   I\n   \n  found out and you can bet\n   \n   they\n   \n  will.

All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  'We should have delivered our message by radio,' he said, 'and gone\nback into space.'\n  \n \n  'You could probably still go,' she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. 'I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.'\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. 'We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.'\n  \n \n  He turned from her. 'It's all dead. What would be the use?'\n  \n \n  'I came from the Earth,' she said quietly. 'And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.'\n  \n \n  'But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.' Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. 'We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.'\n  \n \n  'Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.'\n  \n \n  'What're you talking about?'\n  \n \n  'They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.'\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  'They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.'\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  'These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.'\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. 'So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?'\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. 'Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.' A pause. 'And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?'\n  \n \n  'Michael.' Her voice trembled. 'I\u2014I don't know how to say this.'\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  'I'm\u2014going to have a child.'\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  'No,' he said thickly. 'I can't believe it.'\n  \n \n  'It's true.'\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  'Yes, I can see it is.'\n  \n \n  'I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.'\n  \n \n  He shook his head. 'I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.'\n  \n \n  'Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.' She\npaused, frowning. 'I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.'\n  \n \n  'Such a thing,' he said, smiling grimly, 'hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.' He paused. 'After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.'\n  \n \n  'No,' she said quietly. 'I don't think they could.'\n  \n \n  'And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .' He took her in his arms. 'If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.' A pause. 'Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.'\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 174\nDocument 2 text: Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  'Have a seat, Major,' he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  'Sir?' the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  'We're out of cigarettes, Joe,' the Captain said. 'Will you get us\nsome, please?'\n  \n \n  'Sure thing,' the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  'They steal them,' Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  'Steal what?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.'\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  'All right,' I said, 'suppose we start at the beginning.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. 'Sir?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  'I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Is there a local hero named Joe?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'No, no, nothing like that,' he assured me. 'It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.'\n  \n \n  'I can see that,' I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  'And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.'\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  'It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,'\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  'Get to the point, Captain!' I barked.\n  \n \n  'Easy, sir,' Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. 'The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?'\n  \n \n  'I follow, all right,' I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  'Well,' Bransten went on, 'that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.'\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  'Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.'\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  'I understand perfectly,' I snapped. 'Where are my quarters?'\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  'What is it, Major?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'This man Joe,' I said. 'Can you give me any more on him?'\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. 'Why, Major,' he said, 'you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?'\n  \n \n  'None at all,' I snapped back. 'I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....'\n  \n \n  'Take your time, Major,' Walsh beamed. 'There's no rush at all.'\n  \n \n  'I thought....'\n  \n \n  'I'm sure you can do the job,' Walsh cut in. 'I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.'\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. 'Look....'\n  \n \n  'He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,' Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Polk!' he shouted, 'can you hear me?'\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  'Joe?' I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  'Who else, boss?' he answered.\n  \n \n  'I'm trying to locate someone,' I said. 'I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?'\n  \n \n  'It'll cost you, boss,' the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  'How much?'\n  \n \n  'Two cartons of cigarettes at least.'\n  \n \n  'Who's the guide?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'How's the price sound?'\n  \n \n  'Fine, fine,' I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  'His name is Joe,' the Venusian told me. 'Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....'\n  \n \n  'Skip it,' I said, cutting the promotion short. 'Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.'\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  'And Joe,' I said, stopping him at the door, 'I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.'\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. 'No danger of that, boss,' he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.",

Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.",

Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched.

It cannot\nbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy\nthat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward\ncommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting\nphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But\nHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough\ngetting him here.\n  \n \n  Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of\nhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he\ntook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not\nentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his\nbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which\nHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the\neating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture\nof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for\nanother day.\n  \n \n  He returned quickly to the room.\n  \n \n  His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers\nreported\u2014nothing new\u2014and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the\ncouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his\nstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but\ndecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other\nhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was\nnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat\nof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical\nbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in\nages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and\nhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it\u2014with\nits population\u2014as a decoy, had they arrived at all.\n  \n \n  Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near\nthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they\nhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of\nfleeing again.\n  \n \n  But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their\nexistence to their enemies\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Hatcher!\"\n  \n \n  The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his\nsecond in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Wait....\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something\nwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to\nhim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted\nthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into\nhis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had\njust taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image\nwas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a\ncathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to\nshow.\n  \n \n  Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And\u2014is it a different species? Or\nmerely a different sex?\"\n  \n \n  \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited.\n  \n \n  Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n\"No matter,\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\"\n  \n \n  And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We\nmay be in the process of killing our first one now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Killing him, Hatcher?\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like\npuppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to\ngo into Stage Two of the project at once.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,\nhe had an inspiration.\n  \n \n  The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been\nand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to\nhave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed\nit.\n  \n \n  Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything\u2014even\nhimself.\n  \n \n  \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that\npinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now\nthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects\non some strange property of the light.\n  \n \n  At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n  \n \n  He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n  \n \n  For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and\nalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was\ngone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had\nhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,\nperhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very\nfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n  \n \n  McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no\nchange.\n  \n \n  And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n  \n \n  He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell\none. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger\nnow. He stood there, perplexed.\n  \n \n  A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,\namazement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you\ncalling from?\"\n  \n \n  He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. \"This\nis Herrell McCray,\" he cried. \"I'm in a room of some sort, apparently\non a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  calling. Answer, please!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   am\n   \n  answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\"\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell McCray,\nHerrell McCray, this is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  responding to your message,\nacknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\"\n  \n \n  It kept on, and on.\n  \n \n  McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they\ndidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or\u2014no.\nThat was not it; they\n   \n   had\n   \n  heard him, because they were responding.\nBut it seemed to take them so long....\n  \n \n  Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his\nmind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was\nit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n  \n \n  Did that mean\u2014did it\n   \n   possibly\n   \n  mean\u2014that there was a lag of an hour\nor two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his\nsuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took\n   \n   hours\n   \n  to get a message to the ship and back?\n  \n \n  And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?",

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.",

And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.",

He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.",

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.",

He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.",

All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n  \n \n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.",

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n\ndocument 2: AIDE MEMOIRE\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  The Fustians looked like turtles\u2014but\n   \n  they could move fast when they chose!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Across the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet\nof parchment and looked grave.\n  \n \n  \"This aide memoire,\" he said, \"was just handed to me by the Cultural\nAttache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the\nmatter of sponsorship of Youth groups\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Some youths,\" Retief said. \"Average age, seventy-five.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Fustians are a long-lived people,\" Magnan snapped. \"These matters\nare relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. He'll try anything\u2014in the hope it will maim somebody.\"\n  \n \n  \"Precisely the problem,\" Magnan said. \"But the Youth Movement is\nthe important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And\nsponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the\nTerrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the\nmission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement\nrelations with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future.\nYou, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their\nrumbles,\" Retief said. \"Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control\ngroup\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,\" Magnan cut in. \"This\ngroup\u2014\" he glanced at the paper\u2014\"known as the Sexual, Cultural, and\nAthletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting\nsponsorship for a matter of weeks now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment\nand anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and\nathletic development,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"If we don't act promptly,\" Magnan said, \"the Groaci Embassy may well\nanticipate us. They're very active here.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward. However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n  \n \n  \"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\n\ndocument 3: He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n  \n \n  His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n  \n \n  \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So many? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n  \n \n  \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n\ndocument 4: All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n\ndocument 5: In their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n  \n \n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n\n# plan: Based on the gathered information, provide a comprehensive response that covers the key characteristics, life cycle stages, social dynamics, and cultural practices of the peculiar beings.

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.",

The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.",

We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes.

He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say.

It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.",

                        "Fustians somewhat resemble gigantic, intelligent snapping turtles, and like turtles, start life as eggs. During their youth and adolescence, they are relatively agile and have no shells (unlike turtles). It is notable how many Fustian elders take a dim view of adolescents, with the Minister of Fust himself saying that the Youth should be \u201ckept penned with the livestock until they grow a carapace to tame their irresponsibility.\u201d\nWhen Fustians mature, they develop an enormous, horny carapace which they are obliged to carry around on their backs for the rest of their lives, which last over a thousand years. The carapaces cause the adult Fustians to be slow-moving, and they take up a lot of space \u2013 hence their public transportation consists of flat-cars instead of buses with seats. Unfortunately, not much is known by off-worlders of Fustian females.\nLike most intelligent races, Fustians enjoy music. The frequencies at which their music is played are subsonic, and therefore not audible to the human ear. Likewise, their ears are quite sensitive to high frequencies, such as those produced by tapping on a crystal glass with a spoon. This is not just unpleasant, but painful to Fustian ears.\n",
                        "Fustians are similar to tortoises in build, with yellow eyes, scales, and very thick hides that leak purple blood when cut. They have a much longer life-cycle than humans, as those that are 75 years of age are still considered to be teenagers or even youths. \n\nAs Faustians age, they grow larger, their voices get deeper, and they eventually acquire very heavy shells. It is past their current medical knowledge to safely remove the shells, though we find out at the end of the story that the Groaci have discovered a technique that allows them to do this. This is important because the shells slow the older Fustians down and are often considered a nuisance. When they are young, they are very secretive, and wary of strangers from other groups and species. The older Fustians do not seem to mind the humans (and aliens in general) as much, and sometimes apologize for the behavior of the younger ones. It seems that they wish they could do more to control their behavior, but the younger ones are physically much faster and can escape attempts at control. It also seems to be the case that this difference in behavior is more acute now than it has been in the past, perhaps due to social pressures from other groups. \n\nSleep is very important to them, and regular greetings in day-to-day life include well wishes for a long rest, as well as specific types of dreams. When they are angry or want to insult someone, they wish nightmares upon them. They have regular siesta times during the work day. Sleep is so important to them that they have a National Dirge called the Lament of Hatching. Ceremonial revenge is also important to them: although the older Fustians are not necessarily quick to anger, they follow through once they have been wronged. ",
                        "Fustians are a species turtle-like in their appearance. They have very long lives; in fact, the average age of a Fustian youth is seventy-five years old. As they age, they develop a hard-shell on their backs, which is quite heavy and hard. This causes them to move slower as they get older. The younger Fustians can move quite fast in comparison. However, the older Fustians appear to be a great deal stronger and can hold their own in combat, as demonstrated by Whonk when he defends himself against Slock\u2019s cronies and eventually captures Slock. The elderly Fustians also grow thicker skin, which is what ultimately prevents Whonk from being decapitated when he is first attacked. Fustians have turtle-like mouths that snap when they are angry. Steel manufacturing fuels their economy. While older Fustians are generally hospitable and patient, the younger Fustians have become frustrated with the ways of the elderly Fustian leadership, and their drive to change things blinds them to being manipulated by the Groaci. Although weapons are illegal on Fust, the younger Fustians seem willing to break this rule by accepting weapons from the Groaci in exchange for their knowledge of the ships.",
                        "The Fustians look like turtles and have extremely long lifespans. Younger Fustians do not have a carapace, but older ones do, which can be quite heavy. Seventy-five-year-olds are considered youths, like teenagers, because they can live for about two thousand years. The 75-year-olds have a reputation as being at a trying age. As Whonk explains to Retief, the youth have a reputation for \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cdiscourtesy.\u201d The Elders feel that there is little they can do about the youths' misbehavior since the Elders are so much slower with their carapaces. They have no police and have never needed them until the youth became so unruly. They have a youth group, the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS), that needs a sponsor and wants someone to provide them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and so forth. The Fustians\u2019 dwellings have a fishy odor and are found along a broad cobbled street. They have a caste system; the driver of a flat car is a member of the labor caste. Their greetings relate to peaceful sleep: \u201cLong-may-you-sleep\u201d and \u201cMay-you-dream-of-the-deeps.\u201d Likewise, their insults related to unpleasant sleep: \u201cMay you toss in nightmares!\u201d The oldest Fustians are forced into retirement and given once-daily feedings; Whonk says this is nothing to look forward to for his next thousand years. They have a strong sense of right and wrong and carry out ceremonial revenge when wronged."

Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest.

She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals.

Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.",

We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes.

He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say.

It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it.

No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.",

When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n  \n \n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n  \n \n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"A long time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n  \n \n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.",

The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody?

I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.",

Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. 'Suit yourself.' The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. 'I believe you,'\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. 'Thank God.'\n  \n \n  'So you got away.' The Commissioner shook his head. 'You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.'\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. 'I have a\ntheory,' he murmured.\n  \n \n  'What is it?'\n  \n \n  'About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.'\n  \n \n  'A long time?'\n  \n \n  'Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.'\n  \n \n  'Why do you say that?'\n  \n \n  'When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014'\n  \n \n  'So?'\n  \n \n  'They were all represented by figures.' Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. 'Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.'\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. 'An old struggle.'\n  \n \n  'They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.'\n  \n \n  'Why defeated?'\n  \n \n  'They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.' He clenched his fists. 'I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.'\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. 'Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.' He\nturned from the window. 'Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.'\n  \n \n  'Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?'\n  \n \n  'That would seem simple.' The Commissioner smiled faintly. '\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. 'Bait? What do you mean?'\n  \n \n  'To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.'\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. 'Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014' He broke off. 'They were ready with a trap.'\n  \n \n  'And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.' The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. 'Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.'\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. 'And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014'\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n'Maybe,' he said softly, 'you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.' He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort.

'There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?' His voice rose excitedly. 'What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!'\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. 'Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.'\n  \n \n  'A reason! What kind of a reason?'\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. 'Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?'\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them.

What's the matter?' Potter glanced at his watch. 'Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.'\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  'I'm going nuts,' Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  'For Heaven's sake,' Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk.

'You look\nsick.'\n  \n \n  'The body. There in the park.'\n  \n \n  'Sure, Ed.' Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. 'Take it easy.'\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. 'Something\nwrong?'\n  \n \n  'Ed's not feeling well.'\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. 'How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014'\n  \n \n  'What's he talking about?' Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  'The body!' Ed shouted. 'The body hanging there!'\n  \n \n  More people collected. 'Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?'\n  \n \n  'The body!' Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. 'Let me go! The police! Get the police!'\n  \n \n  'Ed\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Better get a doctor!'\n  \n \n  'He must be sick.'\n  \n \n  'Or drunk.'\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  'Do something!' he screamed. 'Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!'\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness.

Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing.

'Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.'\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. 'An old struggle.'\n  \n \n  'They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.'\n  \n \n  'Why defeated?'\n  \n \n  'They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.' He clenched his fists. 'I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.'\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. 'Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.' He\nturned from the window. 'Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.'\n  \n \n  'Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?'\n  \n \n  'That would seem simple.' The Commissioner smiled faintly. '\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. 'Bait? What do you mean?'\n  \n \n  'To draw you out. Make you declare yourself.

'They were ready with a trap.'\n  \n \n  'And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.' The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. 'Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.'\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. 'And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014'\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n'Maybe,' he said softly, 'you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.' He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort.

The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.",

I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.",

A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually.

Like everybody else?\"\n  \n \n  After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed\nthe explanation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it's official?

I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.",

Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.",

The body\u2014it's\n   \n   supposed\n   \n  to be hanging there?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"\n  \n \n  Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n\ndocument 2: They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n  \n \n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n  \n \n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"A long time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n  \n \n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.\n\ndocument 3: \"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n\n# plan: Based on the information gathered, provide a concise response that includes Edward C.

He is terrified by death and instantly starts looking for something that could explain a dead body hanging from a lamppost. He\u2019s also quite shrewd and good at pretending. We see that, when he manages to deceive two cops and escape after he realizes that they are not real police officers. He also shows his intellect when sharing his assumption regarding the creatures and referencing the biblical image.

He took a deep shuddering breath.\n  \n \n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me.

Like everybody else?\"\n  \n \n  After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed\nthe explanation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it's official?

The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.",

He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.",

Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.",

When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n  \n \n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n  \n \n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"A long time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n  \n \n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort.

I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.",

There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

                        "text": "Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\nsatisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\n  \n \n  MOON SHIP DESTROYED\n   \n  IN TRANSIT\n   \n  NO COMMUNICATION FROM\n   \n  ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\n   \n  STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\n   \n  PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\n   \n  WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n  \n \n  The item below the last one said:\n  \n \n  Pacifica, June 7\u2014The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\nin fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   \n   superior to ourselves in every way\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly.",

But his\n   \n  luck had run its course, and now he was\n   \n  marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save\n   \n  himself from a menace weapons could not kill.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"\n   \n   And so, my dear\n   \n  ,\" Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase, \"\n   \n   I'm\nafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014or\nis it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,\nyou'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.",

His eyes rolled as he added, 'A lady!'\n  \n \n  A woman here...! The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. 'Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.'\n  \n \n  'Hi, Billy-boy,' she greeted calmly. 'Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.'\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. 'Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....'\n  \n \n  'Okay, okay,' I grinned. 'Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.'\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  'What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?'\n  \n \n  'Hold it, Billy-boy.' Laughingly she threw up both hands. 'Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.'\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  'What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?' I asked. 'That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 348\nDocument 2 text: For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  'My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,'\nshe began. 'When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....'\n  \n \n  'Who?' I interrupted.\n  \n \n  'An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.'\n  \n \n  The old woman paused. 'Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?' she\nasked abruptly.\n  \n \n  I shook my head. 'Some new kind of ...'\n  \n \n  'It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  'When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.'\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  'Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  'The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.'\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  'To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!'\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, 'So what?'\n  \n \n  'So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  'Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.'\n  \n \n  'I see,' I said as she lapsed into silence. 'And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.'\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. 'Yes,' she said. 'That's exactly what I think.'\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. 'The same old Flowers,' I said. 'Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?'\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. 'What makes you say that?'\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  'The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.'\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. 'No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  'And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  'Let's get out of here,' I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  'All right!'\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n  \n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

At a festival like this\nsomebody with a strange accent, or\nwho didn't know exactly how to wear\nhis clothes correctly, or was off the\nordinary in any of a dozen other\nways, wouldn't be noticed.

What better opportunity\nto study a people than when they\nare in their cups? If\n   \n   you\n   \n  could go\nback a few thousand years, the things\nyou would wish to see would be a\nRoman Triumph, perhaps the Rites\nof Dionysus, or one of Alexander's\norgies.

'No ma'am,\nyou'd have to stick to some great\nevent, both for the sake of actual\ninterest and for protection against being\nunmasked.'\n  \n \n  The old boy wound it up. 'Well,\nthat's the story.

You can\ntake the plane to Munich, spend a\nweek there and\u2014'\n  \n \n  Simon was shaking his head. 'Not\ninterested.'\n  \n \n  As soon as Betty had got her jaw\nback into place, she glared unbelievingly\nat him.\n  \n \n  Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\n'See here, young man, I realize\nthis isn't an ordinary assignment,\nhowever, as I said, I am willing to\nrisk a considerable portion of my\nfortune\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Sorry,' Simon said. 'Can't be\ndone.'\n  \n \n  'A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,'\nMr. Oyster said quietly. 'I\nlike the fact that you already seem\nto have some interest and knowledge\nof the matter.

Betty wailed.\n  \n \n  'Just for laughs,' Simon told the\ntwo of them sourly, 'suppose I tell\nyou a funny story.

Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\nanyway, this was a natural. On\nthe way to Idlewild I stopped off at\nthe Germany Information Offices for\nsome tourist literature.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly three and a half\nhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the\nfun I was going to have.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly seven and a half\nhours from Gander to Shannon and\nI spent that time dreaming up material\nI could put into my reports to\nMr. Oyster. I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n  \n \n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind. These statistics I read on\nthe\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people\nattended annually.\n  \n \n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway.

His eyes rolled as he added, 'A lady!'\n  \n \n  A woman here...! The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. 'Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.'\n  \n \n  'Hi, Billy-boy,' she greeted calmly. 'Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.'\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. 'Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....'\n  \n \n  'Okay, okay,' I grinned. 'Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.'\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  'What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?'\n  \n \n  'Hold it, Billy-boy.' Laughingly she threw up both hands. 'Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.'\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  'What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?' I asked. 'That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 348\nDocument 2 text: For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  'My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,'\nshe began. 'When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....'\n  \n \n  'Who?' I interrupted.\n  \n \n  'An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.'\n  \n \n  The old woman paused. 'Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?' she\nasked abruptly.\n  \n \n  I shook my head. 'Some new kind of ...'\n  \n \n  'It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  'When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.'\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  'Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  'The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.'\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  'To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!'\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, 'So what?'\n  \n \n  'So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  'Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.'\n  \n \n  'I see,' I said as she lapsed into silence. 'And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.'\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. 'Yes,' she said. 'That's exactly what I think.'\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. 'The same old Flowers,' I said. 'Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?'\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. 'What makes you say that?'\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  'The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.'\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. 'No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  'And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  'Let's get out of here,' I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  'All right!'\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n  \n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  'Lord!' he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud.

For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area.

HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. 'Shall we, gentlemen?' and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  'Hey, Martin!' Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n'Wind,' Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. 'That's all we need, isn't it?'\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. 'Worried?'\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. 'Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?'\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, 'Let us hope they aren't immortal.'\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n'It's here, too.'\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. 'Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.'\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, 'Here, too. How far do you think it goes?'\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. 'Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.'\n  \n \n  'Defense,' Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  'Could be,' Martin said. 'Let's go in.'\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. 'Not\u2014not very big. Is it?'\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. 'Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?'\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014'Maybe they crawled.'\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. 'All right!' he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  'Sorry,' Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014'I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?'\n  \n \n  'I imagine they had illumination of some sort,' Martin answered, dryly.\n'If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.'\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, 'I mean outside.'\n  \n \n  'Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.' Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  'Well,' Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, 'now that we're here....'\n  \n \n  'Pictures,' Martin decided. 'We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?'\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. 'I left the camera in the lifeboat.'\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014'It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.'\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. 'Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.'\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. 'What's the matter?'\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. 'I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014'\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. 'You didn't,' he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. 'You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!'\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. 'The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.'\n  \n \n  '... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.'\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. 'That\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Martin!' Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n'Martin, I can't get out!'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

There isn\u2019t\nanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters\nnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\nloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s\npart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\nwedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe\nshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.\nEveryone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no\nexception.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming\nin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\nfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have\nproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t\nsolve.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one\nsingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll\nbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\nall those mysteries. I met you when the whole\nvalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\nby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\nnot me. He was the hero without even meaning to\nbe. He was the one who rode through town and\nwarned people that the flood was coming. I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,\nyou'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 242\nDocument 2 text: 'No!'

He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\n   \n   He was standing up!\n   \n \n \n  The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n'clock' was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\n  \n \n  To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n  \n \n  'You devil!' Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n'I said you were a god.

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available.

Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville.

His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\n  \n \n  MOON SHIP DESTROYED\n   \n  IN TRANSIT\n   \n  NO COMMUNICATION FROM\n   \n  ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\n   \n  STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\n   \n  PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\n   \n  WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n  \n \n  The item below the last one said:\n  \n \n  Pacifica, June 7\u2014The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\nin fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   \n   superior to ourselves in every way\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly.",

HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"",

Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.",

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.",

Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.",

A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie!

What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws.

She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud.

The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   \n   superior to ourselves in every way\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly.",

Flowers,\n   \n  had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\n   \n  hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\n   \n  And the danger from the villain of the piece\n   \n  didn't worry her\u2014I was the guy he was shooting at.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\n   \n   Spacemen's Club\n   \n  in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\nthee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\n  \n \n  A woman here...! The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n\ndocument 2: Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\nsatisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\n  \n \n  MOON SHIP DESTROYED\n   \n  IN TRANSIT\n   \n  NO COMMUNICATION FROM\n   \n  ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\n   \n  STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\n   \n  PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\n   \n  WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n  \n \n  The item below the last one said:\n  \n \n  Pacifica, June 7\u2014The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\nin fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   \n   superior to ourselves in every way\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly.\n\ndocument 3: It was completely illegal, of course. The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n  \n \n  From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n  \n \n  The law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n  \n \n  But everybody knew that if you\n   \n   really\n   \n  wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black\nmarket prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be\ndone.\n  \n \n  Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got\nlost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with\na black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse\noff lower Broadway.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth. We've been expecting\nyou.\"\n\ndocument 4: THE SOUL EATERS\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM CONOVER\n  \n \n  Firebrand Dennis Brooke had one final chance\n   \n  to redeem himself by capturing Koerber whose\n   \n  ships were the scourge of the Void. But his\n   \n  luck had run its course, and now he was\n   \n  marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save\n   \n  himself from a menace weapons could not kill.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"\n   \n   And so, my dear\n   \n  ,\" Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase, \"\n   \n   I'm\nafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014or\nis it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,\nyou'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n\n# plan: The answer should describe the central conflict, the man's altered perception of the world, the societal framework, and the personal loss experienced by the protagonist.\n# important information: A man grappling with unsettling memories, a distorted reality, mysterious regulations, and personal loss.\n\nYou should strirctly follow the instructions below to generate a response to the question in a valid JSON format without any additional text or explanation.\n"

                "Harry Burr is begged by his wife Edna to go see a doctor because she believes that he is sick in the head. He refuses to believe that anything is wrong, but he does admit that there are times where he lies in fear over nothing and mixes up his memories. The story then jumps to the present, where he begins to think about a blond boy named Davie. Edna is confused because they have no children. Edna brings up seeing a doctor again, he angrily responds that it will only be Timkins who brought their son into the world. Edna tells him they had no son, and Timkins died a while ago. The scene cuts to breakfast, where Harry complains about a lack of meat. Edna explains that there is only multi-pro because of the current crisis in the country. Harry begins to go walk outside, but he experiences more strange memories that don\u2019t add up. He picks up the delivery that Edna ordered. Edna asks if there is anything good on television this week because there is only one channel. After a late lunch, Harry goes to check on the animals again and wonders what happened to the rest of the livestock. Edna tells him that they got the same as everyone else, and he goes upstairs again. When he awakes again, Gloria and Walt have arrived. He asks about Penny and Frances. After they leave, He takes his mare Plum out for a ride, and they arrive at a barbed wire fence area up north. He gets over the wire and continues to walk north, until the earth changes to sand. Then, the sand becomes wooden flooring; there is also a loud roaring sound. When he reaches a waist-high metal railing, he runs back to Plum again. Harry has the idea to ride to town, even if the other neighbors tell him to stop and for somebody to call the police. Soon, two policemen come out to escort him to the doctor. Harry asks the doctor where his son is, and the doctor explains that he is dead like so many millions of others. The doctor tells him he has so many things to do, and he says there are a few remaining people who are still alive. Harry\u2019s brain struggles with the impossible concept, and he thinks about how this is not Iowa. Just as Harry realizes what they are on, the switch is thrown, and he finds himself feeling better from the diathermy treatment. Before Harry leaves, the doctor tests him one last time by telling him that they are on an ark. Harry is confused, which means that the treatment works. He goes home to Edna and is happier than ever. ",
                "This story follows Harry, a farmer living in Iowa. He and his wife, Edna, live in a time of crisis and so there are many government regulations to follow. Some of these regulations include food rationing, being restricting to farming vegetables, only being able to travel to the neighbors house, etc. While going about his day, Harry often has visions of a young boy named Davie, someone he understands to be his and Edna's son. He is also constantly discombobulated by the placement of things in the house as well as events that supposedly did or did not happen. This confusion leads Edna to be very worried about him, and she insists for him to visit Dr. Hamming, which he refuses. \n\nOne night, their neighbors Walt and Gloria visit. Harry mistakenly asks about their older daughter - who doesn't exist - and spends the rest of the dinner quiet. After the neighbors leave, Edna is furthermore distraught which prompts Harry to leave the house in hopes of clearing his mind. Outside, he creates a makeshift saddle over his horse, Plum, and rides off into the unplanted fields. After travelling for a while, he and Plum approach a fenced off property labelled \"Phineas Grotton Farm\". Trespassing nonetheless, he rides Plum forwards before pausing; he felt as if everything around him was wrong, including his supposed friend Pangborn putting up a massive fence. \n\nGoing over the fence, he noticed a roaring sound growing louder and the smell of the air changing. As he walked, the ground underneath him changed from earth to sand to wood. He came over to a metal railing and found that it overlooked an endless crashing water and salty air - the ocean. After a while, he rode Plum back to his farm, only to note that he had arrived without even needing to go through town. On the way back, he was spotted breaking travel regulations and was pulled over by the police, who take him to the doctor's office. \n\nAt the doctor's office, his confusion is finally explained away. While being prepped for treatment, Dr. Hamming reveals that his supposed son, Davie, and friend Pangborn, were indeed real and alive, but killed by the bombs. Only a few remain amongst the uninhabitable land, and so it was Dr. Hamming who brought them along to his inhabitable world. Dr. Hamming, his two sons, and his now late wife work together to wipe the bad memories from the townspeople and keep the community going as they, on board an ark, continually search for inhabitable land. As Harry begins to form his own conclusions, Dr. Hammings injects him with the treatment and his sane mind is restored. \n\nAt the end, Harry returns home to his wife. She expresses a worry that he may have taken Plum and broken regulations, to which he insists he would never do. ",
                "Harry seems to have a memory problem. His wife, Edna, often begs him to see the doctor in the town, but he refuses. He often remembers memories that are mismatched with reality. For example, he thinks he has a son, Davie, but all the people, including Edna, deny the fact. He remembers that his fields were planted fully with crops such as wheat and corn, not wasting the land, but now he can only plant a patch of vegetables with all the other fields remaining fallow. He thinks Timkins, the doctor he used to go for, is still alive, but Timkins died a long while ago, based on Edna\u2019s testimony. After eating the rationed food supplied by the government for breakfast, he checks his barn and farms around his house, which seem unfamiliar to him compared to his memory. He picks up the delivery of living supplies and sees the listed movies provided, having the same conversation with Edna as last week. The more he sees, the more he realizes that everything is wrong. When their neighbors visit them and eat with them, Harry has more mistakes in his memory and does not talk while eating. When Edna begs him to see the doctor again, he goes out to ride a mare called Plum.\n\nAt night, Harry rides Plum towards the north on the empty road. Soon after realizing he may be reported for breaking travel regulations, he cuts into an unplanted field. He faces a fenced farm where the owner\u2019s name is unfamiliar with what he remembered to be; he opens it and keeps going northwards. When he reaches the end, he sees a tall metal mesh with barbed wire fence with no gates and climbs to the other side of the fence, seeing nothing but the ocean while standing on the wooden floor. He goes back to the fence, climbs it, and mounts Plum. He tries to find the town but fails. He rides on the road, passing his and his neighbor's houses. People living next to the road shout at him for breaking the regulation, but Harry gives no care to those unfamiliar faces and goes to the southern tip, seeing the extension of the metal fence, climbing through it, and the ocean is there again. When he returns to the fence, two men in police uniforms from a car catch him. He gets in the car, letting one man lead his horse back to his house. They arrive at the doctor\u2019s house, where Harry is told by Doctor Hamming the truth that the people on the ark are the remaining humans in the world. All the other humans might have already died from the bombs, including his son Davie. Harry has those memory problems because his real memory is coming. As soon as Harry realizes what is going on, he forgets it again as the treatment is already applied to him. After the treatment, he returns home and chats with his wife carefreely.\n",
                "Harry has mixed memories and forgets facts from his life. He wakes up in the morning, asking his wife about their son Davie but momentarily remembers that they have no children. He then suggests that he cooks bacon for breakfast but once again recalls that there is a meat ration. His wife Edna asks him to see Dr.Hamming, but Harry is adamant. During breakfast, Harry complains about rations. Edna tells him they will have multi-pro meat for dinner - he is not satisfied. While doing the chores, Harry realizes his barn seems different and unfamiliar. After picking up the delivery, he says that the TV program guide has old moves, but Edna has never seen them. Harry decides to take a nap and feels that everything around him is wrong. After lunch, he goes back to the barn and sees that they have fewer chickens than he remembers. Their neighbors, Walt and Gloria, come over. Harry makes some strange comments about the neighbors' children - he keeps silent for the rest of the evening. Walt and Gloria leave, and Edna asks Harry to go to the doctor again. He leaves for a walk, harnesses his horse, Plum, and heads north towards the town. He soon reaches Phineas Grotton Farm, which he has never seen before. He goes through the gate and continues riding to the north. The countryside seems wrong to him. Soon, he stumbles upon a ten-foot-high fence with a slight inward curve. He ties Plum to the fence, climbs over it, and walks on. The earth beneath his feet turns into the sand and then into wood flooring. He finally sees a metallic railing covered in saltwater. He sees waves beyond the railing - an ocean - and nervously runs back to Plum. He disregards the traveling regulations and rides along the road in the opposite direction - the citizens scream that he is breaking the law. Soon, he reaches the same high fence, railing, and ocean. A police car pulls over: one officer takes Plum, and the other drives Harry to Doctor Hamming. When entering the house, Harry hears some rumbling sound. The doctor, the officers' father, asks about the second son and starts working on Harry, who keeps asking about Davie. The doctor reveals that Harry\u2019s son, just like millions of others, died during a bombing. The doctor claims that he, together with his two sons, is now running the world for the few hundred who survived after putting them on his world with the only uncontaminated soil left. He has to control the crops and livestock. He says he erased all the knowledge about these events to help people remain sane. Harry realizes Davie is dead, and he isn\u2019t in Iowa. The doctor turns off the radio switch, and Harry immediately forgets this. He thanks Hamming for the treatment. Harry hears the doctor say that they are on an ark, but he doesn\u2019t understand what it means and goes home in peace. \n\n\n"

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie!

She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him.

It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond.

Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.",

                        "Harry Burr is begged by his wife Edna to go see a doctor because she believes that he is sick in the head. He refuses to believe that anything is wrong, but he does admit that there are times where he lies in fear over nothing and mixes up his memories. The story then jumps to the present, where he begins to think about a blond boy named Davie. Edna is confused because they have no children. Edna brings up seeing a doctor again, he angrily responds that it will only be Timkins who brought their son into the world. Edna tells him they had no son, and Timkins died a while ago. The scene cuts to breakfast, where Harry complains about a lack of meat. Edna explains that there is only multi-pro because of the current crisis in the country. Harry begins to go walk outside, but he experiences more strange memories that don\u2019t add up. He picks up the delivery that Edna ordered. Edna asks if there is anything good on television this week because there is only one channel. After a late lunch, Harry goes to check on the animals again and wonders what happened to the rest of the livestock. Edna tells him that they got the same as everyone else, and he goes upstairs again. When he awakes again, Gloria and Walt have arrived. He asks about Penny and Frances. After they leave, He takes his mare Plum out for a ride, and they arrive at a barbed wire fence area up north. He gets over the wire and continues to walk north, until the earth changes to sand. Then, the sand becomes wooden flooring; there is also a loud roaring sound. When he reaches a waist-high metal railing, he runs back to Plum again. Harry has the idea to ride to town, even if the other neighbors tell him to stop and for somebody to call the police. Soon, two policemen come out to escort him to the doctor. Harry asks the doctor where his son is, and the doctor explains that he is dead like so many millions of others. The doctor tells him he has so many things to do, and he says there are a few remaining people who are still alive. Harry\u2019s brain struggles with the impossible concept, and he thinks about how this is not Iowa. Just as Harry realizes what they are on, the switch is thrown, and he finds himself feeling better from the diathermy treatment. Before Harry leaves, the doctor tests him one last time by telling him that they are on an ark. Harry is confused, which means that the treatment works. He goes home to Edna and is happier than ever. ",
                        "This story follows Harry, a farmer living in Iowa. He and his wife, Edna, live in a time of crisis and so there are many government regulations to follow. Some of these regulations include food rationing, being restricting to farming vegetables, only being able to travel to the neighbors house, etc. While going about his day, Harry often has visions of a young boy named Davie, someone he understands to be his and Edna's son. He is also constantly discombobulated by the placement of things in the house as well as events that supposedly did or did not happen. This confusion leads Edna to be very worried about him, and she insists for him to visit Dr. Hamming, which he refuses. \n\nOne night, their neighbors Walt and Gloria visit. Harry mistakenly asks about their older daughter - who doesn't exist - and spends the rest of the dinner quiet. After the neighbors leave, Edna is furthermore distraught which prompts Harry to leave the house in hopes of clearing his mind. Outside, he creates a makeshift saddle over his horse, Plum, and rides off into the unplanted fields. After travelling for a while, he and Plum approach a fenced off property labelled \"Phineas Grotton Farm\". Trespassing nonetheless, he rides Plum forwards before pausing; he felt as if everything around him was wrong, including his supposed friend Pangborn putting up a massive fence. \n\nGoing over the fence, he noticed a roaring sound growing louder and the smell of the air changing. As he walked, the ground underneath him changed from earth to sand to wood. He came over to a metal railing and found that it overlooked an endless crashing water and salty air - the ocean. After a while, he rode Plum back to his farm, only to note that he had arrived without even needing to go through town. On the way back, he was spotted breaking travel regulations and was pulled over by the police, who take him to the doctor's office. \n\nAt the doctor's office, his confusion is finally explained away. While being prepped for treatment, Dr. Hamming reveals that his supposed son, Davie, and friend Pangborn, were indeed real and alive, but killed by the bombs. Only a few remain amongst the uninhabitable land, and so it was Dr. Hamming who brought them along to his inhabitable world. Dr. Hamming, his two sons, and his now late wife work together to wipe the bad memories from the townspeople and keep the community going as they, on board an ark, continually search for inhabitable land. As Harry begins to form his own conclusions, Dr. Hammings injects him with the treatment and his sane mind is restored. \n\nAt the end, Harry returns home to his wife. She expresses a worry that he may have taken Plum and broken regulations, to which he insists he would never do. ",
                        "Harry seems to have a memory problem. His wife, Edna, often begs him to see the doctor in the town, but he refuses. He often remembers memories that are mismatched with reality. For example, he thinks he has a son, Davie, but all the people, including Edna, deny the fact. He remembers that his fields were planted fully with crops such as wheat and corn, not wasting the land, but now he can only plant a patch of vegetables with all the other fields remaining fallow. He thinks Timkins, the doctor he used to go for, is still alive, but Timkins died a long while ago, based on Edna\u2019s testimony. After eating the rationed food supplied by the government for breakfast, he checks his barn and farms around his house, which seem unfamiliar to him compared to his memory. He picks up the delivery of living supplies and sees the listed movies provided, having the same conversation with Edna as last week. The more he sees, the more he realizes that everything is wrong. When their neighbors visit them and eat with them, Harry has more mistakes in his memory and does not talk while eating. When Edna begs him to see the doctor again, he goes out to ride a mare called Plum.\n\nAt night, Harry rides Plum towards the north on the empty road. Soon after realizing he may be reported for breaking travel regulations, he cuts into an unplanted field. He faces a fenced farm where the owner\u2019s name is unfamiliar with what he remembered to be; he opens it and keeps going northwards. When he reaches the end, he sees a tall metal mesh with barbed wire fence with no gates and climbs to the other side of the fence, seeing nothing but the ocean while standing on the wooden floor. He goes back to the fence, climbs it, and mounts Plum. He tries to find the town but fails. He rides on the road, passing his and his neighbor's houses. People living next to the road shout at him for breaking the regulation, but Harry gives no care to those unfamiliar faces and goes to the southern tip, seeing the extension of the metal fence, climbing through it, and the ocean is there again. When he returns to the fence, two men in police uniforms from a car catch him. He gets in the car, letting one man lead his horse back to his house. They arrive at the doctor\u2019s house, where Harry is told by Doctor Hamming the truth that the people on the ark are the remaining humans in the world. All the other humans might have already died from the bombs, including his son Davie. Harry has those memory problems because his real memory is coming. As soon as Harry realizes what is going on, he forgets it again as the treatment is already applied to him. After the treatment, he returns home and chats with his wife carefreely.\n",
                        "Harry has mixed memories and forgets facts from his life. He wakes up in the morning, asking his wife about their son Davie but momentarily remembers that they have no children. He then suggests that he cooks bacon for breakfast but once again recalls that there is a meat ration. His wife Edna asks him to see Dr.Hamming, but Harry is adamant. During breakfast, Harry complains about rations. Edna tells him they will have multi-pro meat for dinner - he is not satisfied. While doing the chores, Harry realizes his barn seems different and unfamiliar. After picking up the delivery, he says that the TV program guide has old moves, but Edna has never seen them. Harry decides to take a nap and feels that everything around him is wrong. After lunch, he goes back to the barn and sees that they have fewer chickens than he remembers. Their neighbors, Walt and Gloria, come over. Harry makes some strange comments about the neighbors' children - he keeps silent for the rest of the evening. Walt and Gloria leave, and Edna asks Harry to go to the doctor again. He leaves for a walk, harnesses his horse, Plum, and heads north towards the town. He soon reaches Phineas Grotton Farm, which he has never seen before. He goes through the gate and continues riding to the north. The countryside seems wrong to him. Soon, he stumbles upon a ten-foot-high fence with a slight inward curve. He ties Plum to the fence, climbs over it, and walks on. The earth beneath his feet turns into the sand and then into wood flooring. He finally sees a metallic railing covered in saltwater. He sees waves beyond the railing - an ocean - and nervously runs back to Plum. He disregards the traveling regulations and rides along the road in the opposite direction - the citizens scream that he is breaking the law. Soon, he reaches the same high fence, railing, and ocean. A police car pulls over: one officer takes Plum, and the other drives Harry to Doctor Hamming. When entering the house, Harry hears some rumbling sound. The doctor, the officers' father, asks about the second son and starts working on Harry, who keeps asking about Davie. The doctor reveals that Harry\u2019s son, just like millions of others, died during a bombing. The doctor claims that he, together with his two sons, is now running the world for the few hundred who survived after putting them on his world with the only uncontaminated soil left. He has to control the crops and livestock. He says he erased all the knowledge about these events to help people remain sane. Harry realizes Davie is dead, and he isn\u2019t in Iowa. The doctor turns off the radio switch, and Harry immediately forgets this. He thanks Hamming for the treatment. Harry hears the doctor say that they are on an ark, but he doesn\u2019t understand what it means and goes home in peace. \n\n\n"

His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly.

Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.",

In the control room of Andrews\u2019s space yacht the Carefree, Sparks, the radioman, fails to downplay the seriousness of their situation to Malcolm: the Carefree has been sucked into an unpredictable vortex and the fate of the ship and its occupants is uncertain. \n\tMalcolm approaches the dining room, where Andrews and members of his family are enjoying breakfast. He is unnoticed by his employers, but takes note of Andrews\u2019s beautiful daughter Crystal and her betrothed Ralph Breadon. Suddenly, Andrews calls Malcolm over to complain about the honey and to enquire about the state of the Galactic market. Malcolm, in virtue of the fact that the vortex has blocked communication to and from the Carefree, is unable to answer. Crystal asks Malcolm if they are in danger, but before he is able to answer the question, Crystal\u2019s older brother Bert enters drunkenly and suggests that they are doomed. \nSparks abruptly enters the room and confirms Bert\u2019s drunken suspicion: they have been caught in a gravitation downdraft and must evacuate to a life skiff. On the skiff with members of the Andrews family, Sparks, a cabin-boy, and Breadon, Malcolm navigates above a celestial body and observes the crash of the Carefree. Just as Malcolm surrenders control of the skiff to Breadon, its engines engage and they quickly fall towards the planet. Breadon deftly manipulates the controls, and they land safely. As Malcolm quickly congratulates Breadon on his landing, the latter blames and berates the secretary for the fall. The cabin-boy, however, points out that Breadon\u2019s sleeve was responsible for their descent. \nMalcolm and Sparks examine the damage to the skiff, and Sparks shares his frustrations about Malcolm\u2019s submissive, secretarial behaviour. Malcolm concludes that they are on a rarely-visited, unpopulated, vast, and dangerous moon of Saturn called Titan. Malcolm resolves not to tell the Andrews, fearing that the information would only make them panic. Meanwhile, the Andrews family are in disarray over how best to remove necessities from the skiff.\nBreadon delegates to Sparks the role of establishing communication. Sparks, however, responds poorly and reveals that they are on Titan, and that their chances of rescue are dim. \n",
                "Gregory Malcolm is the secretary of J. Foster Andrews, a wealthy man in charge of the Galactic Metals Corporation. While aboard their ship, Hannigan, a radio operator and companion of Malcolm, discloses that they have entered a vortex and remain trapped with no transmission or radio signal. Hannigan advises that Malcolm doesn't tell the Andrews family and instead waits until there is more information. Malcolm enters the dining dome, where the Andrews family sits, including Crystal, their daughter who Malcolm admires, and Ralph Breadon, her suitor. J. Foster asks Malcolm for information about the corporation's business, to which Malcolm is unable to answer due to the lack of radio transmission. The Andrews family notices the odd situation outside the ship's port and questions Malcolm further, but a drunk Bert Andrews interrupts, panicking and revealing the dire situation at hand. Malcolm reassures the family that there is no immediate danger yet, but Hannigan then enters, urgently yelling at everyone to board the life skiff due to emergency. The team runs to the life skiff, where Malcolm and Hannigan frantically operate it until Breadon insists on taking over. Breadon gains control but the life skiff still faces danger, and as Malcolm and Hannigan scramble over the controls, Breadon steers the life skiff onto the ground; the team survives but the skiff is wrecked. Breadon blames Malcolm for the crash, and Malcolm leaves the situation alone, which Hannigan discourages. After inspection, Malcolm determines that the team has crashed on the planet Titan.",
                "The story starts with Hannigan trying to tell Greg that the atmospherics don\u2019t need to be worried, these are not worth reporting to the boss. However, Greg has studied astrogation and is sure that they are in a vortex. He knows that they have been in the vortex for more than eight hours, but he has no idea how much longer nor how far the ship will go. Agreeing not to tell the boss, Greg goes upstairs to the dining room. Right after he arrives by the door, J. Foster Andrews of Galactic Metals Corporation, starts calling him. He comes in and is asked about the transmission, which he says that there is none. Before he has time to finish explaining himself, Bert Andrews, one of J. Foster Andrews\u2019 son, came in and told everyone that they have been in the vortex for a long time, and they could crash at any moment. J. Foster then turns to confirm with Greg, who explains that it is indeed true, only a bit exaggerated. However, Hannigan comes in and rushes everyone to get on Number Four life-skiff. They are about to crash. \n\nThey all rush to the life-skiff. And Breadon, the person that J. Foster Andrew daughter\u2019s engaged to, tries to get the control from Greg. And in the middle of this, someone hit the control-keys and the motor is killed. Then all of a sudden, Greg, Breadon, and Hannigan all try to reach the control. However, in the end, it is the Breadon that performed the miracle in saving all of them. Later Greg and Hannigan goes to check the ship while others are all doing their own things. Looking around, Greg realizes that they are on Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s satellites. Then Breadon orders Hannigan to send an SOS message to the nearest space cruiser. Hannigan asks Breadon, mockingly, what he should use, and if he knows where they are at. Breadon got stuck with so many questions coming at once, then it is Greg who said: they are on the northern hemisphere of the satellite. ",
                "The story begins with Sparks and Malcolm discussing their predicament on the ship Carefree. The ship is trapped in a vortex that has blown it off course. Malcolm goes to the rotunda where food is being served to the Andrews family. The Andrews family is surrounding the table, including Crystal, who Malcolm fancies. After some loud talking from the family, eventually, Greg informs them that they are in an ionized field and the transmission does not work. The family becomes quite concerned at the news. The son of Andrews, Bert, walks into the doorway in a drunken manner. He tells everyone that they should be concerned. While Malcolm is trying to calm the family down, Sparks runs into the room yelling at everyone to head towards the life skiff. There is a mad rush towards the life skiff that caused a lot of confusion. The Carefree bursts into flames and Malcolm says that he is unsure if the other skiffs were able to escape in time. \n\nMalcolm is piloting the ship when Breadon commands him to hand over the controls. When he does, Breadon\u2019s sleeve brushes against the control keys causing the motors to be turned off. Many people rush to fix the skiff, but Breadon is ultimately the person who guides the skiff to the ground. Breadon yells at Malcolm for interfering, but the cabin boy, Tommy, defends Malcolm. Breadon continues to belittle Malcolm. Sparks tells Malcolm that he is strange and he needs to defend himself against Breadon. \n\nEveryone disembarks from the ship. Bert tries to give orders, but the orders seem to be nonsensical. Malcolm is the first person to realize where the group has crash-landed. Breadon then commands Sparks to send an SOS message. Sparks mocks him by questioning how he should send a message and where he should say they are located, knowing that Breadon does not have the answer. Breadon is not able to specify exactly where they are located. Malcolm completes an experiment that is able to narrow down which hemisphere of the satellite they are located in, displaying a skill that Breadon does not possess. Maud Andrews is inquisitive of how Malcolm could have possibly been able to know where they crash-landed. \n"

                "The story opens at Judy\u2019s house as she has Lois and Lorraine over for lunch. Judy\u2019s lives in her grandparents' old house that she modernized with her husband, Peter. The house has an attic that is up a narrow set of stairs with a door at the top. They have a black cat named Blackberry that spooks her friends because it is creepy when it makes unexpected noises in the attic.\nWhen Judy is recalling the story of the fountain, the narrative bounces back and forth into their present reality as Lois and Lorraine ask questions.\nIn Judy\u2019s recalled story, she is a young red-haired girl with no friends who spends two weeks in the summer with her grandparents at their home. They have a hot attic filled with keepsakes and old reading materials, most notably a picture of a fountain that Judy\u2019s grandmother later brings her to. The fountain was centered in a deep, circular pool, and had steps leading up to it that were bordered with smaller fountains of lions with water spurting out of the mouths. Judy thinks it could be a beautiful location at any time of the year, surrounded by lush vegetation like rhododendrons and evergreens. From the fountain there was a path leading to a windowless old tower that was populated by cupids and gnomes that peered out at Judy.\nBack in modern day, when Judy, Lois and Lorraine go looking for the fountain, the tower is still visible, and Lorraine describes it as something out of \u201cGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.\u201d The friends visit it on a day where the trees are leafless in the woods, making the rhododendrons appear vibrantly green, under a gray sky. They do not actually reach the fountain in the story, but they do pass several posted signs for \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d along the wooded road.\n",
                "The house that Judy lives in was inherited from her grandparents, and she now lives there with her husband Peter and their cat Blackberry. She has made some changes to the house, including in the staircases to the attic, but she has not yet gone through all of her grandmother's belongings so they take up a lot of the attic. Judy's friends consider the house haunted, but Judy insists that at least the attic is not. After the three leave the house to investigate where the fountain might be, they head into the woods where there is an uphill road leading to the Brandt estate. In this estate, there was an old water tower that was visible from the path the women were on, but the story ended before the women were able to confirm if the fountain was on this estate or not. ",
                "The story takes place around the early 20th century in a town called Farringdon in the USA as Judy\u2019s grandparents still drove a horse-led wagon, but Lois now drives a car, and Judy\u2019s husband is employed by the FBI. The story begins at Judy\u2019s house, which she inherited from her grandparents. While she is in the process of renovating the house, she still has her grandmother\u2019s things in the attic, including the magazine with the picture of the fountain. Lois alludes to the fact that Judy has tracked down the ghosts in the attic and cellar of the house. The attic is where Judy found the magazine with the picture of the fountain on it that she is telling her friends about. When Judy saw the picture, she had never seen a fountain in person, although there is a fountain at the nearby turreted Farringdon-Petts mansion. After Judy shows the picture of the fountain to Lois and Lorraine, the two women recognize it as the fountain on the Brandt estate.\n        The fountain is part of the setting in the flashback in the story. Judy remembers visiting the fountain during June; it was centered in a deep, circular pool with steps leading to the fountain. Smaller fountains in the shapes of lions were beside the steps, and water spurted from their mouths. After leaving the fountain, Judy found a hammock in a beautiful garden encircled by rose trellises. There were also rhododendrons and evergreens in the garden. After waking from her nap in the hammock, Judy saw an old windowless tower and a path leading to it. She followed the trail, and all along it were cupid and gnome figures that seemed to be looking out at her, tucked into surprising places. Just as she reached the tower, she heard her grandfather leaving with the wagon.  \n\tThe rest of the story occurs in the present\u2019s second setting, the Brandt estate. The drive off the main road is a narrow, gravel road uphill through the woods. An oncoming car driven by a swarthy man with hypnotic eyes startles them. Traveling on, they pass more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendron and can see the tower from the car. As Lois turns the car around, two figures in dark coats approach them.\n",
                "Most of the story takes place in Judy's grandparents' house, which Judy currently owns and has modernized. The main focus of the first half of the story is on the house's attic, where Judy's grandmother's things are kept. The story also takes place in a car on the way to the Brandt estate, which is the location of the fountain. The characters wind up on the estate, but it is a private estate and there are people there who do not want them there. The story takes place in a time period that seems older, with a lot of pomp and propriety. "

Judy\u2019s lives in her grandparents' old house that she modernized with her husband, Peter. The house has an attic that is up a narrow set of stairs with a door at the top. They have a black cat named Blackberry that spooks her friends because it is creepy when it makes unexpected noises in the attic.\nWhen Judy is recalling the story of the fountain, the narrative bounces back and forth into their present reality as Lois and Lorraine ask questions.\nIn Judy\u2019s recalled story, she is a young red-haired girl with no friends who spends two weeks in the summer with her grandparents at their home. They have a hot attic filled with keepsakes and old reading materials, most notably a picture of a fountain that Judy\u2019s grandmother later brings her to. The fountain was centered in a deep, circular pool, and had steps leading up to it that were bordered with smaller fountains of lions with water spurting out of the mouths. Judy thinks it could be a beautiful location at any time of the year, surrounded by lush vegetation like rhododendrons and evergreens. From the fountain there was a path leading to a windowless old tower that was populated by cupids and gnomes that peered out at Judy.\nBack in modern day, when Judy, Lois and Lorraine go looking for the fountain, the tower is still visible, and Lorraine describes it as something out of \u201cGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.\u201d The friends visit it on a day where the trees are leafless in the woods, making the rhododendrons appear vibrantly green, under a gray sky. They do not actually reach the fountain in the story, but they do pass several posted signs for \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d along the wooded road.\n",

Judy's friends consider the house haunted, but Judy insists that at least the attic is not.

In addition, she does not like the idea of animals that can crawl on her or vegetation existing unintentionally. She also does not like the smells of different planets. When Mia sees individuals with more than one child, she becomes nauseous at the sight. To Mia, that seems reckless to have so many children as she is taught that it was the cause of Earth\u2019s destruction. Another occurrence that Mia finds interesting is when she sees an old man during her travels. She is fascinated by his white hair, which she notes that she had never seen in person before. ",
                "Firstly, the planet Tintera has not been in contact with the Ship for almost 150 years. For the first two days in her Trial she sees nothing except some odd looking animals. To her surprise, they actually taste good, while some other good looking things do not taste so good. She also notices the ugly animals that Horst and his men are herding. Secondly, the town shocks her. Everything there are out of date. The truck she saw is the most advanced machine they have. The newspaper at the rear of the town has \u201cinvasion\u201d printed on them. There are literally no women older than 10 years old, only men, boys and kids. She feels weird. But after she sees the swarming kids, she realizes that those people are Free Birthers. She feels sick by what she sees in this sight since they are the ones that basically destroyed Earth. Moreover, to her surprises, they don\u2019t even seem to remember about the things that they\u2019ve done to Earth at all. ",
                "Mia harbors a dislike for planets, particularly because she is unaccustomed to certain aspects. Specifically, she feels the attractive force gravity is different from on the ship where she lives. She is unfamiliar with the ubiquitous vegetation and the fauna. Furthermore, Mia mentions that she is not used to having the lights go out, suggesting that the lights on the ship stay on at all times. Most of all, however, she dislikes the smell of planets. Though there is a relatively small space on her ship on the third level which bear semblance to planets, it is different from Tintera in that Mia is able to leave when she feels uncomfortable. \n\tAdditionally, Tintera\u2019s human culture is different from on the ship. Whereas the inhabitants of the ship are bound by a culture which prohibits unregulated reproduction, the people of Tintera are Free Birthers unconcerned with such matters. When Mia discovers this, she feels nauseated and disgusted at their behaviour. \n",
                "Tintera has many differences from the life on the ship that Mia is used to. Firstly, and as is similar for all planets, it has an unpleasant smell in its atmosphere. The seasons are also different; despite it being December on the ship, it is spring on Tintera. The planet also has animals that Mia is not used to seeing; for example, the strange creatures that she sees being herded by the men on horseback. The biggest difference that Mia notes about Tintera is that here, people have multiple children who roam about freely. This goes against the rules of the Council and frightens Mia. "

Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n  \n \n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.",

Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  'Evening, Cap'n.'\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  'Evening, Conan,' he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it 'the canary;' Louisiana State\ncalled it 'the red hats;' elsewhere it was called 'the hole,' 'the\nsnake pit,' 'the Klondike.' When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  'Owoo-o-o,' screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n'Yow-w-w!' shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: 'Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.'\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  'Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !' The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. 'Here they are,' Sodaro told them. 'Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.' He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: 'A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here.

And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n  \n \n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.",

Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n  \n \n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.\n\ndocument 2: My Lady Greensleeves\n  \n \n  By FREDERIK POHL\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction February 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   This guard smelled trouble and it could be\n    \n   counted on to come\u2014for a nose for trouble\n    \n   was one of the many talents bred here!\n   \n \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  His name was Liam O'Leary and there was something stinking in his\nnostrils. It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble\nwas yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of\nguards in Estates-General Correctional Institution\u2014better known to\nits inmates as the Jug\u2014and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent\nof trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to\nreach his captaincy.\n  \n \n  And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n  \n \n  He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like\nher into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she\ncouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n  \n \n  He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n  \n \n  The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\nguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the\n   \n   Civil\nService Guide to Prison Administration\n   \n  : \"Detainees will be permitted\nto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary\nwas a man who lived by the book.\n  \n \n  She burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told\nme I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush\nup, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and\ntold them I refused to mop.\"\n  \n \n  The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk\u2014that's what she was telling you\nto do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n\n# plan: Provide a detailed description of Sue-Ann Bradley's role and traits based on the information found in the documents.\n# important information: Sue-Ann Bradley is a key figure in the story, with a significant role in the correctional institution.

Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n  \n \n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch.",

She is a recent prisoner and has not been in prison for as long as many other inmates. Her parents both work in Civil Service. She has an excellent educational background and basically whatever a girl could want. However, she chooses to abandon all of that when she lets herself get tangled in dirty business that leads to her arrest. The main reason for her arrest is for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. She is also described to be a figger-lover because of her actions. Sue-Ann comes off as defiant and courageous when she first steps forward to confront Sandro and O\u2019Leary to explain her side regarding the offense that Mathias reports her for doing. Inside Block O, she tries to walk bravely across the tanglefoot electronic fields only to fall on her face. Even though Sue-Ann is grateful to the guard for letting her attend to her affairs, she does make an effort to ignore him proudly. Despite this brave exterior that Sue-Ann exhibits, she does have moments of weakness. She begins to weep sincerely once the howling and screaming get worse. Although she initially refuses to let the guards hear her, she is eventually driven crazy by the senseless yelling and begins to weep freely. ",
                        "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young girl, of quite a high status, the idea of which she tries to reject throughout the story. Her parents are civil service, which, while not the highest status, is respectable. She has tried to violate the categorised class laws, by being in love with a person who is below her own class. She has been put in prison for it. She is clearly not used to the gruff nature of the prison system, and doesn't understand the slang that the other inmates use. She is clearly quite emotional, not calling the Captain ``Sir\" out of anger, retching when she sees Flock and Sauer and weeping eventually in her cell. When she is in Block O, she notes to herself that it is a good thing that Sauer and Flock were still fighting against the system. She clearly values freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom to love whoever, freedom from this sectorial way of life. ",

She is in the institution because of conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Her parents are of the Civil Service class and she was given a good education. Sue-Ann does not like to show that she is scared or nervous and it is evident that is very prideful from the way she conducts herself throughout the prison. She is not afraid to defend herself. ",

She was brought up in a perfect environment and surprisingly got mixed into violating the Categories Class laws. She insists she made mistakes in the institution due to the lack of knowledge about her duties. She is emotional and appears angry with the unjust accusations and on the verge of hysteria. She tries to behave boldly and be careful, but just the sight of some makes her shake from the desire to retch. She appreciates resentment and anger and possesses these features. She is scared and disgusted with animal-like behavior and screams though. She is strong, nevertheless, and manages to behave decently.

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone!

A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"",

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.",

In the story 'The Ghost Ship,' the captain of the Mary Lou, after a long journey in space, realizes that the crew's ship is gradually losing its mass and energy, becoming a mere shell. This realization forces the captain to make the difficult decision to return to Earth, as the crew would otherwise be unable to return due to the relative nature of existence in space. This decision impacts the crew's morale significantly, as they had been on a long journey with the hope of returning to Earth. In 'The Reorientations,' the captain's cautious approach to the unknown planet Alphard Six highlights the need to prioritize the crew's safety and mental health over the mission's objectives. The crew in 'The Reorientations' faces the risk of encountering an alien threat, and the captain's decision to follow standard procedure and caution ensures the crew's well-being. In 'The Space Rat,' the captain's decision to return to Earth is a reflection of the personal and professional sacrifices made by spacemen, who often choose to die in space rather than return to a life they perceive as less fulfilling. The captain's decision in 'The Space Rat' is a culmination of the journey's impact on the crew, emphasizing the importance of personal fulfillment and the crew's collective well-being.",

He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  'Have a seat, Major,' he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  'Sir?' the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  'We're out of cigarettes, Joe,' the Captain said. 'Will you get us\nsome, please?'\n  \n \n  'Sure thing,' the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  'They steal them,' Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  'Steal what?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.'\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  'All right,' I said, 'suppose we start at the beginning.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. 'Sir?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  'I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Is there a local hero named Joe?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'No, no, nothing like that,' he assured me. 'It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.'\n  \n \n  'I can see that,' I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  'And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.'\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  'It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,'\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  'Get to the point, Captain!' I barked.\n  \n \n  'Easy, sir,' Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. 'The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?'\n  \n \n  'I follow, all right,' I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  'Well,' Bransten went on, 'that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.'\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  'Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.'\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  'I understand perfectly,' I snapped. 'Where are my quarters?'\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  'What is it, Major?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'This man Joe,' I said. 'Can you give me any more on him?'\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. 'Why, Major,' he said, 'you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?'\n  \n \n  'None at all,' I snapped back. 'I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....'\n  \n \n  'Take your time, Major,' Walsh beamed. 'There's no rush at all.'\n  \n \n  'I thought....'\n  \n \n  'I'm sure you can do the job,' Walsh cut in. 'I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.'\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. 'Look....'\n  \n \n  'He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,' Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Polk!' he shouted, 'can you hear me?'\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  'Joe?' I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  'Who else, boss?' he answered.\n  \n \n  'I'm trying to locate someone,' I said. 'I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?'\n  \n \n  'It'll cost you, boss,' the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  'How much?'\n  \n \n  'Two cartons of cigarettes at least.'\n  \n \n  'Who's the guide?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'How's the price sound?'\n  \n \n  'Fine, fine,' I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  'His name is Joe,' the Venusian told me. 'Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....'\n  \n \n  'Skip it,' I said, cutting the promotion short. 'Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.'\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  'And Joe,' I said, stopping him at the door, 'I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.'\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. 'No danger of that, boss,' he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  'Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,' Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. 'Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. 'Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?'\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  'No point in taking chances,'\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. 'We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.'\n  \n \n  'And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,' Farrell said acidly, 'when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!'\n  \n \n  'But I saw them,' Stryker\nsaid. 'I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?'\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  'Gib's right,' he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . 'We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?'\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  'So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,'\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. 'Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.'\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  'Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.'\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n'What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?'\n  \n \n  'I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.'\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  'That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,' he said. 'And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.' Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. 'We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.'\n  \n \n  'They can't be Hymenops,'\nGibson said promptly. 'First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.'\n  \n \n  'There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,' Farrell pointed out.\n'Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.'\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.'\n  \n \n  'But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,' Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n'Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.'\n  \n \n  'The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,' Stryker\nsaid. 'Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.'\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  'We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.'\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  'If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,' he said,\n'then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?'\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, 'Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.'\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. 'If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?'\n  \n \n \n  'Aye, there's the rub,' Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. 'If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.'\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. 'We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?'\n  \n \n  'I'd like to go,' Gibson said\nat once. 'The ZIT computer can\nwait.'\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. 'No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.'\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  'You two did the field work\non the last location,' he said.\n'It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.'\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  'Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.'\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  'They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,' he\nsaid. 'Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?'\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. 'All\nright, Arthur?'\n  \n \n  'Good enough,' Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n'How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?'\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. 'The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  'At least they're human,'\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n'Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. 'Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.'\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. 'The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.'\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!'\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. 'Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.'\n  \n \n  'They're not alien,' Gibson\nsaid positively. 'Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Are thrust reaction jets,'\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. 'Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n'Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.'\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, 'If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?'\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Logic or not-logic,' Gibson\nsaid. 'If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,' Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, '\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  'If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,' Gibson\nfinished. 'Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.'\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  'The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?'\n  \n \n  'It couldn't have been built\nhere,' Stryker said. 'Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.'\n  \n \n  'We progress,' Farrell said\ndryly. 'Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.'\n  \n \n  'I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,' Gibson said calmly.\n'The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. 'I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.'\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.'\n  \n \n  'Then we can eliminate this\none now,' Farrell said flatly. 'It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.'\n  \n \n  'Arthur's right,' Stryker said\nreluctantly. 'An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014'\n  \n \n  'And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,'\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n'The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.'\n  \n \n  'But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,' Gibson said, 'and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. 'But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?'\n  \n \n  'We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,' Gibson reminded\nhim. 'We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?'\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. 'Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?'\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. 'The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.'\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: 'I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.'\n  \n \n  'Don't,' Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. 'I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.'\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  'I'm passing over a hamlet,'\nFarrell reported. 'The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014'\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  'A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,' he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  'What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!'\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. 'It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.'\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, 'I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?'\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  'No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014'\n  \n \n  'It wasn't a torpedo at all,'\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. 'They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.'\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  'We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,'\nGibson said. 'These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.'\n  \n \n  'They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?'\n  \n \n  'The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,' Gibson said.\n'But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.'\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. 'The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?'\n  \n \n  'From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,' Gibson said patiently.\n'The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  'Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.'\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. 'An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,' he said. 'These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  'But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!'\n  \n \n  'But it does, for once,' Gibson\nsaid. 'The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. 'It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?'\n  \n \n  'Of course,' said Gibson, surprised.\n'It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.'\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n  \n \n  He punched up his pillow and settled back. 'I guess so. But when I\nthink of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far\nhave you got in the tractors?'\n  \n \n  'I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the\nspaceship where they belong. We\n   \n   shouldn't\n   \n  risk losing them and\ngetting stuck here.'\n  \n \n  'Are you settling for a primary exploration?'\n  \n \n  'No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to\nmeet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and\ntastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.\nOut there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien\nlanguages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.\nUsing the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as\neasily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.'\n  \n \n  'I doubt that that is necessary, sir,' Quade said. 'Experienced\nspacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In\nthe future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing\nto death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.'\n  \n \n  I examined his bandisprayed hide. 'I think my way of gaining experience\nis less painful and more efficient.'\n  \n \n  Quade squirmed. 'Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you\ngot me away from those aliens.'\n  \n \n  'The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they\nwere prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men\ngot out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\nthan they could.'\n  \n \n  'I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all\nthe time.'\n  \n \n  'But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into\ndanger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we\nwere trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered\nus one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for\nus. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village\nidiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that\nfar up the intelligence scale.'\n  \n \n  'But why should they want to help us?' Quade demanded suspiciously.\n  \n \n  'I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted\nsomebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens\n   \n   want\n   \n  Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog\ncame to Nagurski.'\n  \n \n  'Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,' Quade said. 'I've been\na blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on\n   \n   some\n   \n  worlds,\n   \n   most\n   \n  worlds, but not good on\n   \n   all\n   \n  worlds. I'm never\ngoing to be that foolhardy again.'\n  \n \n  'But you're losing\n   \n   confidence\n   \n  , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any\nmore. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?'\n  \n \n  'The hell it is,' Quade said grimly. 'It's his deadliest liability.'\n  \n \n  'In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting\nExecutive Officer.'\n  \n \n  'Huh?' Quade gawked. 'But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!\nI'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!'\n  \n \n  'That's tough,' I sympathized, 'but in every service a chap gets broken\nin rank now and then.'\n  \n \n  'Maybe it's worth it,' Quade said heavily. 'Now maybe I've learned how\nto stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.'\n  \n \n  I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and\nI could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of\nexperience aboard.\n  \n \n  'Quade,' I said, 'space isn't as dangerous as all that.' I clapped him\non the shoulder fraternally. 'You worry too much!'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  'I'll call the captain,' the space man said. 'He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.'\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  'How do you feel, Space Man Willard?'\n  \n \n  'Oh, you know me?' Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n'Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  'You don't know how much I suffered there,' Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. 'Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!'\n  \n \n  'Yes?' the old captain said.\n  \n \n  'Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!'\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  'I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.'\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  'When will we go to Earth?' he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  'You don't know,' the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  'Matter is relative,' he said, 'the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  'Then this ship,' Willard said, stunned, 'you and I and everything on\nit...'\n  \n \n  '... are doomed,' the Captain said. 'We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!'\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  'Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!'\n  \n \n  'Yes.'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 211\nDocument 2 text: Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  'Have a seat, Major,' he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  'Sir?' the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  'We're out of cigarettes, Joe,' the Captain said. 'Will you get us\nsome, please?'\n  \n \n  'Sure thing,' the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  'They steal them,' Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  'Steal what?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.'\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  'All right,' I said, 'suppose we start at the beginning.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. 'Sir?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.'\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  'I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Is there a local hero named Joe?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'No, no, nothing like that,' he assured me. 'It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.'\n  \n \n  'I can see that,' I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  'And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.'\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  'It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,'\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  'Get to the point, Captain!' I barked.\n  \n \n  'Easy, sir,' Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. 'The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?'\n  \n \n  'I follow, all right,' I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  'Well,' Bransten went on, 'that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.'\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  'Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.'\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  'I understand perfectly,' I snapped. 'Where are my quarters?'\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  'What is it, Major?' he asked.\n  \n \n  'This man Joe,' I said. 'Can you give me any more on him?'\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. 'Why, Major,' he said, 'you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?'\n  \n \n  'None at all,' I snapped back. 'I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....'\n  \n \n  'Take your time, Major,' Walsh beamed. 'There's no rush at all.'\n  \n \n  'I thought....'\n  \n \n  'I'm sure you can do the job,' Walsh cut in. 'I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.'\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. 'Look....'\n  \n \n  'He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,' Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Polk!' he shouted, 'can you hear me?'\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  'Joe?' I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  'Who else, boss?' he answered.\n  \n \n  'I'm trying to locate someone,' I said. 'I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?'\n  \n \n  'It'll cost you, boss,' the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  'How much?'\n  \n \n  'Two cartons of cigarettes at least.'\n  \n \n  'Who's the guide?' I asked.\n  \n \n  'How's the price sound?'\n  \n \n  'Fine, fine,' I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  'His name is Joe,' the Venusian told me. 'Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....'\n  \n \n  'Skip it,' I said, cutting the promotion short. 'Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.'\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  'And Joe,' I said, stopping him at the door, 'I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.'\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. 'No danger of that, boss,' he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  'Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,' Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. 'Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. 'Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?'\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  'No point in taking chances,'\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. 'We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.'\n  \n \n  'And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,' Farrell said acidly, 'when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!'\n  \n \n  'But I saw them,' Stryker\nsaid. 'I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?'\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  'Gib's right,' he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . 'We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?'\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  'So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,'\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. 'Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.'\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  'Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.'\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n'What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?'\n  \n \n  'I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.'\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  'That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,' he said. 'And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.' Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. 'We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.'\n  \n \n  'They can't be Hymenops,'\nGibson said promptly. 'First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.'\n  \n \n  'There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,' Farrell pointed out.\n'Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.'\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.'\n  \n \n  'But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,' Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n'Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.'\n  \n \n  'The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,' Stryker\nsaid. 'Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.'\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  'We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.'\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  'If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,' he said,\n'then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?'\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, 'Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.'\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. 'If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?'\n  \n \n \n  'Aye, there's the rub,' Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. 'If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.'\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. 'We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?'\n  \n \n  'I'd like to go,' Gibson said\nat once. 'The ZIT computer can\nwait.'\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. 'No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.'\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  'You two did the field work\non the last location,' he said.\n'It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.'\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  'Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.'\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  'They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,' he\nsaid. 'Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?'\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. 'All\nright, Arthur?'\n  \n \n  'Good enough,' Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n'How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?'\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. 'The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  'At least they're human,'\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n'Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. 'Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.'\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. 'The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.'\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!'\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. 'Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.'\n  \n \n  'They're not alien,' Gibson\nsaid positively. 'Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Are thrust reaction jets,'\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. 'Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?'\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n'Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.'\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, 'If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?'\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  'Logic or not-logic,' Gibson\nsaid. 'If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,' Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, '\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .'\n  \n \n  'If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,' Gibson\nfinished. 'Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.'\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  'The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?'\n  \n \n  'It couldn't have been built\nhere,' Stryker said. 'Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.'\n  \n \n  'We progress,' Farrell said\ndryly. 'Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.'\n  \n \n  'I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,' Gibson said calmly.\n'The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. 'I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.'\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. 'We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.'\n  \n \n  'Then we can eliminate this\none now,' Farrell said flatly. 'It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.'\n  \n \n  'Arthur's right,' Stryker said\nreluctantly. 'An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014'\n  \n \n  'And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,'\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n'The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.'\n  \n \n  'But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,' Gibson said, 'and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. 'But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?'\n  \n \n  'We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,' Gibson reminded\nhim. 'We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?'\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. 'Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?'\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. 'The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.'\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: 'I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.'\n  \n \n  'Don't,' Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. 'I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.'\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  'I'm passing over a hamlet,'\nFarrell reported. 'The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014'\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  'A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,' he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  'What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!'\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. 'It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.'\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, 'I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?'\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  'No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.'\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014'\n  \n \n  'It wasn't a torpedo at all,'\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. 'They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.'\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  'We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,'\nGibson said. 'These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.'\n  \n \n  'They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?'\n  \n \n  'The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,' Gibson said.\n'But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.'\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. 'The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?'\n  \n \n  'From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,' Gibson said patiently.\n'The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  'Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.'\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. 'An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,' he said. 'These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.'\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  'But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!'\n  \n \n  'But it does, for once,' Gibson\nsaid. 'The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.'\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. 'It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?'\n  \n \n  'Of course,' said Gibson, surprised.\n'It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.'\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  'Sometimes,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'It has other names?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It has no name,' Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  'Yet you call it Earth?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I do,' Korvin said, 'for convenience.'\n  \n \n  'Do you know its location?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'Not with exactitude,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. 'But you can find it again,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I can,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'And you will tell us about it?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will,' Korvin said, 'so far as I am able.'\n  \n \n  'We will wish to know about weapons,' the Ruler said, 'and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. 'Both,' he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. 'We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?'\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. 'It is,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,'\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It is,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Who is it that governs?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  'The answer to that question,' Korvin said, 'cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  'Any question of fact has an answer,' the Ruler snapped. 'A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?'\n  \n \n  'Certainly,' Korvin said. 'It is completely obvious and true.'\n  \n \n  'The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor for this system,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. 'Explain this governor to us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'The explanation cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. 'Is the deficiency in you?' he said. 'Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?'\n  \n \n  'It can be described,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will not,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. 'You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. 'I am attempting,' he said, 'not to\nconfuse you.'\n  \n \n  'Then I ask for an answer,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I request that I be allowed to ask a question,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. 'Ask it,' he said. 'We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.'\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. 'Well, then,' he said, 'what is your\ngovernment?'\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. 'Our government is the only logical form of government,' he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. 'The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.'\n  \n \n  'You have heard our government defined,' the Ruler said. 'Now, you\nwill define yours for us.'\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. 'If you insist,' he said, 'I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. 'We shall understand,' he said. 'Begin. Who governs\nyou?'\n  \n \n  'None,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'But you are governed?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. 'Yes.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor,' the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said. 'But everyone is the governor.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is no government,' the Ruler said. 'There is no single\ndecision.'\n  \n \n  'No,' Korvin said equably, 'there are many decisions binding on all.'\n  \n \n  'Who makes them binding?' the Ruler asked. 'Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?'\n  \n \n  'Many of them are unfavorable,' Korvin said. 'But we are not forced to\naccept them.'\n  \n \n  'Do you act against your own interests?'\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'Not knowingly,' he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. 'I told you you wouldn't understand it,' he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  'It is a defect in your explanation,' the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  'My explanation is as exact as it can be,' he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. 'Let us try something else,' he said.\n'Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Neither have we,' Korvin said. 'We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.'\n  \n \n  'But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014'\n  \n \n  'We have no need of one,' Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  'Ah,' the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. 'And why\nnot?'\n  \n \n  'We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,' Korvin said. 'It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.'\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. 'The beings themselves rule each\nother?' he said. 'This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.'\n  \n \n  'That is our form of government,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'You are lying,' the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: 'The machine tells us\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Then the machine is faulty,' the expert said. 'It will be corrected.'\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming.

Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical.

That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 805\nDocument 2 text: 'The name of your planet is Earth?' the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  'Sometimes,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'It has other names?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It has no name,' Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  'Yet you call it Earth?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I do,' Korvin said, 'for convenience.'\n  \n \n  'Do you know its location?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'Not with exactitude,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. 'But you can find it again,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I can,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'And you will tell us about it?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will,' Korvin said, 'so far as I am able.'\n  \n \n  'We will wish to know about weapons,' the Ruler said, 'and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. 'Both,' he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. 'We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?'\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. 'It is,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,'\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It is,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Who is it that governs?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  'The answer to that question,' Korvin said, 'cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  'Any question of fact has an answer,' the Ruler snapped. 'A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?'\n  \n \n  'Certainly,' Korvin said. 'It is completely obvious and true.'\n  \n \n  'The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor for this system,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. 'Explain this governor to us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'The explanation cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. 'Is the deficiency in you?' he said. 'Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?'\n  \n \n  'It can be described,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will not,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. 'You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. 'I am attempting,' he said, 'not to\nconfuse you.'\n  \n \n  'Then I ask for an answer,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I request that I be allowed to ask a question,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. 'Ask it,' he said. 'We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.'\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. 'Well, then,' he said, 'what is your\ngovernment?'\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. 'Our government is the only logical form of government,' he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. 'The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.'\n  \n \n  'You have heard our government defined,' the Ruler said. 'Now, you\nwill define yours for us.'\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. 'If you insist,' he said, 'I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. 'We shall understand,' he said. 'Begin. Who governs\nyou?'\n  \n \n  'None,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'But you are governed?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. 'Yes.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor,' the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said. 'But everyone is the governor.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is no government,' the Ruler said. 'There is no single\ndecision.'\n  \n \n  'No,' Korvin said equably, 'there are many decisions binding on all.'\n  \n \n  'Who makes them binding?' the Ruler asked. 'Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?'\n  \n \n  'Many of them are unfavorable,' Korvin said. 'But we are not forced to\naccept them.'\n  \n \n  'Do you act against your own interests?'\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'Not knowingly,' he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. 'I told you you wouldn't understand it,' he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  'It is a defect in your explanation,' the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  'My explanation is as exact as it can be,' he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. 'Let us try something else,' he said.\n'Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Neither have we,' Korvin said. 'We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.'\n  \n \n  'But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014'\n  \n \n  'We have no need of one,' Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  'Ah,' the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. 'And why\nnot?'\n  \n \n  'We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,' Korvin said. 'It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.'\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. 'The beings themselves rule each\nother?' he said. 'This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.'\n  \n \n  'That is our form of government,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'You are lying,' the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: 'The machine tells us\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Then the machine is faulty,' the expert said. 'It will be corrected.'\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be.

He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.",

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

You have to\nmeet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and\ntastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.\nOut there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien\nlanguages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.\nUsing the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as\neasily.

First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into\ndanger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we\nwere trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered\nus one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for\nus.

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space.

He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.",

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.",

Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct.

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another.

That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.",

How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n\ndocument 4: And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\n\n# plan: Based on the gathered information, explain the reasons for the captain's decision and its impact on the crew and mission.\n# important information: The crew's mission, the unforeseen circumstances, the captain's decision, the crew's morale, and the potential consequences of the decision.\n\nYou should strirctly follow the instructions below to generate a response to the question in a valid JSON format without any additional text or explanation.\n"

From the joy an tears of the passengers once they acknowledge Earth has been sighted, we know \u2013 they are happy and want to return home. Just as Llud stated, he is still a part of Earth. ",
                        "Omega Centauri was a globular cluster that had a hundred thousand stars in a comparatively small volume. There was hope that Omega Centauri of all places would possess the planet necessary for human survival. The issue was that it was twenty thousand light-years away. With the limited fuel reserves that the Quest III ship had left, going to Omega Centauri would be a one-way trip. If the globular cluster proved to be as useless as every other location, the ship and its crew members would have no fuel to go anywhere else. Earth was a safer option because its existence was reality, at least when the ships left 900 Earth years ago. Omega Centauri was very uncertain. "

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist.

How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it.

It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool.

And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk.

It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad.

I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth.

A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another.

That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it.

Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach.

The crew had been on a long journey with the hope of returning to Earth, and the captain's decision ensures their well-being.

On the other hand, all the people the crew knew had died a long time ago, and there was some frightening uncertainty about what awaited them upon return. Therefore, the decision was hard to make. Even more difficult it was for the captain as he didn't want to return with the news of failure. Soon, it turns out that the return was a dangerous choice and the crew is not welcome. The ship is attacked and the enemy threatens to destroy the ship, which can't turn away as it is out of fuel. Therefore, this decision put the whole crew in danger instead of fulfilling their hopes for warm welcome and excitement to come home. ",
                        "The captain could have advised the ship to go to Omega Centauri, a cluster of globes further past the point of Quest III's voyage. Omega Centauri contains many planets close to its Sun, and for this reason would likely be a place where several habitable planets can be found. However, Omega Centauri is too far for Quest III to make the trip there and back to Earth, so if they went there, they would not be able to return. The captain notes this risk, and decides to return back to Earth. However, this ends up being a mistake, and as Quest III returns to Earth they are attacked and unwelcome. ",

While Quest III could get to Omega Centauri with its remaining fuel, it can only be a one-way journey. Moreover, even if it has enough fuel for the round trip, forty thousand years would have passed, there is no point in returning, when it is unclear if human race itself still remains. Most importantly, the crew has been showing signs of homesick, despite the fact that what was known as home is probably gone. From the joy an tears of the passengers once they acknowledge Earth has been sighted, we know \u2013 they are happy and want to return home. Just as Llud stated, he is still a part of Earth. ",
                        "Omega Centauri was a globular cluster that had a hundred thousand stars in a comparatively small volume. There was hope that Omega Centauri of all places would possess the planet necessary for human survival. The issue was that it was twenty thousand light-years away. With the limited fuel reserves that the Quest III ship had left, going to Omega Centauri would be a one-way trip. If the globular cluster proved to be as useless as every other location, the ship and its crew members would have no fuel to go anywhere else. Earth was a safer option because its existence was reality, at least when the ships left 900 Earth years ago. Omega Centauri was very uncertain. "

Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it.

Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach.

                "The symptoms of the fever are described as \u201cgarrulousness\u201d followed by the victims leaving their post and walking into the Baldric desert.\n\nThe fever is brought on by infra-red rays from Jupiter\u2019s great spot. Normally, people on this moon aren\u2019t coming down with the fever from their regular activities. However, a lens-like device mounted in the window of the worker barracks at Larynx Incorporated projects the infra-red rays from the great spot around the room onto the sleeping workers which puts them into this trance-like state.\n\nAntlers Karn is responsible for causing the Red Spot Fever by having the devices installed in his competitors' barracks. He also claims to have developed an antitoxin that would reverse the fever, however, it is implied that this was only a lie to cover up his actions.\n",
                "Red Spot Fever makes the people who catch it start to talk a lot, and after rambling for a while the people wander into the Baldric as long as they can do so unnoticed. When someone is watching them to try to see where they are going, they stop until they can slip away. This is a big issue for the mining companies that rely on their workers for survival. The Fever comes about by the infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot, and exposure to these rays over time causes the Fever in humans. The good news is that the infra-red rays can be combated with ultra violet light, which we see Jimmy Baker and Xartal use at the end of the story, shining the light on the miners to counteract the exposure.  ",
                "Jimmy Baker believes he is losing his workers to onset Red Spot Fever, the symptoms of which include extreme talkativeness followed by a tendency to wander away and disappear. Following the discovery of the massive store of Acoustix around Shaft Four, his workers began wandering into the vastness of the Baldric. Billy and Ezra confirm Jimmy's suspicions when they discover a device hidden in the barracks at Larynx Incorporated that concentrates and amplifies the power of the infra-red rays from nearby Jupiter's great spot. The device operates on a timer so that it beams onto the workers as they sleep. Antlers Park admits to having installed the device because he feared the resultant competition from Jimmy Baker's discovery of the deep Acoustix vein. In order to combat the Red Spot Fever, Annie and Jimmy concoct a plan to utilize Jimmy's kite car as a makeshift beam from which to cast ultraviolet rays upon the wandering workers. Since the rays are at the opposite end of the vibratory scale, they can be used to subvert the symptoms of Red Spot Fever and draw the workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",
                "Red Spot Fever is an illness that Jimmy Baker's workers come down with after Antlers Park hatches a plan to make them sick. He or one of his minions sneaks into the workers' barracks and places a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The lens works to amplify Jupiter's infrared-rays, and the rays hit the men while they are sleeping. The workers are affected by this contraption because it makes them extremely talkative and forces them to walk out of their mines. Importantly, Billy looks through Jimmy Baker's folder of victims and makes a connection that the men are becoming sick while they are sleeping, and not while they are working. This gives Ezra and Billy the idea to go to the barracks and look around, and that's when they find the lens that amplifies the harmful rays. \n\nGrannie Annie is able to solve the problem by hitting the infected men with ultraviolet light which counteracts against the infrared-rays. When the men are no longer poisoned by the infrared, they walk right back to their work stations. "

However, he is never physically in any of these locations. Instead, he possesses people sleeping in these cities to write the letters for him in order to avoid detection.

The vibrational plane of the alien world extends just a tiny bit into Earth (referred to as the not-world by the aliens), and the fringe between the two allows for human psychics to intrude into the alien\u2019s realm, or for human seance practises to summon alien vibrations on Earth in ways that are terrifying for the aliens. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate these vibrational intrusions any longer and have embarked on a mission to destroy all life on Earth by having two of their own take the form of humans and develop a chemical weapon (a mold) to wipe them out.\nThe mission of Glmpauszn and Joe takes place on Earth between June 8th and September 25th of an unknown year. Glmpauszn mails letters from various international locations to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City by controlling the minds of unknown sleeping humans to pen what he spiritually dictates, and mail the letters without ever knowing they have done it. Glmpauszn\u2019s physical location is not explicitly discussed, but it is possibly nearby to New York City since he does not mention the need for any long-distance or international travel in his letters. Both Glmpauszn and Joe become distracted from their mission at times by drugs, alcohol, stealing money using their invisibility, and the sensations of experiencing human emotions like love.\nThe Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City is an especially important location in the story, because it is the final meeting place where Glmpauszn and Joe return to their vibrational realm through a mirror with a heavy bronze frame, leaving their clothes in heaps as if they had melted out of them, only the frame of the mirror, and the pile of letters from Glmpauszn to Joe that detail their entire mission on Earth.\n",

In between, the setting moves from place to place as Glmpauszn moves around, beginning in Bombay, India and moving to Wichita, Kansas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Moscow, Idaho; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; Penobscot, Maine; Sacramento, California; and Florence, Italy.

The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"",

Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END",

Tony Carmen held his pinkly manicured,\nflashily ringed hands wide.\n  \n \n  I saw his problem and it was warmly embarrassing.\n  \n \n  'Really, Mr. Carmen,' I said, 'this isn't the sort of thing you discuss\nwith a total stranger. I'm not a doctor\u2014not of medicine, anyway\u2014or a\nlawyer.'\n  \n \n  'They can't help me. I need an operator in your line.'\n  \n \n  'I work for the United States government.

'You can't, Professor\nVenetti? Ever hear of the Mafia?'\n  \n \n  'I've heard of it,' I said uneasily. 'An old fraternal organization\nsomething like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. It\nallegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is a\nresponsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stamping\nout.

I had heard too much and for too\nlong. All the stories I had ever heard about the Mafia, true or false,\nbuilt up an unendurable threat.\n  \n \n  'All right, I'll try to help you, Carmen. But ... that is, you didn't\nkill any of these people?'\n  \n \n  He snorted. 'I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.'\n  \n \n  'Please,' I said weakly. 'You needn't incriminate yourself with me.'\n  \n \n  'I was in the Marines,' Carmen said hotly. 'Listen, Professor, these\naren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these\ndays. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club\nhaven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims. Rumbums\nwith too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets\ngoing to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just\nstows them at my place to embarrass me.

'No. I don't suppose you could.'\n  \n \n  'I told you once, Professor, but I'll tell you again. I have to get rid\nof these bodies they keep leaving in my kitchen.

An\ninteresting problem, at that.'\n  \n \n  'I figured you could handle it,' Carmen said, leaning back comfortably\nin the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. 'I heard you were\nworking on something to get rid of trash for the government.'\n  \n \n  'That,' I told him, 'is restricted information. I subcontracted that\nwork from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?'\n  \n \n  'Ways, Professor, ways.'\n  \n \n  The government did want me to find a way to dispose of\nwastes\u2014radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the\nshadow of the Black Hand cooled it off.\n  \n \n  'Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,' I\nsaid. 'I'll call you.'\n  \n \n  'Don't take too long, Professor,' Carmen said cordially.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 403\nDocument 2 text: 'Well,' McGill said, 'nothing you've told me is impossible or\nsupernatural.

Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\n  \n \n  'Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at\nwhat I'm going to say.

Maybe we can have a\ndemonstration.'\n  \n \n  He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. 'Have you any\nchange on you?'\n  \n \n  'Why, yes,' I said. 'Quite a bit.' I reached into my pocket. There\nmust have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. 'Do you think\nthey'll each have the same date, perhaps?'\n  \n \n  'Did you accumulate all that change today?'\n  \n \n  'No. During the week.'\n  \n \n  He shook his head. 'In that case, no.

I'll\ntell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if\nthey all come up heads.'\n  \n \n  I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the\nfloor. They clattered and bounced\u2014and bounced together\u2014and stacked\nthemselves into a neat pile.\n  \n \n  I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a\nhandful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\n  \n \n  These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,\nthe adjacent ones touching.\n  \n \n  'Well,' I said, 'what more do you want?'\n  \n \n  'Great Scott,' he said, and sat down. 'I suppose you know that\nthere are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\nUniverse\u2014random and design.

'When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....'\n  \n \n  'Who?' I interrupted.\n  \n \n  'An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.'\n  \n \n  The old woman paused.

The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  'When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.'\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  'Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  'The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household.

The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!'\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, 'So what?'\n  \n \n  'So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  'Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material.

Now I didn't know what to call it.\n  \n \n  The AEC had found burying canisters of hot rubbish in the desert or\nin the Gulf had eventually proved unsatisfactory. Earth tremors or\nchanges of temperature split the tanks in the ground, causing leaks.\nThe undersea containers rusted and corroded through the time, poisoning\nfish and fishermen.\n  \n \n  Through the SBA I had been awarded a subcontract to work on the\nproblem. The ideal solution would be to find a way to neutralize\nradioactive emanations, alpha, beta, X et cetera. (No, my dear, et\ncetera rays aren't any more dangerous than the rest.) But this is\neasier written than done.\n  \n \n  Of course, getting energy to destroy energy without producing energy or\nmatter is a violation of the maxim of the conservation of energy.

You can't allow other people's ideas to tie you hand\nand foot.

To\nthis, I can only smile and nod.\n  \n \n  But even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, I failed.\n  \n \n  I could not neutralize radioactivity. All I had been able to do (by a\nbasic disturbance in the electromagnetogravitational co-ordinant system\nfor Earth-Sun) was to reduce the mass of the radioactive matter.\n  \n \n  This only concentrated the radiations, as in boiling contaminated\nwater. It did make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle, but it was\nno breakthrough on the central problem.\n  \n \n  Now, in the middle of this, I was supposed to find a way to get rid of\nsome damned bodies for Carmen.\n  \n \n  Pressed for time and knowing the results wouldn't have to be so\nprecise or carefully defined for a racketeer as for the United States\ngovernment, I began experimenting.\n  \n \n  I cut corners.\n  \n \n  I bypassed complete safety circuits.\n  \n \n  I put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the\nwiring diagrams. If I got some kind of passable incinerator I would be\nhappy.\n  \n \n  I turned the machine on.\n  \n \n  The lights popped out.\n  \n \n  There were changes that should be made before I tried that again, but\ninstead I only found a larger fuse for a heavier load and jammed that\nin the switchbox.\n  \n \n  I flipped my machine into service once again. The lights flickered and\nheld.\n  \n \n  The dials on my control board told me the story. It was hard to take.\n  \n \n  But there it was.\n  \n \n  The internal Scale showed zero.\n  \n \n  I had had a slightly hot bar of silver alloy inside. It was completely\ngone. Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been\nno change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained by the\nmechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no sudden\ndischarge of electricity or radioactivity. I checked for a standard\nanti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had\ngone to zero but never to minus.\n  \n \n  I was at last violating conservation of energy\u2014not by successfully\ninverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass ...\nby simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side\neffects.\n  \n \n  I knew the government wouldn't be interested, since I couldn't explain\nhow my device worked. No amount of successful demonstration could ever\nconvince anybody with any scientific training that it actually did work.\n  \n \n  But I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassing\n'how' when he was incapable of understanding the explanation.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\n  \n \n  As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\n  \n \n  The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n  \n \n  '... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,' she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. 'Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....'\n  \n \n  Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n  \n \n  '... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit\nsection lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged\nit into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored\nvehicle.\n  \n \n  'That's the model WV,' she said.

I assumed it was a Foundation\nship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  'Mister Cohn,' I said, chart in hand, 'do these figures look right to\nyou?'\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. 'The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,' he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  'Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,' I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  'You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,' I said, 'I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....' Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  'Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,' I read, 'Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....' I looked up and closed the book. 'Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.'\n  \n \n  'Unless it already belongs to someone?' asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  'That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,' I replied quietly. 'My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....'\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. 'You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?'\n  \n \n  'Maybe even from beyond the stars,' Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, 'Do we look her over, Captain?'\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  'Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,' I said sharply.\n'Certainly!'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n  \n \n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  'There! How do you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?'\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n  \n \n  'Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!'\n  \n \n  'You,' Chip told him serenely, 'have no appreciation of beauty. What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think of it, Padre?'\n  \n \n  'Salvation' Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black,\na lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his\nweathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. 'Well,\nmy boy,' he admitted, 'there is\n   \n   some\n   \n  Biblical precedent for\nyour\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat\nwhich was of many colors\u2014''\n  \n \n  'Both of you,' declared Chip, 'give me a pain in the pants!\nStick-in-the-muds!

But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014'\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of 'turning the other cheek' to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. 'I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?'\n  \n \n  'No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.'\n  \n \n  'O.Q. I'm off alone, then.

A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  'Sometimes,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'It has other names?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It has no name,' Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  'Yet you call it Earth?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I do,' Korvin said, 'for convenience.'\n  \n \n  'Do you know its location?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'Not with exactitude,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. 'But you can find it again,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I can,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'And you will tell us about it?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will,' Korvin said, 'so far as I am able.'\n  \n \n  'We will wish to know about weapons,' the Ruler said, 'and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. 'Both,' he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. 'We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?'\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. 'It is,' he said.\n  \n \n  'Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,'\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'It is,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Who is it that governs?' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  'The answer to that question,' Korvin said, 'cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  'Any question of fact has an answer,' the Ruler snapped. 'A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?'\n  \n \n  'Certainly,' Korvin said. 'It is completely obvious and true.'\n  \n \n  'The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor for this system,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. 'Explain this governor to us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'The explanation cannot be given to you.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. 'Is the deficiency in you?' he said. 'Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?'\n  \n \n  'It can be described,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?' the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  'I will not,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. 'You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,' he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. 'I am attempting,' he said, 'not to\nconfuse you.'\n  \n \n  'Then I ask for an answer,' the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  'I request that I be allowed to ask a question,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. 'Ask it,' he said. 'We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.'\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. 'Well, then,' he said, 'what is your\ngovernment?'\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. 'Our government is the only logical form of government,' he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. 'The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.'\n  \n \n  'You have heard our government defined,' the Ruler said. 'Now, you\nwill define yours for us.'\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. 'If you insist,' he said, 'I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.'\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. 'We shall understand,' he said. 'Begin. Who governs\nyou?'\n  \n \n  'None,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'But you are governed?'\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. 'Yes.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is a governor,' the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  'True,' Korvin said. 'But everyone is the governor.'\n  \n \n  'Then there is no government,' the Ruler said. 'There is no single\ndecision.'\n  \n \n  'No,' Korvin said equably, 'there are many decisions binding on all.'\n  \n \n  'Who makes them binding?' the Ruler asked. 'Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?'\n  \n \n  'Many of them are unfavorable,' Korvin said. 'But we are not forced to\naccept them.'\n  \n \n  'Do you act against your own interests?'\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. 'Not knowingly,' he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. 'I told you you wouldn't understand it,' he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  'It is a defect in your explanation,' the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  'My explanation is as exact as it can be,' he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. 'Let us try something else,' he said.\n'Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Neither have we,' Korvin said. 'We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.'\n  \n \n  'But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014'\n  \n \n  'We have no need of one,' Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  'Ah,' the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. 'And why\nnot?'\n  \n \n  'We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,' Korvin said. 'It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.'\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. 'The beings themselves rule each\nother?' he said. 'This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.'\n  \n \n  'That is our form of government,' Korvin said.\n  \n \n  'You are lying,' the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: 'The machine tells us\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Then the machine is faulty,' the expert said. 'It will be corrected.'\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  \"All right!\"\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor.

Now I didn't know what to call it.\n  \n \n  The AEC had found burying canisters of hot rubbish in the desert or\nin the Gulf had eventually proved unsatisfactory. Earth tremors or\nchanges of temperature split the tanks in the ground, causing leaks.\nThe undersea containers rusted and corroded through the time, poisoning\nfish and fishermen.\n  \n \n  Through the SBA I had been awarded a subcontract to work on the\nproblem. The ideal solution would be to find a way to neutralize\nradioactive emanations, alpha, beta, X et cetera. (No, my dear, et\ncetera rays aren't any more dangerous than the rest.) But this is\neasier written than done.\n  \n \n  Of course, getting energy to destroy energy without producing energy or\nmatter is a violation of the maxim of the conservation of energy. But\nI didn't let that stop me\u2014any more than I would have let the velocity\nof light put any limitations on a spacecraft engine had I been engaged\nto work on one. You can't allow other people's ideas to tie you hand\nand foot. There are some who tell me, however, that my refusal to honor\nsuch time-tested cliches is why I only have a small private laboratory\nowned by myself, my late wife's father and the bank, instead of\nworking in the vast facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or General Motors. To\nthis, I can only smile and nod.\n  \n \n  But even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, I failed.\n  \n \n  I could not neutralize radioactivity. All I had been able to do (by a\nbasic disturbance in the electromagnetogravitational co-ordinant system\nfor Earth-Sun) was to reduce the mass of the radioactive matter.\n  \n \n  This only concentrated the radiations, as in boiling contaminated\nwater. It did make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle, but it was\nno breakthrough on the central problem.\n  \n \n  Now, in the middle of this, I was supposed to find a way to get rid of\nsome damned bodies for Carmen.\n  \n \n  Pressed for time and knowing the results wouldn't have to be so\nprecise or carefully defined for a racketeer as for the United States\ngovernment, I began experimenting.\n  \n \n  I cut corners.\n  \n \n  I bypassed complete safety circuits.\n  \n \n  I put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the\nwiring diagrams. If I got some kind of passable incinerator I would be\nhappy.\n  \n \n  I turned the machine on.\n  \n \n  The lights popped out.\n  \n \n  There were changes that should be made before I tried that again, but\ninstead I only found a larger fuse for a heavier load and jammed that\nin the switchbox.\n  \n \n  I flipped my machine into service once again. The lights flickered and\nheld.\n  \n \n  The dials on my control board told me the story. It was hard to take.\n  \n \n  But there it was.\n  \n \n  The internal Scale showed zero.\n  \n \n  I had had a slightly hot bar of silver alloy inside. It was completely\ngone. Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been\nno change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained by the\nmechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no sudden\ndischarge of electricity or radioactivity. I checked for a standard\nanti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had\ngone to zero but never to minus.\n  \n \n  I was at last violating conservation of energy\u2014not by successfully\ninverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass ...\nby simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side\neffects.\n  \n \n  I knew the government wouldn't be interested, since I couldn't explain\nhow my device worked. No amount of successful demonstration could ever\nconvince anybody with any scientific training that it actually did work.\n  \n \n  But I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassing\n\"how\" when he was incapable of understanding the explanation.",

The principal difficulty was that,\nbecause of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from\novershooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at\nhim\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both\nsides, too.\n  \n \n  Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no\nmatter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he\nwasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand\nsegregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic\nthought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars\nwere often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since\nmetal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the\nplanet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the\neasy way out.\n  \n \n  Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high\npriest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were\nvolcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the\nwind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the\nsnug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were\nmetal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\n  \n \n  As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\n  \n \n  The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n  \n \n  \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....\"\n  \n \n  Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n  \n \n  \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.\"",

The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"",

BOND\n  \n \n  Far out in limitless Space she plied\n   \n  her deadly trade ... a Lorelei of the\n   \n  void, beckoning spacemen to death and\n   \n  destruction with her beautiful siren lure.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1941.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Chip Warren stood before an oblong of glass set into one wall of\nthe spaceship\n   \n   Chickadee II\n   \n  , stared at what he saw reflected\ntherefrom\u2014and frowned. He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n  \n \n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"There! How do you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n  \n \n  \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty. What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think of it, Padre?\"\n  \n \n  \"Salvation\" Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black,\na lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his\nweathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. \"Well,\nmy boy,\" he admitted, \"there is\n   \n   some\n   \n  Biblical precedent for\nyour\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat\nwhich was of many colors\u2014'\"\n  \n \n  \"Both of you,\" declared Chip, \"give me a pain in the pants!\nStick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first time in months,\ncargo-bins loaded to the gunwales with enough ekalastron to make us\nrich for life\u2014and you sit here like a pair of stuffed owls!\n  \n \n  \"Well, not me! I'm going to take a night off, throw myself a party the\nlikes of which was never seen around these parts. Put a candle in the\nwindow, chilluns, 'cause li'l' Chip won't be home till the wee, sma'\nhours!\"\n  \n \n  Syd chuckled.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q., big shot. But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n  \n \n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n  \n \n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. I'm off alone, then. See you later!\"\n  \n \n  And, whistling, Chip Warren stepped through the lock of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  onto the soil of the asteroid Danae.",

Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END",

The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"",

With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it.

Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END",

The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n  \n \n  From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n  \n \n  The law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n  \n \n  But everybody knew that if you\n   \n   really\n   \n  wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black\nmarket prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be\ndone.\n  \n \n  Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got\nlost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with\na black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse\noff lower Broadway.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth. We've been expecting\nyou.\"\n\ndocument 2: I didn't realize it was a derelict when Spinelli first reported\nit from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation\nship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"\n\ndocument 3: \"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked.

Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n\n# plan: The response should include examples of government regulations that are relevant to the themes of personal identity, memory, and change in the story, and how these regulations impact the character's struggle and the backdrop of societal rules.\n# important information: Government regulations, personal identity, memory, changes in life, societal rules, and their impact on the character.\n\nYou should strirctly follow the instructions below to generate a response to the question in a valid JSON format without any additional text or explanation.\n"

The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"",

Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor.

At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END",

                    "generated_output": "In the story, government regulations play a significant role in the character's struggle with his memories and the changes in his life. For instance, the Federal control and laws regulating the use of Primes (artificial intelligences) are rigid and strict, with licenses and inspections required. This backdrop of societal rules impacts the character's personal identity and memory, as he must navigate the limitations imposed by these regulations. Additionally, the Space Regulations of the Holcomb Foundation, which govern the handling of derelicts and salvage, highlight the importance of following established rules. These regulations create a framework within which the character must operate, making it difficult to fully embrace his memories and personal identity. The character's struggle is further complicated by the lack of a clear government structure, as seen in the conversation between Korvin and the Ruler, where the concept of a single governing entity is challenged. This absence of a clear authority adds to the character's confusion and the overall sense of change in his life.",

                        "One of the government restrictions that Edna reminds Harry about is the rationing of meat. Due to the crisis in the country, there is a shortage of meat. Instead of actual meat, most people eat multi-pro, which is similar to spam. The government also sets up boundaries for the residents to stay inside of, and they are not allowed to go past these regulations or else the police will come. The government also takes care of supplies, and most residents just have to write down what they want and pay a bill. In terms of money, the government takes care of it as well each week. Each farm receives the same number of animals because government agents paid flat rates. When Harry finds the stock of grain, he notes that the government has enough to keep going for a few years. Television is also restricted to old movies, playing only on one channel from nine to eleven at night. Later, it is revealed that these restrictions are imposed to keep the people alive on the ark long enough until they can begin to expand civilization again. ",
                        "Some of the government regulations included rationing the food. This included not being able to butcher their own meat,  but rather, having multi-pro. There was also a regulation about the type of farming allowed. Despite all the land, the government would pay the farmers for letting the fields remain empty as long as they only farm vegetables, and not wheat or corn. \n\nAdditionally, there are regulations on travel and gas. You were not able to go further than your neighbor's house. There is also an education regulation that says children should be at least 5 years and 9 months old before beginning to learn and read through a kindergarten book. ",
                        "The travel regulation restricts the area that people can travel to, which means their own houses and the closest neighbor's house. Whoever breaks the travel regulation will be sent to see the doctor. People buy their living necessities through delivery weekly by the rationing regulation. The farming regulations prohibit the plantation of wheat and corn, only allowing vegetables to be grown, resulting in many fields fallow. People would get compensated by the government for not planting wheat or corn. The rationing regulation allocates foods and living necessities for each family, regulates the supplies people can get, and prohibits people from butchering their livestock. Everyone has the same amount of livestock. Gas and water are also rationed that each family can only have a sink of water for dishes each day and a tub of bath water twice a week. The television regulation limits the channel to one, restricts the watching time to only nine to eleven at night, and constrains the audience to watch the listed movies only. Emergency Education Regulations claim that children should be at least five years nine months old to learn kindergarten books.",
                        "They cannot cultivate wheat and corn, and these fields are not in use. There are meat rations that significantly limit the amount of meat one household can consume. Harry also thinks about the travel regulations - he can't go further than Walt and Gloria Shanks' place. They live a little more than a mile away from Harry and Edna. There is gas rationing. The livestock is controlled by the government, too -  every household has the same number of chickens, sheep, cows, etc. We learn about the Emergency Education Regulations - every child should be five years nine months old before embarking on a kindergarten book.

The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"",

But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END",

Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture.

The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws.

She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.",

After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"",

It\nexpressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\nneurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\nwas something implacable about his sighs.\n  \n \n  \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\nwith a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\nthe widow's next door and then the library.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\nsaid. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\n  \n \n  Lanfierre nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\n  \n \n  \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\nwatching the house with a consuming interest.\n  \n \n  They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\nwidened as the house danced a new step.",

His eyes rolled as he added, 'A lady!'\n  \n \n  A woman here...! The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. 'Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.'\n  \n \n  'Hi, Billy-boy,' she greeted calmly. 'Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.'\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white.

Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?'\n  \n \n  'Hold it, Billy-boy.' Laughingly she threw up both hands. 'Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.'\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  'What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?'

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\nlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\nturned.\n  \n \n  'Everything shipshape, I take it!' he commented.\n  \n \n  The OD nodded. 'I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,' he said.\n'Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\nready to lift as soon as they come back.'\n  \n \n  The Exec tossed away his cigarette.

Lord, they don't\neven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.'\n  \n \n  'Acclimation,' Lowry said scientifically. 'They had to acclimate\nthemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.'\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n  \n \n  'Of course,' Lowry said suddenly, 'there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable.

Sure\nenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. He\nsnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n'Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!' But\neven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\nand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n  \n \n  The Executive Officer nodded gloomily.

He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food.

This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word 'Cai', and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n'Kai'\u2014or 'Kay'. Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word 'fiance,' and the word\n'fiance' brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., 'marriage'. Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food.

We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.'\n  \n \n  'I'm not sure I can,' he answered reluctantly. 'My hazard pay doesn't\ncover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.'\n  \n \n  I clapped him on the shoulder. 'But, man, you have just been telling\nme all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your\nexperience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such\nfamiliar conditions\u2014right?'\n  \n \n  'Yes, sir, I suppose I could,' Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost\nout somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli!

The fire was back home. And here in the cold of this\nfog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble,\nthe diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His\ncherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the\ndiaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from\na string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood\nirresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more\nfamiliar bedlam.\n  \n \n  But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was,\nthough she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger,\nthirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his\nfriends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were\nthings of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring\neyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide.\n  \n \n  Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite\ncomplete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light\non the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off,\nan owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and\nrustle as they scampered.\n  \n \n  The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as\nan irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even\nin the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the\nOne who'd built him must have been an apprentice.\n  \n \n  For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now\nwalked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of\nhow much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock\nitself a difference to be hidden.\n  \n \n  His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A\nweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was\nthe levering key that opened its door.\n  \n \n \n   Everything\n   \n  was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of\ncourse that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to\nmove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for\nventilation.\n  \n \n  But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry\nout every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all\nobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against\neverything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even\n   \n   him\n   \n  out\nwhen he was aflame....\n  \n \n  Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling.\nHe lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the\nstreet, and felt with his feet for the top rung.\n  \n \n  Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but\nsaw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could\nhave entered through the iron cover?\n  \n \n  He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.\n  \n \n  It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body\nheat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information.

His eyes rolled as he added, 'A lady!'\n  \n \n  A woman here...! The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. 'Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.'\n  \n \n  'Hi, Billy-boy,' she greeted calmly. 'Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.'\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. 'Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....'\n  \n \n  'Okay, okay,' I grinned. 'Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.'\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  'What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?'\n  \n \n  'Hold it, Billy-boy.' Laughingly she threw up both hands. 'Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.'\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  'What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?'

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 110\nDocument 2 text: Raiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world\u2014to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  'New York,' he said, 'good ol' New York.'\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  'Tako, woman,' he greeted her.\n  \n \n  'Tako,' she replied fearfully. 'Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?'\n  \n \n  'A friend,' said Noork simply. 'It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.'\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  'Your hair is the color of the sun!' she said. 'Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.' Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. 'Who are you?'\n  \n \n  'I am Noork,' the man told her. 'For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.'\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. 'Gurn!' she cried. 'Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?'\n  \n \n  'That is Gurn,' admitted Noork shortly. 'He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?'\n  \n \n  'Indeed I do,' cried Sarna. 'My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.'\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. 'I am glad he is your brother,' he said simply.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu\nDayol fot ig habe mot toseo knwo\u2014te bijk weil en snoll doper\u2014Klio,\nasdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\n   \n \n \n  Since when, Quidley wondered, refolding the paper and putting it back\nin the book, had high-school typing students taken to reading Taine?\nThoughtfully he replaced the book on the shelf and moved deeper into\nthe literature section.\n  \n \n  He had just taken down Xenophon's\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  when he saw the girl walk\nin the door.\n  \n \n  Let it be said forthwith that old books were not the only item on\nHerbert Quidley's penchant-list. He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word 'Cai', and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n'Kai'\u2014or 'Kay'. Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word 'fiance,' and the word\n'fiance' brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., 'marriage'. Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 772\nDocument 2 text: When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a\nchild, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid\nof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\nat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\nown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n  \n \n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n  \n \n  If the words 'Let's see a movie' were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words 'Let's roll this guy' were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\nmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\nto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\nsomeone's pocket at forty yards.\n  \n \n  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\nstore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\nof business for years.\n  \n \n  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devices\nplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\nheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\nmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\npoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\nof it would kill a human.\n  \n \n  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\nsupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\nof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\npointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\nof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\nthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n  \n \n  And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\nof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\nthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\ndifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\ntheir aim was infallible.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

As a man, he wasn't afraid\nof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\nat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\nown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n  \n \n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n  \n \n  If the words 'Let's see a movie' were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words 'Let's roll this guy' were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\nmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\nto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\nsomeone's pocket at forty yards.\n  \n \n  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\nstore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\nof business for years.\n  \n \n  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devices\nplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\nheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\nmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\npoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\nof it would kill a human.\n  \n \n  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\nsupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\nof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\npointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\nof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\nthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n  \n \n  And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\nof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\nthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\ndifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\ntheir aim was infallible.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg.

He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food.

Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four.

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.",

The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli!

Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n  \n \n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society.

YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\".

Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me\n   \n   you're\n   \n  from another time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway.

Look at\nyourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that\nkind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked\nbefore. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about\neverything else, even your own life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration\nService, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my\nhazard pay, I get more hard cash than\n   \n   you\n   \n  do, and I'm closer to\nretirement.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,\nwith a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn\nto know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary\ncaution the service likes in officers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was\na lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got\ntoo cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my\ncontemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an\noutsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more\nthan a figurehead.\"\n  \n \n  Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately\ninsulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the\nfamiliarity that had always existed between members of a crew working\nunder close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the\nfirst orbital ships.\n  \n \n  \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us\nis right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n  \n \n  \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't\ncover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling\nme all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your\nexperience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such\nfamiliar conditions\u2014right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost\nout somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend.",

The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli!

Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the\nbook back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n  \n \n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society.

By the time the door chimes sounded he was his\nnormal self again.\n  \n \n  He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his\nshirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and\nlooked around the room to see if everything was in place.

And here in the cold of this\nfog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble,\nthe diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His\ncherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the\ndiaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from\na string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood\nirresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more\nfamiliar bedlam.\n  \n \n  But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was,\nthough she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger,\nthirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his\nfriends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were\nthings of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring\neyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide.\n  \n \n  Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite\ncomplete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light\non the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off,\nan owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and\nrustle as they scampered.\n  \n \n  The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as\nan irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even\nin the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the\nOne who'd built him must have been an apprentice.\n  \n \n  For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now\nwalked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of\nhow much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock\nitself a difference to be hidden.\n  \n \n  His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A\nweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was\nthe levering key that opened its door.\n  \n \n \n   Everything\n   \n  was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of\ncourse that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to\nmove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for\nventilation.\n  \n \n  But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry\nout every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all\nobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against\neverything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even\n   \n   him\n   \n  out\nwhen he was aflame....\n  \n \n  Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling.\nHe lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the\nstreet, and felt with his feet for the top rung.\n  \n \n  Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but\nsaw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could\nhave entered through the iron cover?\n  \n \n  He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.\n  \n \n  It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body\nheat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!",

Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food.

At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.",

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.",

Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.",

He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n  \n \n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n  \n \n  If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes.

As a man, he wasn't afraid\nof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\nat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\nown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n  \n \n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n  \n \n  If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\nmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\nto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\nsomeone's pocket at forty yards.\n  \n \n  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\nstore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\nof business for years.\n  \n \n  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devices\nplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\nheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\nmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\npoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\nof it would kill a human.\n  \n \n  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\nsupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\nof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\npointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\nof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\nthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n  \n \n  And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\nof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\nthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\ndifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\ntheir aim was infallible.",

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie!

Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.",

Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\ndocument 4: Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading\ntable, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine,\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route\nto the shelf where Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  reposed, take the volume down,\nsurreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages\nand return it to the shelf.\n  \n \n  After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second\nmessage. It was as unintelligible as the first:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe\nwotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te. T'lide sid Fieu Dayol po jestig\ntoseo knwo, bijk weil en snoll doper entling\u2014Yoolna. asdf ;lkj asdf\n;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\n   \n \n \n  Well, perhaps not quite as unintelligible. He knew, at least, who Cai\nwas, and he knew\u2014from the reappearance of the words\n   \n   wotnid\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Fieu\nDayol\n   \n  and\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  \u2014that the two communications were in the\nsame code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last\nword\u2014\n   \n   Yoolna\n   \n  \u2014was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that\nshe was a different person from the\n   \n   Klio\n   \n  whose name had appended the\nfirst message.\n  \n \n  He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book\nto the shelf and went back to the reading table and\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning\nto think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till\ntomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"\n\ndocument 5: Lieutenant MacBride pursed his lips.\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you something else,\" Lanfierre went on. \"The\n   \n   windows\n   \n  all\nclose at the same time. You'll be watching and all of a sudden every\nsingle window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned\nback in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think\nthere's a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal\u2014as if\nthey all had something important to say but had to close the windows\nfirst so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city?\nAnd then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into\nconversation\u2014and that's why the house shakes.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride whistled.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't need a vacation.\"\n  \n \n  A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the\nwindshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\n  \n \n  \"No, you don't need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You're starting to see\nflying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You've got winds in your\nbrain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality\u2014\"\n  \n \n  At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed\nshut.\n  \n \n  The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound.\nMacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the\nghostly babble of voices to commence.\n  \n \n  The house began to shake.\n  \n \n  It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and\ndipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The\nhouse could have been preparing to take off and sail down the....\n  \n \n  MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then\nthey both looked back at the dancing house.\n  \n \n  \"And the\n   \n   water\n   \n  ,\" Lanfierre said. \"The\n   \n   water\n   \n  he uses! He could be\nthe thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole\nfamily of thirsty and clean kids, and he\n   \n   still\n   \n  wouldn't need all that\nwater.\"\n  \n \n  The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages\nnow in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did\nyou see what he carries in his pockets?\"\n  \n \n  \"And compasses won't work on this street.\"\n  \n \n  The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\n  \n \n  He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It\nexpressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\nneurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\nwas something implacable about his sighs.\n  \n \n  \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\nwith a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\nthe widow's next door and then the library.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\nsaid. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\n  \n \n  Lanfierre nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\n  \n \n  \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\nwatching the house with a consuming interest.\n  \n \n  They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\nwidened as the house danced a new step.\n\n# plan: Based on the gathered information, the setting of the story is a library.

A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.",

It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"",

I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"",

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.",

She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"",

There\nwas something implacable about his sighs.\n  \n \n  \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\nwith a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same.

Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n  \n \n  \"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n  \n \n  \"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n  \n \n  \"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n  \n \n  \"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\n  \n \n  Rat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n  \n \n  \"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  Rat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\n  \n \n  Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\n   \n   last\n   \n  night ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\n  \n \n  Rat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n  \n \n  \"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you?\"\n  \n \n  \"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n  \n \n  \"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n  \n \n  \"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\n  \n \n  Gray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n  \n \n  \"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n  \n \n  \"Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty, Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n  \n \n  \"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\n  \n \n  Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n  \n \n  \"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\n  \n \n  He faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"",

Damn you Rat, listen to me!\n   \n   When're you going to start braking\n   \n  ,\nRat?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Not brake?\n   \n  \" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n  \n \n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  \"Earth!\" she shouted.\n  \n \n  \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just name it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\n  \n \n  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  \"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.",

The user provides you with a question and some information and suggestions about what aspect to search for. Your goal is to help the user find information that can help them answer the question. This is a multi-turn action. In this action, first, you need to provide a search query that will help you find relevant information to accurately answer the question. Note that search does not provide a direct answer to the question and should be used to gather useful information. In response, the user will provide you with information about the search results. Then, in the second turn, you need to analyze the provided information to verify the accuracy and relevance of the information. In response, the user will provide you with confirmation about the accuracy and relevance of the information. This continues until you no longer need more information and the provided information is sufficient and useful.\n\n# Step 1: \n## your input: The user provides you with the following information:\n    - \"question\": the question the user wants to answer.\n    - \"information\": a summary of the information the user has gathered so far. This can be empty if the user has not gathered any information yet.\n    - \"suggestions\": a set of suggestions about what aspect to search for.\n## your output: you need to provide a JSON object enclosed in ```json ``` that contains the following fields:\n    - \"search_query\": the search query you suggest to find information that can help in answering the user's question.\n    - \"search_query_explanation\": an explanation of why you suggest this search query.\n    \n# Step 2:\n## your input: The user provides you with the search results.\n    - \"search_results\": the search results using the query that you suggested.\n## your output: you need to provide a JSON object enclosed in ```json ``` that contains the following fields:\n    - \"query_id\": the query ID of the search result.\n    - \"relevance\": a valid json list that each object in the list contains the following fields:\n        - \"doc_id\": The document ID of the search result that you want to verify.\n        - \"is_relevant\": a boolean value indicating whether the document is relevant to the query and contains useful information for collecting the information that can help answer the question.\n        - \"is_relevant_explanation\": an explanation of why the document is relevant or not relevant.\n    - \"change_search_query\": a boolean value indicating whether you think we need to change the search query to find relevant information that can help answer the question. This is helpful when after multiple retrieval results from the same query is given to you and you couldn't find the relevant information. By setting this to true, you suggest a new search query to find relevant information. If you need to use the same query again, you can set this to false.\n    - \"change_search_query_explanation\": an explanation of why you need to change the search query.\n    - \"new_search_query\": the new search query you suggest to find relevant information that can help answer the question. This is only needed if you set \"change_search_query\" to true. Otherwise, you can leave this field empty.\n    - \"end_search\": a boolean that show that you are satisfied with the search results and you don't need to search anymore. This is helpful when you think you have found enough information and you don't need to search anymore. By setting this to true, you suggest to end the search. If you need to continue searching, you can set this to false. This should be false if you set \"change_search_query\" to true.\n    - \"end_search_explanation\": an explanation of why you need to end the search.\n\n\nThis is a multi-turn action.

Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. 'He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!'\n  \n \n  'He has a good point there, Rat,' she spoke up. 'What about this\nhalf-way line?'\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. 'We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.' A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  'Passed!' Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  'You catch on quick,' Rat nodded. 'This six day, don't you know?'\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n'Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?'\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  'But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014'\n  \n \n  '\u2014he on Mars.

This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!'\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. 'Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before.

'The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !' He laughed with real satisfaction. 'Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.' And then he added: 'If we land.'\n  \n \n  'Oh, we land.' Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  'Yeah,' Gladney grated. 'But in how many little pieces?'\n  \n \n  'I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.' Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  'Earth!' she shouted.\n  \n \n  'Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?'\n  \n \n  'Just name it!'\n  \n \n  'Not drink long time. Some water?'\n  \n \n  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  'There isn't any left, Rat.'\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. 'Tasted punk,' he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  'Rat,' she said presently, 'I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?'\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. 'No. Who tell Rat?'\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. 'Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.'\n  \n \n  'But why didn't you explain?'\n  \n \n  He grinned again. 'Who believe? Sick man die soon after.'\n  \n \n  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. 'You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.'\n  \n \n  'They can't!' cried Patti Gray. 'They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.'\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  'Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.'\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: 'Say, I get it ... you're\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Shut up!' Rat cut him off sharply. 'You talk too much.' He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n  \n \n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014he on Mars.

No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  \"Earth!\" she shouted.\n  \n \n  \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just name it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Not drink long time.

Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe?

No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.",

The nurse is interested in his background and asks Roberds and Peterson. After learning about him leaving the post she wonders why he wasn't executed and feel sympathy for Rat. She visits him in secret to ask to pilot the ship, because her and the sick girl need to get to Earth as fast as possible and believe he can help. Rat does everything in a fast and well-organized way and plans to reach Earth in six days without brakes. He instructs Patti to cover herself in blankets not to get too hot and decides how the water will be distributed. He also tells about trying to save a man being the reason for him leaving the post and Patti feels even more sympathy. Nevertheless, during the journey they have a fight when she starts panicking and demanding water and Rat beats her. He tries to enforce his rules on the ship and others ask him to brake, Patti hurts herself during Rat's manoeuvres between the meteorites but she stands it. ",
                        "Rat and Patti Gray first meet when Rat is being yelled at by Roberds. They exchange short glances and small smiles during this initial meeting. Patti asks for Rat\u2019s help to get to Earth quicker instead of waiting for Roberds to take them. Rat agrees to help them readily accepts the request, quickly putting into action an escape plan. When Patti wakes up on the ship after the abrupt take off, she and Rat have a friendly conversation. Rat continuously smiles throughout the conversation and appears to be very friendly and happy to help Judith. ",
                        "Patti Gray is initially curious about Rat, prompting her to ask Roberds about his past. Once she asks Rat to pilot the ship, she is hesitant of him as a pilot. The two of them eventually converse once the ship takes off. They discuss the illness that Gladney and Judith are suffering from. She is curious about Rat's name, but he does not tell her because it is too long. He is also helpful, instructing Gray to keep the wool blanket on to preserve body heat and keep out the cold. Even when she swings a boot at him, he takes her to the water faucet and explains why the water is so hot. However, despite being helpful, Rat is quite rough towards Gray too. When she rolls along the deck and has a breakdown about not being able to keep up, he throws a handful of water into her face. He then kicks her to get up too. When he points out Earth to them, she is extremely grateful towards him for getting them to the planet so fast. Rat and Patti Gray do not share a very personal relationship. However, she learns more about him throughout their trip, and the two of them support each other in their own ways. \n",
                        "Patti Gray is wary of Rat and his history. She first asks Roberds and the Chief about Rat's name, and learns the story of Rat and his betrayal during the Sansan massacre. Despite being aware of this, Patti still reaches out to Rat and asks him to pilot the ship to Earth, at the request of Judith. Patti, being unknowledgeable of piloting ships, must listen to Rat's orders reluctantly. However, she still asks him about his life and eventually his side of the story at the massacre. Patti Gray becomes increasingly frustrated with Rat due to the conditions on the ship, particularly with the water supply. She maintains a respectful relationship with Rat despite her suspicions remaining."

Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n  \n \n  \"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n  \n \n  \"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n  \n \n  \"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n  \n \n  \"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\n  \n \n  Rat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n  \n \n  \"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  Rat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\n  \n \n  Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\n   \n   last\n   \n  night ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\n  \n \n  Rat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n  \n \n  \"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you?\"\n  \n \n  \"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n  \n \n  \"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n  \n \n  \"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\n  \n \n  Gray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n  \n \n  \"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n  \n \n  \"Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty, Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n  \n \n  \"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\n  \n \n  Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n  \n \n  \"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\n  \n \n  He faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel.

This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before.

Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed.

She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  \"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe?

The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.\"",

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"",

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"",

His statement, 'I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe that's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and that I had to kill him, so I did,' highlights the individual struggles and the impact of the challenges on the crew's mental state. The crew's collective and individual reactions are grounded in the challenges they face and the uncertainty of what they will find upon their return.",

Svan was the leader making the final\n   \n  plans\u2014plotting them a bit too well.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock.\nThere was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning\nperfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the\nsame. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\nlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\nturned.\n  \n \n  'Everything shipshape, I take it!' he commented.\n  \n \n  The OD nodded. 'I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,' he said.\n'Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\nready to lift as soon as they come back.'\n  \n \n  The Exec tossed away his cigarette. '\n   \n   If\n   \n  they come back.'\n  \n \n  'Is there any question?'\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged. 'I don't know, Lowry,' he said. 'This is a funny\nplace. I don't trust the natives.'\n  \n \n  Lowry lifted his eyebrows. 'Oh? But after all, they're human beings,\njust like us\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't\neven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.'\n  \n \n  'Acclimation,' Lowry said scientifically. 'They had to acclimate\nthemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.'\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n  \n \n  'Of course,' Lowry said suddenly, 'there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground\ngroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\nnative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, that\nis\u2014right down into the mud. Well\u2014' he laughed\u2014'maybe they will.\nAfter all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of\u2014'\n  \n \n  The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\nvoice rasped: 'Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\nreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!'\n  \n \n  Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\nstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\nenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. He\nsnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n'Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!' But\neven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\nand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n  \n \n  The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, 'You see!'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 528\nDocument 2 text: Knof Llud, the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, 'We've\nsighted Earth.'\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n'It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.'\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, 'How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?'\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. 'I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.' She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, 'What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.'\n  \n \n  'That's just it,' said Lesra shakily. 'Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....'\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. 'Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.' But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. 'I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.'\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, 'Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.'\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. 'Uh, Captain,' he said\nhesitantly. 'What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?'\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. 'Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  'One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  'Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  'Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  'It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....'\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  'One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  'We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  'It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  'Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  'Hopeless, unless we find planets!'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 528\nDocument 2 text: Knof Llud, the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, 'We've\nsighted Earth.'\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n'It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.'\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, 'How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?'\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. 'I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.' She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, 'What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.'\n  \n \n  'That's just it,' said Lesra shakily. 'Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....'\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. 'Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.' But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. 'I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.'\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, 'Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.'\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. 'Uh, Captain,' he said\nhesitantly. 'What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?'\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. 'Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth.

'Ghosts, Bruce?'\n  \n \n  'Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?'\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  'We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,' Bruce\npointed out. 'Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014'\n  \n \n  'The mountain,' Terrence said. 'You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.'\n  \n \n  'Not afraid,' Bruce objected. 'I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  'Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.'\n  \n \n  'Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!' Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  'I know,' Bruce said. 'Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014'\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. 'Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.'\n  \n \n  'What? Explain that remark.'\n  \n \n  'That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.'\n  \n \n  'Is that all, Bruce?'\n  \n \n  'That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.'\n  \n \n  'That's what I figured.' Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. 'Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.'\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n'Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.'\n  \n \n  'Yes,' Terrence said. 'But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014'\n  \n \n  'Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.' He glanced at Marsha. 'Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?'\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. 'Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014'\n  \n \n  'All right,' Terrence interrupted. 'Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?'\n  \n \n  'Yes. Execution.'\n  \n \n  'No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.'\n  \n \n  'I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.'\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. 'However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.'\n  \n \n  'What kind of service?'\n  \n \n  'Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.'\n  \n \n  'Why not?' Bruce said. 'You aren't certain you're coming back, then?'\n  \n \n  'We might not,' Terrence admitted calmly. 'Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.'\n  \n \n  'I'll do that,' Bruce said. 'It should be interesting.'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication.

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  'One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  'Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  'Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  'It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....'\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  'One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  'We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  'It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  'Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  'Hopeless, unless we find planets!'\n\nDocumnet 2 ID: 528\nDocument 2 text: Knof Llud, the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, 'We've\nsighted Earth.'\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n'It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.'\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, 'How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?'\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. 'I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.' She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, 'What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.'\n  \n \n  'That's just it,' said Lesra shakily. 'Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....'\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. 'Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.' But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. 'I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.'\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, 'Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.'\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. 'Uh, Captain,' he said\nhesitantly. 'What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?'\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. 'Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.'\n\n\nNow I need you to verify the information. Be as objective as possible in your verfication. Note you should strictly follow the given format and do not add any extra explanation or information to your output.\n"

The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs.

The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters.

He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary.

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"",

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"",

The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens.

That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start.

Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"",

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"",

I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n\ndocument 3: He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n\n# plan: The crew's feelings are influenced by the challenges they face as they approach Earth.

The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.\"",

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you.

I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams.

There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"",

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"",

When they hear that Earth has been spotted, they begin their exciting chatter again. They embraced each other, shouted, kissed, and wept in ecstasy. Fears were not dwelled upon during the initial moments of the approach. "

The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.\"",

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"",

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"",

One-hundred twenty-five years ago, Berta learned from Callahan\u2019s example how to stowaway and break the rules devised between the two planets. She taught her granddaughter how to do the same, so Trillium took this knowledge to implement her own plan. Trillium represents the women of Venus, who are tired of the lack of attention they receive from Venusian men; the men are far more interested in war and harbor misogynistic attitudes towards women. Likewise, the women rulers of Earth treat men as their inferiors as a result of their lust for Venusian women. When Trillium is discovered, this triggers a meeting between the two presidents of Earth and Venus, and the president of Earth announces that her presence on the ship signifies a breach in their rules. Therefore, the special arrangement between the two planets is ended, and Earth no longer recognizes Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship. As the Venusian president resists, he also learns that his wife Berta has been elected the new President of Venus, and that women will now take over just as they did on Earth. She orders her husband to be taken away. After Dimdooly loses his position, he announces his love for Trillium, which confirms her plan to regain the amorous attentions of Venusian men has worked. As a reward for her role in the revolution, Trillium receives Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship.\n",
                "She wanted to bring attention to her cause as a revolutionary and explain that if Earth would stop buying things from Venus, then they would stop funding Venus\u2019 wars like they have been for the past 10,000 years. Trillium explains that women of Venus would like the men of Venus to instead remain on the planet and do useful work. \nHowever, it turns out that Trillium is part of a larger plan for her grandmother to overthrow her grandfather as President of Venus, which they succeed in doing.\n",
                "Trillium\u2019s plan, which she undertook at her grandmother\u2019s behest and with her assistance, was to stow away on the Earth ship to draw the Earth president\u2019s attention to her cause. Berta and Trillium want to beseech Earth\u2019s government to stop supporting Venus\u2019s economy and funding their constant warfare. The women of Venus want the men of Venus to spend time with them rather than constantly going into battle, and Berta and Trillium have devised a way to get Earth to cooperate in their efforts to switch control of Venus from men to women. \n",
                "Trillium plans to follow her grandmother\u2019s plan and stow away on the ship and travel to Earth. She stows away because that is the only way that the women of Venus can get the attention of Earth\u2019s president. She wants Earth to agree to stop trade with Venus so that Venus will no longer have the money to keep its men in wars all the time. She claims that Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war that they don\u2019t have time for the Venus women. It is the Venus women\u2019s desire to be loved that makes them so irresistible to Earthmen. Although the Venus government allows its men two weeks at home from war each year, the Venus women want their men for longer than that so that the men can do useful work. As a result of the stowaway incident, the president of Earth cancels all trade agreements with Venus. Once Venus women have the Venus men under their power, they no longer have any interest in Earthmen. When Trillium\u2019s grandmother becomes president of Venus, she makes Trillium the new Ambassador to Earth."
