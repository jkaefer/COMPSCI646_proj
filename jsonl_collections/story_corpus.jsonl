{"id":"A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_2","contents":"Herbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\n  \n \n  She was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n  \n \n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\n  \n \n  There had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\n  \n \n  His lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n  \n \n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n  \n \n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n  \n \n  But some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\n  \n \n  He shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\n  \n \n  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance."}
{"id":"A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_3","contents":"He let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n  \n \n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n  \n \n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n  \n \n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n  \n \n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him\u2014his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name\u2014streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n  \n \n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch."}
{"id":"A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_4","contents":"The dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ..."}
{"id":"A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5","contents":"He looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before\u2014a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself\u2014and complete consciousness\u2014back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand...."}
{"id":"A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_6","contents":"She sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\n  \n \n  He wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\n  \n \n  Deep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\n  \n \n  Unless ...\n  \n \n  Yes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\n  \n \n  He took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n  \n \n  \"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\n  \n \n  His gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\n  \n \n  He drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\n  \n \n  In the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's\u2014let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n  \n \n  \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\n  \n \n  Her words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\n  \n \n  No, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others. A\nprivate room for his telporter receiver,\na private room where he\ncould take a willing guest. No! He\ncouldn't afford it! No!\n   \n   No!\n   \n  NO!\nHis lot was a cheap suit of satin!\nCheap whiskey! Cheap champagne!\nA cheap shack by the\nriver....\n  \n \n  An inarticulate cry escaped his\ntwisted lips. He clutched her roughly\nto him and dragged her through\nthe door and into the moonlight,\nwhiskey and anger lending him\nbrutal strength.\n  \n \n  He pulled her through the deserted\ngarden.\n   \n   All the others had\nprivate rooms!\n   \n  He pulled her to\nthe far end, behind a clump of\nsquatty firs. His hands clawed at\nher. He tried to smother her mouth\nwith kisses.\n  \n \n  She eluded him deftly. \"But,\n   \n   honey\n   \n  !\" Her voice had gone deeper\ninto her throat. \"I just want to be\nsure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms\u2014if\nyou can't afford to show me a good\ntime\u2014if you can't come here real\noften ...\"\n  \n \n  The whiskey pounded and\nthrobbed at his brain like blows\nfrom an unseen club. His ego\ncurled and twisted within him like\na headless serpent.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have money!\" he shouted,\nstruggling to hold her. \"I'll have\nplenty of money!

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\n  \n \n  He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\n  \n \n  He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\n  \n \n  He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\n  \n \n  Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs."}

He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful.

He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\n  \n \n  Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\n  \n \n  He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\n  \n \n  There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\n  \n \n  His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n  \n \n  \"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n  \n \n  \"What rooms?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n  \n \n  \"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n  \n \n  \"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been."}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_4","contents":"\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say it any way you want to.

The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\n  \n \n  The old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maota.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city.

Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\n  \n \n  Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\n  \n \n  The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet."}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_5","contents":"When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n  \n \n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n  \n \n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n  \n \n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n  \n \n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n  \n \n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n  \n \n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n  \n \n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n  \n \n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n  \n \n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n  \n \n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n  \n \n \n   The clock was warm.\n   \n \n \n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n  \n \n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n  \n \n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment."}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_6","contents":"When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n  \n \n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n  \n \n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n  \n \n  \"For what?\"\n  \n \n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n  \n \n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time.

It does not matter. I will\nkill you anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we negotiate.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  Maota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand\nand wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,\nbrown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Michaelson repeated.\n  \n \n  \"Why not what?\" Maota dragged his eyes back.\n  \n \n  \"Negotiate.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not\ntwenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far\naway on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.\n  \n \n  \"All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just\ndisintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer\ntoward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now what?\"\n  \n \n  \"At least read some of the book to me before I die, then.\"\n  \n \n  The gun wavered. \"I am not an unreasonable man,\" the webfoot said.\n  \n \n  Michaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.\n  \n \n  \"No, stay where you are. Throw it.\"\n  \n \n  \"This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items\naround.\"\n  \n \n  \"It won't break. Throw it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand\nagainst his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed\nthrough it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for\na suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle\nsoftly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but\nhis desire to hear the book was strong."}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_8","contents":"Old Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\n  \n \n  The old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n  \n \n  \"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\n  \n \n  Michaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\n  \n \n  He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\n  \n \n  They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums.

Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n  \n \n  \"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\n  \n \n  A black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\n  \n \n  Maota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!

They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n  \n \n  \"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n  \n \n  \"It was just a book.

I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others.

Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\n  \n \n  Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\n  \n \n  Maota pointed to it.\n  \n \n  \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\""}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_11","contents":"Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down.

You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction.

I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead."}
{"id":"A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_12","contents":"Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day.

He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window.

You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet.

He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n  \n \n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n  \n \n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\nwas the dead man's hand.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Coma esta, senor?\n   \n  \" a small voice piped. \"\n   \n   Speken die Deutsch?\nDesirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Ben looked down.\n  \n \n  The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like\na red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn\nskivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.\n  \n \n  \"I'm American,\" Ben muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\n   \n   buena\n   \n  ! I speak English\n   \n   tres\n   \n  fine,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  . I have Martian\nfriend, she\n   \n   tres\n   \n  pretty and\n   \n   tres\n   \n  fat.

{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_2","contents":"He thought,\n   \n   I don't want your Martian wench. I don't want your opium\nor your Devil's Egg or your Venusian kali. But if you had a drug that'd\nbring a dead man to life, I'd buy and pay with my soul.\n   \n \n \n  \"It is deal,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ? Five dollars or twenty\n   \n   keelis\n   \n  for visit\nMartian friend. Maybe you like House of Dreams.

I do not charge you,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The boy grabbed his hand. Because Ben could think of no reason for\nresisting, he followed. They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and\nthrough the drone of alcohol-cracked voices.\n  \n \n \n \n  They passed the bar with its line of lean-featured, slit-eyed\nEarthmen\u2014merchant spacemen.\n  \n \n  They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian\nmarble that jutted up into the semi-darkness like fog-blanketed\ntombstones.\n  \n \n  Several times, Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CO\n  2\n  -breathing\nVenusians, the first he'd ever seen.\n  \n \n  They were smoky gray, scaly, naked giants, toads in human shape.\nThey stood solitary and motionless, aloof, their green-lidded eyes\nunblinking. They certainly didn't look like telepaths, as Ben had heard\nthey were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine.\n  \n \n  Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City's Security\nPolice. The man was striding down an aisle, idly tapping his neuro-club\nagainst the stone booths.\n  \n \n \n   Keep walking\n   \n  , Ben told himself.\n   \n   You look the same as anyone else\nhere. Keep walking. Look straight ahead.\n   \n \n \n  The officer passed. Ben breathed easier.\n  \n \n  \"Here we are,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ,\" piped the Martian boy. \"A\n   \n   tres\n   \n  fine table.\nClose in the shadows.\"\n  \n \n  Ben winced. How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows?\nFrowning, he sat down\u2014he and the dead man.\n  \n \n  He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra.\n  \n \n  The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for\ntheir spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of\ntheir\n   \n   cirillas\n   \n  or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider\nlegs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still\nseemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and\nforgotten grandeur.\n  \n \n  For an instant, Ben's mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead\nman. He thought,\n   \n   What are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in\na smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world?\nCouldn't they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me,\nfelt the challenge of new worlds?\n   \n \n \n  He sobered. It didn't matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese\nwaiter. He wet his lips but did not drink. His gaze wandered over the\nfaces of the Inn's other occupants.\n  \n \n \n   You've got to find him\n   \n  , he thought.\n   \n   You've got to find the man with\nthe red beard. It's the only way you can escape the dead man."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_3","contents":"The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and\nabout forty and he hated spacemen.\n  \n \n  His body was buried now\u2014probably in the silent gray wastes outside\nLuna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a\npart of Ben as sight in his eyes.\n  \n \n  Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips\nspitting whiskey-slurred curses.\n  \n \n  Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist\nthudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the\nwhiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle\nfrom a corner of the gaping mouth.\n  \n \n  You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or\nignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a\nmemory that has burned into your mind.\n  \n \n  It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had\nbeen successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.\nHe stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb\nplopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.\n  \n \n  \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you\nsee's spacemen.\"\n  \n \n  He was a neatly dressed civilian.\n  \n \n  Ben smiled. \"If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The name's Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey\nsuits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a\nlittle tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey.\n  \n \n  Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,\ncrimson-braided uniform of the\n   \n   Odyssey's\n   \n  junior astrogation officer.\nHe was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining\nuniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\n  \n \n  He'd sought long for that key."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_4","contents":"At the age of five\u2014perhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents'\ndeath in a recent strato-jet crash\u2014he'd spent hours watching the night\nsky for streaking flame-tails of Moon rockets. At ten, he'd ground\nhis first telescope. At fourteen, he'd converted an abandoned shed on\nthe government boarding-school grounds to a retreat which housed his\ncollection of astronomy and rocketry books.\n  \n \n  At sixteen, he'd spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys\nTown No. 5 in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. There, among\nthe grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol, he'd found friends who\nunderstood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the\nU. S. Academy for the Conquest of Space.\n  \n \n  And a month ago, he'd signed aboard the\n   \n   Odyssey\n   \n  \u2014the first ship, it\nwas rumored, equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps\nbeyond.\n  \n \n  Cobb was persistent: \"Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth.\nWhat the hell good is it, jumpin' from planet to planet?\"\n  \n \n \n   The guy's drunk\n   \n  , Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three\nstools down the bar.\n  \n \n  Cobb followed. \"You don't like the truth, eh, kid? You don't like\npeople to call you a sucker.\"\n  \n \n  Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and\nheld him there.\n  \n \n  \"Thas what you are\u2014a sucker. You're young now. Wait ten years. You'll\nbe dyin' of radiation rot or a meteor'll get you. Wait and see, sucker!\"\n  \n \n  Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger. Now, suddenly and\nwithout warning, it welled up into savage fury.\n  \n \n  His fist struck the man on the chin. Cobb's eyes gaped in shocked\nhorror. He spun backward. His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of\nthe bar. The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of\nlife.\n  \n \n  He sank to the floor, eyes glassy, blood tricking down his jaw.\n  \n \n  Ben knew that he was dead.\n  \n \n  Then, for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror\u2014just as,\na moment before, he'd been overwhelmed with anger.\n  \n \n  He ran."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_5","contents":"For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\nof dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n  \n \n  At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence.

He was not sorry he'd run.\nEscaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n  \n \n \n   You can do two things\n   \n  , he thought.\n  \n \n \n   You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do.\nThat would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary\nmanslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\nprison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n   \n \n \n \n   But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new\nmen over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\njet-men on beat-up freighters\u2014they don't want convicted killers. You'd\nget the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\npeeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n   \n \n \n \n   Or\u2014\n   \n \n \n  There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\noperated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't\noutlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n  \n \n  And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\nsouped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\nheadquarters was Venus. Their leader\u2014a subject of popular and\nfantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines\u2014was rumored to be a\nred-bearded giant.\n  \n \n \n   So\n   \n  , Ben reflected,\n   \n   you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\nYou can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\nname. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\nduty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\nEarth.\n   \n \n \n  After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\nsecond, to destroy a man's life and his dream?"}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_6","contents":"He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh.

You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot!

{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_7","contents":"Light showered the room in a dazzling explosion. Ben, half blinded,\nrealized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been\nturned on.\n  \n \n  The light washed away the room's strangeness and its air of brooding\nwickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor.\n  \n \n  Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and\na chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like\ntatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward,\nfalling.\n  \n \n  The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised.\n  \n \n  A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with\nfeline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained\nundisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in\nBen's direction.\n  \n \n  \"Curtis!\" one of the policemen yelled. \"You're covered! Hold it!\"\n  \n \n  Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into\nwhich the musicians had disappeared.\n  \n \n  A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air\nescaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall\nahead of him crumbled.\n  \n \n  He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the\nmildly stunning neuro-clubs.\n  \n \n  Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit.\n   \n   Another second\n   \n  , his brain screamed.\n   \n   Just another second\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Or would the exits be guarded?\n  \n \n  He heard the hiss.\n  \n \n  It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a\nslight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_8","contents":"He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be\ngrowing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny\nneedle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing\nmortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of\nhis body.\n  \n \n  He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have\nfifteen\u2014maybe twenty\u2014seconds before complete lethargy of mind and\nbody overpowered him.\n  \n \n  In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice\nyell, \"Turn on the damn lights!\"\n  \n \n  Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that\nsomeone had seized it.\n  \n \n  A soft feminine voice spoke to him. \"You're wounded? They hit you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\" His thick lips wouldn't let go of the word.\n  \n \n  \"You want to escape\u2014even now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may die if you don't give yourself up.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to stumble toward the exit.\n  \n \n  \"All right then. Not that way. Here, this way.\"\n  \n \n  Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight\nflicked on.\n  \n \n  Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A\ndoor closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his\nvision\u2014if he still had vision.\n  \n \n  \"You're sure?\" the voice persisted.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure,\" Ben managed to say.\n  \n \n  \"I have no antidote. You may die.\"\n  \n \n  His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection,\nmassage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain\nwithin half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to\nheart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective\nweapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender\nat once.\n  \n \n  \"Anti ... anti ...\" The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced\nfrom his throat. \"No ... I'm sure ... sure.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't hear the answer or anything else."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_9","contents":"Ben Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening. Return to\nconsciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black\nnothingness to a dream-like state of awareness.\n  \n \n  He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders,\nhands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and\nsensitivity. He knew they were strong hands. Their strength seemed to\ntransfer itself to his own body.\n  \n \n  For a long time, he tried to open his eyes. His lids felt welded\nshut. But after a while, they opened. His world of darkness gave way\nto a translucent cloak of mist. A round, featureless shape hovered\nconstantly above him\u2014a face, he supposed.\n  \n \n  He tried to talk. Although his lips moved slightly, the only sound was\na deep, staccato grunting.\n  \n \n  But he heard someone say, \"Don't try to talk.\" It was the same gentle\nvoice he'd heard in the Blast Inn. \"Don't talk. Just lie still and\nrest. Everything'll be all right.\"\n  \n \n \n   Everything all right\n   \n  , he thought dimly.\n  \n \n  There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing. There\nwere periods of light and of darkness. Gradually he grew aware of\nthings. He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman's oxygen\nmask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets\nswathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and\nhe would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach.\n  \n \n  Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring\nmist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears:\n  \n \n  \"Swallow this now. That's it. You must have food.\" Or, \"Close your\neyes. Don't strain. It won't be long. You're getting better.\"\n  \n \n \n   Better\n   \n  , he'd think.\n   \n   Getting better....\n   \n \n \n  At last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The\nmist brightened, then dissolved.\n  \n \n  He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless\nwalls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his\naluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket.\n  \n \n  Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.\n  \n \n  \"You are better?\" the kind voice asked."}
{"id":"A_Coffin_for_Jacob_10","contents":"The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five\nand thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking\npallor, as if she hadn't used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the\nsame time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her\nstraight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and\ndrawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck.\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I am better,\" he murmured.

Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man.

The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the\nhumidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in\na cloudless blue sky.\n  \n \n  His pockets were picked eleven times.\n  \n \n  It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a\nmasterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey\nFownes' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He\nwas strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses,\none after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions.\nBut he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to\nbegin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so\ndeeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many\npeople were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome\nConditions (a crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%) when a bogus\npostman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the\nconfusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman\nrifled Fownes's handkerchief and inside jacket pockets."}
{"id":"A_FALL_OF_GLASS_2","contents":"He was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl\nhappened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his\nright and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence.\nThe sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time.\nHe should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a\nheated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his\nrear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the\nhandkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put\nand take\u2014the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he\nwas playing.\n  \n \n  There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.\n  \n \n  It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist,\nhitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of\na celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light\nfragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome\nweevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the\nhuge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.\n  \n \n  Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still\nintrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity\nthat was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this\nrather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight\nsurveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting\nhis fingerprints off the postman's bag, and which photographed, X-rayed\nand chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning\nthem. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a\nfive-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of\nParis. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and\nhandedness behind.\n  \n \n  By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete\nwith photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an\norange patrol car parked down the street."}
{"id":"A_FALL_OF_GLASS_3","contents":"Lanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job.\n  \n \n  Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes\napproach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an\nodd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar\nto that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and\nparticularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope.\n  \n \n  Lanfierre's job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn't be tolerated\nwithin the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social\nforce; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it,\nLanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that\ngenuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own\nsmall efforts, rarer.\n  \n \n  Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable.\nLanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes his house\n   \n   shakes\n   \n  ,\" Lanfierre said.\n  \n \n  \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he\nstopped and frowned. He reread what he'd just written.\n  \n \n  \"You heard right. The house\n   \n   shakes\n   \n  ,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it.\n  \n \n  MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of\nthe windshield. \"Like from ...\n   \n   side to side\n   \n  ?\" he asked in a somewhat\npatronizing tone of voice.\n  \n \n  \"And up and down.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange\nuniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed\nthe dossier carelessly on the back seat.\n  \n \n  Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride\ncouldn't really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride\nwas a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He\nhad even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly\nabsurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was\nonly with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes\nto MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had\nseen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly\nresounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke\nin an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably\ntrite.\n  \n \n  Then a fine robust freak came along and the others\u2014the echoes\u2014refused\nto believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a\nvacation.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested.\n  \n \n  \"It's like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A\nzephyr?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've heard some.\"\n  \n \n  \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong\nwinds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can't imagine. And if there was\na house sitting on such a mountain and if winds\n   \n   did\n   \n  blow, it would\nshake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the\nwhole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down\nthe avenue.\""}

Why else close the windows in a domed city?\nAnd then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into\nconversation\u2014and that's why the house shakes.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride whistled.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't need a vacation.\"\n  \n \n  A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the\nwindshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\n  \n \n  \"No, you don't need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You're starting to see\nflying houses, hear loud babbling voices.

He could have a whole\nfamily of thirsty and clean kids, and he\n   \n   still\n   \n  wouldn't need all that\nwater.\"\n  \n \n  The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages\nnow in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did\nyou see what he carries in his pockets?\"\n  \n \n  \"And compasses won't work on this street.\"\n  \n \n  The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\n  \n \n  He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It\nexpressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\nneurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\nwas something implacable about his sighs.\n  \n \n  \"He'll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\nwith a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\nthe widow's next door and then the library.\"\n  \n \n  MacBride's eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\nsaid. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\n  \n \n  Lanfierre nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\n  \n \n  \"I can't wait to see what he's got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\nwatching the house with a consuming interest.\n  \n \n  They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\nwidened as the house danced a new step."}

He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation\nof his was also responsible for the dancing house\u2014he simply hadn't\nnoticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He\nhad a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the\nhigh-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the\nhouse. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watch\nfrom outside.\n  \n \n  He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room\nleft in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a\ndraw-pull.\n  \n \n  Every window slammed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the\ncloset at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that\nright? No,\n   \n   snug as a hug in a rug\n   \n  . He went on, thinking:\n   \n   The old\ndevils.\n   \n \n \n  The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of\nwheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw\nthat went back and forth 365-1\/4 times an hour. The wheels had a\ncurious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from\ngrandfather's clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful\ncircles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there\nwas one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He\nwatched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for\nseven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.\n  \n \n  Outside, the domed city vanished.\n  \n \n  It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,\nthe illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more\nsatisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.\nLooking through the window he saw only a garden.\n  \n \n  Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun\nsetting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left\nthe smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a\nhuge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a\ngarden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.\n  \n \n  Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.\n   \n   And cocktails for\ntwo.\n   \n  Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched as\nthe moon played,\n   \n   Oh, You Beautiful Doll\n   \n  and the neon roses flashed\nslowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on\nthe scent.

Not to mention a moon. But\nthen, neither did the widow. He'd have to be confident, assertive.\n   \n   Insist\n   \n  on it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic\nromantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy\nfingers marching up and down your spine?\n  \n \n  His own spine didn't seem to be affected. But then he hadn't read that\nbook on ancient mores and courtship customs.\n  \n \n  How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly\nlong and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount\nof falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\"\nmeant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the\ncircumstances.

That might be\nit.\n   \n   I was wondering, seeing as how it's so late, if you wouldn't\nrather stay over instead of going home....\n   \n \n \n  Preoccupied, he hadn't noticed the winds building up, didn't hear the\nshaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected\nto wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made\none gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as\nhigh-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the\nStudebaker valve wider and wider....\n  \n \n  The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other.

The twister\nwas unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like\na malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying\na Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn't help wondering if twisters did anything\nto feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit\nnight, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket\nin his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling\nafter him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though\nreading inscriptions on a tombstone."}

Personally, he\nwas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n  \n \n  At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\ndotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\nPottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\nhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers\u2014Koltan, eldest\nand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\ntreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\nthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n  \n \n  \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\nthese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength\nand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may\ncome and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the\nfame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   is\n   \n  a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's\nphilosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in\nLor.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran\nrather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"\n  \n \n  By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,\nwhich the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting\nto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\nvery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken."}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_2","contents":"Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his\nown counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough\nfor him.

We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means\nof transport.\"\n  \n \n  Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret\nconclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.\nThe speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\n  \n \n  \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,\nremember your position in the family.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his\nhead than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of\nthe clay.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him\na beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough\nthing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in\ntheir desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they\ndid.\n  \n \n  Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought\nabout the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way\nof metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could\nfigure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of\nhis brothers.

One day, a fleet of ships\narrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was\npractically acrawl with Earthmen.\n  \n \n  Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called\n\"corporations\"\u2014Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The\nobject of the visit was trade.\n  \n \n  In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian\ncity of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took\nsome time for the news to spread.\n  \n \n  The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the\npottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an\naluminum pot at him.\n  \n \n  \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\n  \n \n  \"A pot.

And you will have\nto design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be idiotic!

Already, I am\nsorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen.

The populace fervidly brushed up on its\nscanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by\nthe novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book\u2014a primer in the Lorian\nlanguage\u2014and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the\nbrothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.\n  \n \n  Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire\u2014more than enough\nin value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur\u2014and set up\ntelegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent.\nWithin five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major\ncity on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed\nthe instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph.

Of course, profits on the line of new stoves\ngreatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but\ntheir business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from\nEarth.\n  \n \n  About this time, plastic utensils\u2014dishes, cups, knives, forks\u2014made\ntheir appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the\nnewfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for\neverything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade.\nWhat they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They\ndestroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.\n  \n \n  The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of\nMasur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth."}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_6","contents":"Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan\ncalled an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his\nsenile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man\nmight still have a little wit left that could be helpful.\n  \n \n  \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine\nour business,\" and he read off the figures.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before,\nand will result in something even better for us.\"\n  \n \n  Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly\nsubsided.\n  \n \n  \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior\nterrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that\nsells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their\neyes, we can be ruined.\"\n  \n \n  The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while\nFather Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got\nnowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.\n  \n \n  \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom\nof your trouble, but the\n   \n   things\n   \n  of Earth. Think of the telegraph and\nthe newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth.\nThe merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these\nnewspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are\nintrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to\nbuy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you\nmight also have advertisements of your own.\"\n  \n \n  Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising\nfrom the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the\nadvertisements of the Earthmen.\n  \n \n  In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the\nbrothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several\nthings had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal\nrest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had\nprocured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which\nthey found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What\nthey did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered\nin the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working\nunder supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil\nregions to every major and minor city on Zur."}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_7","contents":"By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\nterrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\ngas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\nwas gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\nat a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\nbrothers Masur.\n  \n \n  The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\nenergetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n  \n \n  At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\nfor a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\ndeparted from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\nMasur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\nmuch new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n  \n \n  \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\nblackly.\n  \n \n  In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\nreceiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\nloaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\nradio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the\nnatural follow-up in its campaign of advertising\u2014radio programs\u2014with\ncommercials.\n  \n \n  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\nthey would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\npaused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\nmodern\u2014keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\nall in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\ngreat, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\nten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\nare even bringing\n   \n   autos\n   \n  to Zur!\"\n  \n \n  The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these\nhitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n  \n \n  \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\nEarthmen are taking care of that.\"\n  \n \n  At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\nthat they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\nand street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\nhighways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\nyet."}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_8","contents":"Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people\nbought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways\nwere constructed.\n  \n \n  The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants\nand began to manufacture Portland cement.\n  \n \n  You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of\ncourse, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either\ntile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff\nmade far better road surfacing.\n  \n \n  The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.\n  \n \n  The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot\nhandle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising\nCouncil.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is that?\" asked Koltan.\n  \n \n  \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as\nyours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain\nin the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with\nit. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"\n  \n \n  The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to\nZotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling\nhim in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.\n  \n \n  All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the\npurpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they\nhad to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.\n  \n \n  Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated\non their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not\nsurprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to\nmake room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved\nwith something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering\nnew automobiles.\n  \n \n  An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now\nthat they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached\nwith desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and\nthey were the envied ones of Zur.\n  \n \n  Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands\njovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a\nbetter look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual\nwith genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in\nthe baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for\nan indefinite sense of alienness about him.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping\nZotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you\nstraightened out in no time.\""}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_9","contents":"All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\noccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n  \n \n  Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\nmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\nthe world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab\nMasur\u2014Divinity protect him\u2014departed this life to collect his greater\nreward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and\nbones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone\nis the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and\nall because of new things coming from Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come\nto me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,\nwe're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth\u2014always to\ndo right by the customer.\"\n  \n \n  \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for\ndamages.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense\nfortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your\ntrouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do\nyou own an automobile?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\n  \n \n  Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes\nthe music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the\nbargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\n  \n \n  \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these\nluxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off\nwith a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car\nfrom the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered\nand installed in your home.\"\n  \n \n  \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to\nyou absolutely free\u2014a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is\nthat you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to\nmake profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the\nGalaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out\nthe full program takes time.\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our\nextremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise,\nbut sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the\nmotto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\""}
{"id":"A_Gift_From_Earth_10","contents":"The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it\nwas no more than fair to pay transportation.\n  \n \n  He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"\n  \n \n  Broderick told him.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is\nsixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the\nmerchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering\nthe cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together\nhave so much money any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you\ncredit!\"\n  \n \n  \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.\n  \n \n  \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the\nrich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the\ninvolutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that\nmight have had a discouraging effect.\n  \n \n  On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.\nZotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do\nto get credit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our\nEasy Payment Plan.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for\nmyself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each\nof your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is\nall there is to it.\"\n  \n \n  It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul\nwrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.\n  \n \n  \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will\nhave the figures.\"\n  \n \n  The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul\npointed this out politely.\n  \n \n  \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all,\nyou get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be\npaid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.\nThis small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our\nplant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You\nwill start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain\nparts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local\nmanufacture to help bring prices down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't the equipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only\na quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial\ncompany.\""}

From pumps owned by a\nterrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from\nthe crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit.\nThe food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges,\nserved up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the\nwinter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though\nthey had gas-fired central heating.\n  \n \n  About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric\ngenerators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of\nelectrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason,\nbatteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to\nbuy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\n  \n \n  The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan.\nThey had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric\nfans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could\npossibly sell them.\n  \n \n  \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but\nmeantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"\n  \n \n  But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.\nThe Pottery of Masur had no more contracts.

They had less\nmoney and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television\nkept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the\npangs of impoverishment.\n  \n \n  The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul\ndesigned and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons\nwere a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold\nthem for less.\n  \n \n  The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any\nmore, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\n  \n \n  \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with\nfists. \"Go see Broderick.

There was even a hint\nof toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\n  \n \n  \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He\nlooked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of\nmaking it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\n  \n \n  \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything\nattached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are\nattached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that\u2014yet.

No. When I communicate with you,\nI see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are\nno terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in\nnot-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my\nbirth.\n  \n \n  Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited\nequipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor\ncame in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation\nreigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What\ndifference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.\nAs they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,\nsince I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother\n(Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up\ntheir hands and left.\n  \n \n  I learned the following day that the opposite component of my\nnot-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance\nduring my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a\nbender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.\n  \n \n  When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I\nmade a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36\nnot-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was\nstanding by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.\nHe stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of\nspeech.\n  \n \n  Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I\nproduced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.\n  \n \n  \"Poppa,\" I said.\n  \n \n  This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that\nare now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded\nlow-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have\njarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the\nroom.\n  \n \n  They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something\nabout my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at\nthe doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,\nshe fell down heavily. She made a distinct\n   \n   thump\n   \n  on the floor.\n  \n \n  This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window\nand retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,\nbut I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!\n  \n \n  I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the\ncleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply\nfrom Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise\nindeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.\nBut you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself\nand it's his nature never to flatter anyone.\n  \n \n  From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the\nqualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this\nalleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive\nmythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people\nrefer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we\nlearned otherwise, while they never have.\n  \n \n  New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them.

Then I\nestablish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his\nknowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my\nletter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he\nhas done.\n  \n \n  My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an\nindividual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but\nI fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell\nyou about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have\naccomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.\n  \n \n  In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of\nsleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out.\nAnyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.\n  \n \n  As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ...\nmy brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire\nthe stuff needed for the destruction of these people.\n  \n \n  Sunrise came as I expected.

This is truly an efficient\nmechanism I inhabit.\n  \n \n  I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions.\nIt was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried\nimmediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up\nand all about me at the beauty.\n  \n \n  Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I\nsimply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was\nto realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not\nlet yourself believe they do.\n  \n \n  This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here.\nHer hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She\nwore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was\ndiverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.\n  \n \n  The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from\nnearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with\nan attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told\nmyself. But they were.\n  \n \n  I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you\nunfortunately do not have\u2014invisibility. I lay there and listened.\n  \n \n  \"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.\n  \n \n  A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.\n  \n \n  \"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of\nthis area.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,\" the officer ordered. \"No more speeches\nin the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now\nwhere is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.\"\n  \n \n  That was it\u2014I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this\noversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions\nthat assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty,\npain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I\nmust feel each, become accustomed to it.\n  \n \n  The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I\nhave been given is very unrealistic.

I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed\nbending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent\nindeed. Ah!

A sensation comes to me when I am\nburned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,\nI experience a tickle.\n  \n \n  This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group\nof symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh!

Would you\nbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the\nmoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\n  \n \n  Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve\nends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these\nimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the\nadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the\nentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\n  \n \n  I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the\ntingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself\nquickly.\n  \n \n  Now in all the motion pictures\u2014true representations of life and love\nin this world\u2014the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl\nand tries to induce her to do something biological.

Do I make myself clear?\n  \n \n  I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.\nWell, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I\nhad not found love.\n  \n \n  I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell\nasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin\nand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.\n  \n \n  I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha.

At\nleast, that's what he told me.\n  \n \n  I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\nsomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\nSpace II.

The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\nby with gravy.\n  \n \n  \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\nhis fingers.

That was before I'd reported\nhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\nthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\nHe still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\nreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\nany military organization, he outranked me.\n  \n \n  \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n  \n \n  \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\nfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\nlike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\nPersonal habits? Anything?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\nany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\ndoes have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\""}
{"id":"A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_2","contents":"The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on\nthat trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought\nabout Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that\nrevolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started\npushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if\nthe whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took\nover. Swell guy, Walsh.\n  \n \n  Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic\nI was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like\na mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere\nI looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd\nnever seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\n  \n \n  I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me\nabout. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about\nhim was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have\nbeen stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to\nnormal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\n  \n \n  I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\n  \n \n  He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance\nbetween us in seconds.\n  \n \n  \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\n  \n \n  I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this\n   \n   was\n   \n  going to be a\nsimple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at\nhis use of Terran idiom.\n  \n \n  \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a\npocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began\nwondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking\nfor. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately\nupon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him\nanyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a\ndrink first.\n  \n \n  \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\n  \n \n  \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a\nheavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when\nhe dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\n  \n \n  The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that\nprotected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable\nbut I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped\nthe native thirty solars.\n  \n \n  He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh\nwell, you're new here. We'll let it go.\"\n  \n \n  He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd\nmeant. Had I tipped him too little?\n  \n \n  I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it\nlooked as hot as hell.\n  \n \n  On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to\ncurse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game\nand a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\n  \n \n  I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\n  \n \n  He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe,\" he said again.\n  \n \n  A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\n\"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about\nMars, would you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\n  \n \n  That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\n  \n \n \n   But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like\n   \n  Joe.\n   \n   Among the natives, I mean.\n   \n \n \n  Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most\ncontemptible....\n  \n \n  \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\"\n  \n \n  \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\"\n  \n \n  I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at\nthe bartender.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\n  \n \n  I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a\ngreat gag. Very funny. Very....\n  \n \n  \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's\nabout ready to post you as overdue.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\n  \n \n  \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\n  \n \n  \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back."}
{"id":"A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_3","contents":"Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me."}
{"id":"A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_4","contents":"I began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of\nme. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed\nlike a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something\nthat had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be\nback again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set\nfor me.\n  \n \n  Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back.\n  \n \n  The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider\nit seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing\nat the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a\nfew more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with\nSpace II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken\nplace like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too.\nBut what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in\ncommand. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I\ncould understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.\n  \n \n  I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good\npoints against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A\nguy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of\nuranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched,\nwould deliberately do just about anything.\n  \n \n  Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may\nhave been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a\ngag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.\n  \n \n  The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall,\nelongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.\n  \n \n  \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him.\n  \n \n  \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.\n  \n \n  \"When can we leave?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of\nsupplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear\nlight clothing, boots, and a hat.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will I need a weapon?\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What's your name, by the way?\"\n  \n \n  He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was\ndefinitely surprised.\n  \n \n  \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn't you know?\""}
{"id":"A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_5","contents":"When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\nboots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n  \n \n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n  \n \n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining."}
{"id":"A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_6","contents":"Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n  \n \n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n  \n \n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n  \n \n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n  \n \n  \"What...?\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n  \n \n  The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\nthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\nstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\ncheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n  \n \n  \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\njoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n  \n \n  Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\nhappiness.\n  \n \n  \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\nwas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n  \n \n  I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\n   \n   Major\n   \n  .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\nfinality.\n  \n \n  I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\nbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\npointing the stun gun at my middle.\n  \n \n  \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\nhave.\"\n  \n \n  Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis. Another of those funny Terran games.\n  \n \n  \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\nshould thank you, really.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\nwhen you decided to cork off.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\nnudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\nsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n  \n \n  Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\naudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\nlittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\nunimportant drama.\n  \n \n  I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n  \n \n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices.

Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n  \n \n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n  \n \n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\ncolonel in puzzlement."}

{"id":"ACID_BATH_2","contents":"Jon Karyl\n  was bolting in a new baffle\nplate on the stationary rocket engine.\nIt was a tedious job and took all his\nconcentration. So he wasn't paying too much\nattention to what was going on in other\nparts of the little asteroid.\n  \n \n  He didn't see the peculiar blue space\nship, its rockets throttled down, as it drifted\nto land only a few hundred yards away from\nhis plastic igloo.\n  \n \n  Nor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue\ncreatures slide out of the peculiar vessel's\nairlock.\n  \n \n  It was only as he crawled out of the\ndepths of the rocket power plant that he\nrealized something was wrong.\n  \n \n  By then it was almost too late. The six\nblue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching\nhim at a lope.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl took one look and went bounding\nover the asteroid's rocky slopes in fifty-foot\nbounds.\n  \n \n  When you're a Lone Watcher, and\nstrangers catch you unawares, you don't\nstand still.

The automatic alarm should have\nshrilled out a warning.\n  \n \n  Then he saved as much of his breath as\nhe could as some sort of power wave tore\nup the rocky sward to his left. He twisted\nand zig-zagged in his flight, trying to get\nout of sight of the strangers.\n  \n \n  Once hidden from their eyes, he could cut\nback and head for the underground entrance\nto the service station.\n  \n \n  He glanced back finally.\n  \n \n  Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting\nafter him, and rapidly closing the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol\nat his side, turned the oxygen dial up for\ngreater exertion, increased the gravity pull\nin his space-suit boots as he neared the\nravine he'd been racing for.\n  \n \n  The oxygen was just taking hold when\nhe hit the lip of the ravine and began\nsprinting through its man-high bush-strewn\ncourse.\n  \n \n  The power ray from behind ripped out\ngreat gobs of the sheltering bushes. But\nrunning naturally, bent close to the bottom\nof the ravine, Jon Karyl dodged the bare\nspots. The oxygen made the tremendous\nexertion easy for his lungs as he sped down\nthe dim trail, hidden from the two steel-blue\nstalkers.\n  \n \n  He'd eluded them, temporarily at least,\nJon Karyl decided when he finally edged off\nthe dim trail and watched for movement\nalong the route behind him.\n  \n \n  He stood up, finally, pushed aside the\nleafy overhang of a bush and looked for\nlandmarks along the edge of the ravine.\n  \n \n  He found one, a stubby bush, shaped like\na Maltese cross, clinging to the lip of the\nravine. The hidden entrance to the service\nstation wasn't far off.\n  \n \n  His pistol held ready, he moved quietly\non down the ravine until the old water\ncourse made an abrupt hairpin turn.\n  \n \n  Instead of following around the sharp\nbend, Jon Karyl moved straight ahead\nthrough the overhanging bushes until he\ncame to a dense thicket. Dropping to his\nhands and knees he worked his way under\nthe edge of the thicket into a hollowed-out\nspace in the center."}
{"id":"ACID_BATH_3","contents":"There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n  \n \n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n  \n \n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n  \n \n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n  \n \n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n  \n \n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n  \n \n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n  \n \n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n  \n \n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n  \n \n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n  \n \n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n  \n \n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n  \n \n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n  \n \n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n  \n \n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n  \n \n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n  \n \n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n  \n \n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled."}
{"id":"ACID_BATH_4","contents":"Jon\n  followed him through the sundered\nlock of the station. Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n  \n \n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have. We were surprised you\u2014earthmen,\nis it?\u2014use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked,\nhardly expecting an answer.\n  \n \n  It came anyway. \"For the same reason you\nEarthmen are reaching out farther into your\nsystem. We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n  \n \n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n  \n \n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n  \n \n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n  \n \n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n  \n \n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n  \n \n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n  \n \n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n  \n \n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n  \n \n  \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\"\nJon's guide added.\n  \n \n  \"Examine him first, then give him the\ndeath.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from\nthe lighted room through more corridors.\nIf it got too bad he still had the stubray\npistol.\n  \n \n  Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on\nthe lonely, nerve-wracking job of service\nstation attendant just to see what it offered.\n  \n \n  Here was a part of it, and it was certainly\nsomething new.\n  \n \n  \"This is the examination room,\" his\nSteel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.\n  \n \n  A green effulgence surrounded him."}
{"id":"ACID_BATH_5","contents":"There\n  was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the\ntiny microphone on the outside of his\nsuit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go\nthrough his body. Then it seemed as if a\nhalf dozen hands were inside him, examining\nhis internal organs. His stomach contracted.\nHe felt a squeeze on his heart. His\nlungs tickled.\n  \n \n  There were several more queer motions\ninside his body.\n  \n \n  Then another Steel-Blue voice said:\n  \n \n  \"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of\nmetals that melt at a very low temperature.\nHe also contains a liquid whose makeup I\ncannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him\nback when the torture is done.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What\nkind of torture could this be?\n  \n \n  Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the\nchronometer on his wrist.\n  \n \n  Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien\nship and halted expectantly just outside the\nship's lock.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the\nstubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my\nway out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he\ntoted up the disadvantages.\n  \n \n  He either would have to find a hiding\nplace on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues\nwanted him bad enough they could tear the\nwhole place to pieces, or somehow get\naboard the little life ship hidden in the\nservice station.\n  \n \n  In that he would be just a sitting duck.\n  \n \n  He shrugged off the slight temptation to\nuse the pistol. He was still curious.\n  \n \n  And he was interested in staying alive as\nlong as possible. There was a remote chance\nhe might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,\nhe glanced toward his belt to see the little\npower pack which, if under ideal conditions,\ncould finger out fifty thousand miles into\nspace.\n  \n \n  If he could somehow stay alive the 21\ndays he might be able to warn the patrol.\nHe couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for\nhis life would be snuffed out immediately.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue said quietly:\n  \n \n  \"It might be ironical to let you warn\nthat SP ship you keep thinking about. But\nwe know your weapon now. Already our\nship is equipped with a force field designed\nespecially to deflect your atomic guns.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts\nquickly. They can delve deeper than the\nsurface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a\nleash on my thoughts?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get\u2014absent-minded,\nis it?\u2014every once in a\nwhile.\"\n  \n \n  Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared\nlugging great sheets of plastic and various\nother equipment.\n  \n \n  They dumped their loads and began unbundling\nthem.\n  \n \n  Working swiftly, they built a plastic\nigloo, smaller than the living room in the\nlarger service station igloo. They ranged instruments\ninside\u2014one of them Jon Karyl\nrecognized as an air pump from within the\nstation\u2014and they laid out a pallet.\n  \n \n  When they were done Jon saw a miniature\nreproduction of the service station, lacking\nonly the cannon cap and fin, and with clear\nplastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the\nother.\n  \n \n  His Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced\nthe atmosphere of your station so that you\nbe watched while you undergo the torture\nunder the normal conditions of your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked.\n  \n \n  The answer was almost caressing: \"It is\na liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes\njoints to harden if even so much as a drop\nremains on it long. It eats away the metal,\nleaving a scaly residue which crumbles\neventually into dust.\n  \n \n  \"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid\nfor you since No. 1 does not wish you to die\ninstantly.\n  \n \n  \"Enter your\"\u2014the Steel-Blue hesitated\u2014\"mausoleum.\nYou die in your own atmosphere.\nHowever, we took the liberty of purifying\nit. There were dangerous elements in\nit.\"\n  \n \n  Jon walked into the little igloo. The\nSteel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials\nand switches on the outside. Jon's space suit\ndeflated. Pressure was building up in the\nigloo.\n  \n \n  He took a sample of the air, found that\nit was good, although quite rich in oxygen\ncompared with what he'd been using in the\nservice station and in his suit.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet\nand gulped huge draughts of the air.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the pallet and waited\nfor the torture to begin.\n  \n \n  The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo,\nstaring at him through elliptical eyes.\n  \n \n  Apparently, they too, were waiting for the\ntorture to begin.\n  \n \n  Jon thought the excess of oxygen was\nmaking him light-headed.\n  \n \n  He stared at a cylinder which was beginning\nto sprout tentacles from the circle.\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again. An\nopening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a\nspacescope, was appearing in the center of\nthe cylinder.\n  \n \n  A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the\nopening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder\nthat had sprouted tentacles. It contained a\nyellowish liquid.\n  \n \n  One of the tentacles reached into the\nopening and clasped the glass. The opening\nclosed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor\nappendages, moved toward Jon.\n  \n \n  He didn't like the looks of the liquid in\nthe tumbler. It looked like an acid of some\nsort. He raised to his feet.\n  \n \n  He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared\nto blast the cylinder."}
{"id":"ACID_BATH_6","contents":"The\n  cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his\neyes jump in his head. He brought the\nstubray gun up\u2014but he was helpless. The\npistol kept on going up. With a deft movement,\none of the tentacles had speared it\nfrom his hand and was holding it out of\nhis reach.\n  \n \n  Jon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's\nhand. But he was too slow. Two tentacles\ngripped the kicking leg. Another struck him\nin the chest, knocking him to the pallet. The\nsame tentacle, assisted by a new one,\npinioned his shoulders.\n  \n \n  Four tentacles held him supine. The cylinder\nlifted a glass-like cap from the tumbler\nof liquid.\n  \n \n  Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering\nan old fairy tale he'd read as a kid.\nSomething about a fellow named Socrates\nwho was given a cup of hemlock to drink.\nIt was the finis for Socrates. But the old\nhero had been nonchalant and calm about\nthe whole thing.\n  \n \n  With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious\nunto death, relaxed and said, \"All right,\nbub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll\ntake it like a man.\"\n  \n \n  The cylinder apparently understood him,\nfor it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered\nhis stubray pistol.\n  \n \n  Jon brought the glass of liquid under his\nnose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent.\nIt brought tears to his eyes.\n  \n \n  He looked at the cylinder, then at the\nSteel-Blues crowding around the plastic\nigloo. He waved the glass at the audience.\n  \n \n  \"To Earth, ever triumphant,\" he toasted.\nThen he drained the glass at a gulp.\n  \n \n  Its taste was bitter, and he felt hot\nprickles jab at his scalp. It was like eating\nvery hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears.\nHe coughed as the stuff went down.\n  \n \n  But he was still alive, he thought in\namazement. He'd drunk the hemlock and\nwas still alive.\n  \n \n  The reaction set in quickly. He hadn't\nknown until then how tense he'd been. Now\nwith the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He\nlaid down on the pallet and went to sleep.\n  \n \n  There was one lone Steel-Blue watching\nhim when he rubbed the sleep out of his\neyes and sat up.\n  \n \n  He vanished almost instantly. He, or another\nlike him, returned immediately accompanied\nby a half-dozen others, including\nthe multi-tentacled creature known as No. 1.\n  \n \n  One said,\n  \n \n  \"You are alive.\" The thought registered\namazement. \"When you lost consciousness,\nwe thought you had\"\u2014there was a hesitation\u2014\"as\nyou say, died.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Jon Karyl said. \"I didn't die. I\nwas just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.\"\nThe Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.\n  \n \n  \"Good it is that you live. The torture\nwill continue,\" spoke No. 1 before loping\naway.\n  \n \n  The cylinder business began again. This\ntime, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying\nto figure out what it was. It had a\nfamiliar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't\nquite put a taste-finger on it.\n  \n \n  His belly said he was hungry. He glanced\nat his chronometer. Only 20 days left before\nthe SP ship arrived.\n  \n \n  Would this torture\u2014he chuckled\u2014last\nuntil then? But he was growing more and\nmore conscious that his belly was screaming\nfor hunger. The liquid had taken the edge\noff his thirst.\n  \n \n  It was on the fifth day of his torture that\nJon Karyl decided that he was going to get\nsomething to eat or perish in the attempt.\n  \n \n  The cylinder sat passively in its niche in\nthe circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching\nas Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed\nhis stubray.\n  \n \n  They merely watched as he pressed the\nstubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked\nout of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol.\nThe plastic splintered.\n  \n \n  Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and\nstriding toward his own igloo adjacent to\nthe service station when a Steel-Blue\naccosted him.\n  \n \n  \"Out of my way,\" grunted Jon, waving\nthe stubray. \"I'm hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,\" said\nthe creature who barred his way. \"Go back\nto your torture.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of\nyour tentacles and eat it without seasoning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eat?\" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"I want to refuel. I've got to have food\nto keep my engine going.\"\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled. \"So the hemlock, as\nyou call it, is beginning to affect you at\nlast? Back to the torture room.\"\n  \n \n  \"Like R-dust,\" Jon growled. He pressed\nthe firing stud on the stubray gun. One of\nSteel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to\nthe rocky sward.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used\nonce before. A tentacle danced over it.\n  \n \n  Abruptly Jon found himself standing on\na pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a\nswath around him 15 feet deep and five feet\nwide.\n  \n \n  \"Back to the room,\" Steel-Blue commanded.\n  \n \n  Jon resheathed the stubray pistol,\nshrugged non-committally and leaped the\ntrench. He walked slowly back and reentered\nthe torture chamber.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage\nhe'd done.\n  \n \n  As he watched them, Jon was still curious,\nbut he was getting mad underneath at\nthe cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.\n  \n \n  By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by\nher green fields, and dark forests, he'd\nstay alive to warn the SP ship.\n  \n \n  Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send\nthe story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid\nto it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could\nequip themselves with spray guns and squirt\ncitric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade\naway.\n  \n \n  It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The\nfruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders\u2014it\ndoesn't sound possible. That couldn't be\nthe answer.\n  \n \n  Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl\ndiscovered a week later.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue who had captured him in\nthe power room of the service station came\nin to examine him.\n  \n \n  \"You're still holding out, I see,\" he observed\nafter poking Jon in every sensitive\npart of his body.\n  \n \n  \"I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase\nthe power of the\u2014ah\u2014hemlock. How do\nyou feel?\"\n  \n \n  Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness\nof hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he\nanswered honestly enough: \"My guts feel as\nif they're chewing each other up. My bones\nache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm\nso hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is the hemlock,\" Steel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  It was when he quaffed the new and\nstronger draught that Jon knew that his\nhope that it was citric acid was squelched.\n  \n \n  The acid taste was weaker which meant\nthat the citric acid was the diluting liquid.\nIt was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath\nthe tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive\nacid.\n  \n \n  On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak\nhe didn't feel much like moving around. He\nlet the cylinder feed him the hemlock.\n  \n \n  No. 1 came again to see him, and went\naway chuckling, \"Decrease the dilution.\nThis Earthman at last is beginning to\nsuffer.\""}

And they were doing a little\ntarget practice with plastic bubbles only a\nfew miles above the asteroid.\n  \n \n  When his chronometer clocked off the\nbeginning of the twenty-first day, Jon received\na tumbler of the hemlock from the\nhands of No. 1 himself.\n  \n \n  \"It is the hemlock,\" he chuckled, \"undiluted.\nDrink it and your torture is over.\nYou will die before your SP ship is destroyed.\n  \n \n  \"We have played with you long enough.\nToday we begin to toy with your SP ship.\nDrink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.\"\n  \n \n  Weak though he was Jon lunged to his\nfeet, spilling the tumbler of liquid.

The SP ship should now\nbe within range of the set. The space patrol\nwas notorious for its accuracy in keeping to\nschedule. Seconds counted like years. They\nhad to be on the nose, or it meant disaster\nor death.\n  \n \n  He sent out the call letters.\n  \n \n  \"AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ... AX\nto SP-101 ...\"\n  \n \n  Three times he sent the call, then began\nsending his message, hoping that his signal\nwas reaching the ship. He couldn't know if\nthey answered. Though the power pack\ncould get out a message over a vast distance,\nit could not pick up messages even\nwhen backed by an SP ship's power unless\nthe ship was only a few hundred miles\naway.\n  \n \n  The power pack was strictly a distress\nsignal.\n  \n \n  He didn't know how long he'd been\nsending, nor how many times his weary\nvoice had repeated the short but desperate\nmessage.\n  \n \n  He kept watching the heavens and hoping.\n  \n \n  Abruptly he knew the SP ship was coming,\nfor the blue ship of the Steel-Blues was\nrising silently from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Up and up it rose, then flames flickered\nin a circle about its curious shape. The ship\ndisappeared, suddenly accelerating.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl strained his eyes.\n  \n \n  Finally he looked away from the heavens\nto the two Steel-Blues who stood negligently\noutside the goldfish bowl.\n  \n \n  Once more, Jon used the stubray pistol.\nHe marched out of the plastic igloo and ran\ntoward the service station.\n  \n \n  He didn't know how weak he was until\nhe stumbled and fell only a few feet from\nhis prison.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues just watched him.\n  \n \n  He crawled on, around the circular pit in\nthe sward of the asteroid where one Steel-Blue\nhad shown him the power of his\nweapon.\n  \n \n  He'd been crawling through a nightmare\nfor years when the quiet voice penetrated\nhis dulled mind.\n  \n \n  \"Take it easy, Karyl. You're among\nfriends.\"\n  \n \n  He pried open his eyes with his will. He\nsaw the blue and gold of a space guard's\nuniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness."}

They're very active here.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's an idea,\" said Retief. \"Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke\ninstead of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to\nstep forward.

{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_2","contents":"Magnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n  \n \n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n  \n \n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n  \n \n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\""}
{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_3","contents":"The youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n  \n \n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n  \n \n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n  \n \n  \"The police\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's behind it?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate."}
{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_4","contents":"The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n  \n \n  \"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n  \n \n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n  \n \n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n  \n \n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n  \n \n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n  \n \n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n  \n \n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n  \n \n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n  \n \n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard."}
{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_5","contents":"The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here?

But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci.

There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here.

Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\""}
{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_6","contents":"A stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him.

He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n  \n \n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n   \n   Lament of\nHatching\n   \n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n  \n \n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n  \n \n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\""}

The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n  \n \n  \"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n  \n \n  \"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall.

He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\n  \n \n  Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n  \n \n  \"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  With a bellow Slock reached for Retief\u2014and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  blew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them.

This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\n  \n \n  Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\n  \n \n  Retief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\n  \n \n  In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n  \n \n  \"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\""}
{"id":"AIDE_MEMOIRE_8","contents":"In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue.

The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel.

There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught\u2014and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly.

Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?"}
{"id":"AMBITION_2","contents":"He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in\nthe details, he had the impression that there was something wrong\nabout it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no\nstraight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in\nfeatureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal,\nhalf ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table,\nbuilt apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression\nof arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish\ndesign, something about the room still was not right.\n  \n \n  His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer\none. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this\none, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He\npressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at\nthe disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.\n  \n \n  There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of\ncausing it to open.\n  \n \n  Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window\u2014and\nrealized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.\n  \n \n  It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....\n  \n \n  Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently\nbanged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then\nreached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff\nso transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!\nGlass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he\nhadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.\n  \n \n  He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character\nof the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became\naware that he was hungry.\n  \n \n  Where the devil could this place be? And\u2014muscles tightened about his\nempty stomach\u2014what was in store for him here?\n  \n \n  He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless,\nuntil a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew\nhis attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his\neyes to see what it was.\n  \n \n  A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they\nhad been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his\nneck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.\n  \n \n  Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he\ndidn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time\nof year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look\nScandinavian....\n  \n \n  As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans\nand showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained\nfor years with weights. They vanished below his field of view,\npresumably into the building.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor."}
{"id":"AMBITION_3","contents":"About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the\nwall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and\nsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood\nup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he\nmade an unimpressive figure.\n  \n \n  The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed\nwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.\nThe dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from\nswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\n  \n \n  This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of\nhimself.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head\nof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete\u2014an unusual combination.\n  \n \n  Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where\nyou are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but\notherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth\nto protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the\nguessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n  \n \n  \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have\nthree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to\nleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in\nany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that\nwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart\njumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I\nwant to give you some psychological tests....\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this\nmoment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll\nadmit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here\u2014but it\nseems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give\nyour tests to.\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now,\ncome with me.\""}
{"id":"AMBITION_4","contents":"After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather\ncommonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and\na bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple\nof them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal\ncomplement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran\nacross the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the\ncenter of the room.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,\n\"Understand one thing\u2014the more you cooperate, the easier things will\nbe for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results\nagainst your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an\nanswer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie\ndetector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I\ngive you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed\nmuscles. \"Make me.\"\n  \n \n  If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\"\nhe said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if\nyou'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland shook his head stubbornly.\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"\n  \n \n  He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the\nsolar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.\nHe felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on\nthe cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across\nhis chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a\nclamp that held his head immovable.\n  \n \n \n \n  Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and\nto other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to\nthe skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung\nfrom the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around\nhis left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box\nclamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined\nthe others.\n  \n \n  So\u2014Maitland thought\u2014Swarts could record changes in his skin\npotential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of\nthe body to stimuli.\n  \n \n  The question was, what were the stimuli to be?\n  \n \n  \"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four\nyears old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly\nas applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to\nquestion you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is\nMadison, Wisconsin....\"\n  \n \n  \"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly,\nlooking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not know everything about you\u2014yet. And I'm testing the\nequipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your\nfavorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science\nfiction. Maitland,\n   \n   how would you like to go to the Moon\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and\nhe tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do\nyou mean?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there,\ndidn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants\nto go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out\n   \n   why\n   \n  .\""}
{"id":"AMBITION_5","contents":"In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid\naside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for\nseveral seconds.\n  \n \n  She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that\nglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of\nblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless\nblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her\nbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what\nseemed to be white wool.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like\nexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down\nself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\n  \n \n \n \n  She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak\nbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed\ndoor for a minute after she was gone.\n  \n \n  Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded\ncarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his\nstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset\nand to think.\n  \n \n  There were three questions for which he required answers before he\ncould formulate any plan or policy.\n  \n \n  Where was he?\n  \n \n  Who was Swarts?\n  \n \n  What was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\n  \n \n  It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme\nfor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the\ncontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the\nappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been\nnothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from\nforeign intelligence officers.\n  \n \n  It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at\nthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to\nthink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there\nwas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be\ncultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\n  \n \n  This might be somewhere in Africa....\n  \n \n  He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued\nglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get\nhold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.\nAfter a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,\na backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,\nMaitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of\npeace and an undefinable longing.\n  \n \n  Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.\n  \n \n  Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the\nconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he\nhad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,\nits transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the\nhorizon, and loved it equally in its\n   \n   alter ego\n   \n  of morning star. Venus\nwas an old friend. An old friend....\n  \n \n  Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and\ndiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists\nclenched, forgetting to breathe.\n  \n \n  Last night Venus hadn't been there.\n  \n \n  Venus was a morning star just now....\n  \n \n \n   Just now!\n   \n \n \n  He realized the truth in that moment."}
{"id":"AMBITION_6","contents":"Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed."}
{"id":"AMBITION_7","contents":"He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n  \n \n  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n  \n \n  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n  \n \n  \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n  \n \n  \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n  \n \n  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut."}
{"id":"AMBITION_8","contents":"Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned\noffensive.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he\nstated.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to\nget through this morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.\nVenus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an\nevening star.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that. Come.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the\nlaboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach\nthe instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started\nsaying a list of words\u2014doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction\ntest\u2014Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc\n  3\n  x dx\" in his head.\nIt was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent\ntracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts\nhad stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man\nstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n  \n \n  \"We'll try another series of tests.\"\n  \n \n  It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He\nlowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks\nof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at\nthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's\neyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n  \n \n  \"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can\nblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down\nagainst the tension.\"\n  \n \n  He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears\u2014\n  \n \n  And then the show began.\n  \n \n  He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were\nfootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,\nand outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a\ntwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you\nwife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.\nThere was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless\npowder\u2014then blackness.\n  \n \n  With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to\nslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test\u2014what was the\ncountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them\ndeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\n  \n \n  Now he was looking at a girl. She....\n  \n \n  Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\n  \n \n  He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day\nafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had\nall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no\nmore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of\nSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this\nnew world.\n  \n \n  Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened\nagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his\nforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\n  \n \n  The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.\nThere was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and\nswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\n  \n \n  The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his\neyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at\nhim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was\nstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland's smile became a grin."}
{"id":"AMBITION_9","contents":"\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said\na while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.\nIf you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n  \n \n  \"Ching?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me\n   \n   you're\n   \n  from another time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much\nbehind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old\ntongue.\""}
{"id":"AMBITION_10","contents":"He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n  \n \n  His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n  \n \n  \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So many? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n  \n \n  \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\""}

Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ?

She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to.

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\n  \n \n  It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\n  \n \n  Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\n  \n \n  Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_2","contents":"Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he\ninstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate\nlevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as\nquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\n  \n \n  Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\n  \n \n  It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\n  \n \n  He set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\n  \n \n  Dear Fellow Scientist:\n  \n \n  A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space.

{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_3","contents":"Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed\nabove the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in\nthe Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,\nindicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair\non a boom.\n  \n \n  Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information\nand questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not\nresist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great\ncryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its\nown controls\u2014the permissible ones\u2014and could doubtless improvise a\nhearing apparatus if it wanted to.\n  \n \n  For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and\nManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.\nThis was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human\nbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the\nrims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney\nIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had\ngiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This\nwas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased\nhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.\n  \n \n \n   This was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!\n   \n \n \n  This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy\nprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the\nmachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,\n   \n   had\n   \n  built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and\ngirl-fondness, \"Maizie.\"\n  \n \n  Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chord\nplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and\nshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,\nalthough his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with\nthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet\ninfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape\nthe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_4","contents":"The grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\n  \n \n  The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\n  \n \n  The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\n   \n   guru\n   \n  , his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\n  \n \n  The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_5","contents":"The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\n  \n \n  Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\n  \n \n  The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\n  \n \n  Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\n  \n \n  The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\n  \n \n  Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\n  \n \n  From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_6","contents":"Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n  \n \n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n  \n \n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n  \n \n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n  \n \n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n  \n \n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_7","contents":"Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\n  \n \n  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\n  \n \n  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\n  \n \n  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\n  \n \n  The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\n  \n \n  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he began to tape again.\n  \n \n  \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name.

{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_8","contents":"Five hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off\nits fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it\neffortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped\nhimself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the\ndried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew\nhe had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more\nthan that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.\n  \n \n  Used to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the\nfluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and\ngyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and\nparlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of\nfree fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would\ntoss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes\nshe swam for it frantically.\n  \n \n  After a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer\nand began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on\nMars this trip\u2014priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to\nwar-battered mankind.\n  \n \n  The cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up\non the air, and went to sleep."}
{"id":"Appointment_in_Tomorrow_9","contents":"Jorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed\neach to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away\nwith little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over\nhis.\n  \n \n  \"Who the devil would Maelzel be?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  A remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. \"Edgar\nAllen Poe,\" he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.\n  \n \n  The grizzled general snapped his fingers. \"Sure! Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess.

Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times.

Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\n  \n \n  The two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought.

No more ridiculous business of using a reactor to drive a\nsteam engine, or boil off something for a jet exhaust\u2014processes that\nwere as primitive and wasteful as burning gunpowder to keep yourself\nwarm.\n  \n \n  Chemical jets would carry his spaceship above the atmosphere. Then\nwould come the thrilling order, \"Set sail for Mars!\" The vast umbrella\nwould unfold and open out around the stern, its rear or Earthward side\na gleaming expanse of radioactive ribbon perhaps only an atom thick\nand backed with a material that would reflect neutrons. Atoms in the\nribbon would split, blasting neutrons astern at fantastic velocities.\nReaction would send the spaceship hurtling forward.\n  \n \n  In airless space, the expanse of sails would naturally not retard the\nship. More radioactive ribbon, manufactured as needed in the ship\nitself, would feed out onto the sail as that already there became\nexhausted.\n  \n \n  A spaceship with direct nuclear drive\u2014and he, a Thinker, had\nconceived it completely except for the technical details! Having\nstrengthened his mind by hard years of somno-learning, mind-casting,\nmemory-straightening, and sensory training, he had assured himself\nof the executive power to control the technicians and direct their\nspecialized abilities. Together they would build the true Mars rocket.\n  \n \n  But that would only be a beginning. They would build the true Mind\nBomb. They would build the true Selective Microbe Slayer.

They would even\u2014his\nimagination hesitated a moment, then strode boldly forward\u2014build the\ntrue Maizie!\n  \n \n  And then ... then the Thinkers would be on even terms with the\nscientists.

He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\ndelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\nocean at last.\n  \n \n  When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\nsign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\nof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\nto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n  \n \n  \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\nwhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\nsome object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\nthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\nHe shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\nclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\nhow tall the trees really were.\n  \n \n  His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\nthe milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\nhad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\nits transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\nheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\nnimbi.\n  \n \n  With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\nhurried toward the ocean.\n  \n \n  If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to\nsee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\nthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\nbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\nremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\nas he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\nwere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\nplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\nthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\nkinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n  \n \n  He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\nday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this\nhis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\neven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\nwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n  \n \n  \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\nthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\ncare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When\nPurnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures he\nmet\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as\nsoon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off."}
{"id":"BEACH_SCENE_2","contents":"When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\noff, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\nclearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\nhad been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\nfar from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\nhour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\nHe chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\ntime without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n  \n \n  He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\nwhen they learned of his brave journey.\n  \n \n  The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\ngather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\nduring this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\ndozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n  \n \n  He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n  \n \n  He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\nout as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\nawaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\nthe shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\nexploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\norange curls waiting to start that action.\n  \n \n  And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\nfrozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\nheard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\nin school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\nbeach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\nthe spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\nmore, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\nanimation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\nnothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\ntripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\nof munching seaweed.\n  \n \n  \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\nhe himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\ntime-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\ncontinue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time."}
{"id":"BEACH_SCENE_3","contents":"\"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he\nexpected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\nactivity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\nthe dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\ncontinue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n  \n \n  He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\npicked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\ntheir leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\npollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\ndelicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\ninterrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\nwith continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\nnot the world around him.\n  \n \n  He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\ntripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n  \n \n  \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\nbottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\nposition. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\ndone, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\nmark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n  \n \n  The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long\nenough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\nrepast.\n  \n \n  Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\nonce. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\nto a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\nthe two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\nthere!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n  \n \n  \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson.

Let the men\nlook around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n  \n \n  As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\nwill you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\njoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\nhe got an upside down view of them walking away.\n  \n \n  He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\nWhat was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\nmore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\ntrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\nhis lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n  \n \n  Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\nwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\nvicinity.

{"id":"BEACH_SCENE_7","contents":"Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n  \n \n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n  \n \n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n  \n \n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n  \n \n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n  \n \n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n  \n \n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty."}

No matter what their condition\nof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\nhe started time again.

Up on the beach, he\nstarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\nHe removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\nposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\nAnother, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\na new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\nchaotic scene before him.\n  \n \n  At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\nhim.\n  \n \n  He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\ntime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\nhim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\nhe knew he must first resume time.\n  \n \n  Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\nto consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\nlate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\nknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n  \n \n  Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\ntime to resume, nothing happened.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\nthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\nwanted to see them safe.\n  \n \n  He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no\n   \n   urging\n   \n  time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,\nfirst slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't.

It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\nhundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\nfew of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\nactually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\nstretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n  \n \n  \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\nStone Age aren't related to anything else there.

If they ever got\ntogether\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n  \n \n  Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\nvery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\nhelping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\nprinciple?\" asked Sam Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\nthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\nWe've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\nrace F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\nfertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\ntheir positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\nwas a little further along. When we project back into time those star\nsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\npattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n  \n \n  The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly.

He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n  \n \n  Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\nwas the most advanced human type present, but while there were\ndifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\nas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\nthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\nlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\nthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\nthis was Kelburn's first trip.

The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\nhim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\nmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\nus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\nhave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\nwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\nhave an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\nability.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\nplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\nsuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\nthe incentives?\"\n  \n \n  Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\nRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\ncent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\nprofits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\nyou'll take my contract.

Besides, the\nintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n  \n \n  \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\nfor me.

It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n  \n \n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n  \n \n  \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n  \n \n  And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?"}
{"id":"BIG_ANCESTOR_8","contents":"Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this\ndiscovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n  \n \n  It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing\nwhere we came from.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment\nwas required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational\ninstitutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual\ncuriosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?\nWhen a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than\nphysiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Things\nthat were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n  \n \n  \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in\ncultural discoveries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced\ncivilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've\nachieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\n\"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,\nbut wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n  \n \n  Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,\nworking directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and\nproduced us. They\n   \n   were\n   \n  master biologists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your\nfantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built\nup a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling\nfractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk\nusing bait for your pest.\"\n  \n \n  He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's\nconsent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been\nbothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer\ncontract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n  \n \n  \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as\nmuch as you think you will. The difference is this:\n   \n   My\n   \n  terms don't\npermit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding\nanything. Halden examined his own attitudes.\n   \n   He\n   \n  hadn't intended, but\ncould he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?\nHe couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquired\nwould have to be shared.\n  \n \n  That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind of\ntechnical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could\nimprove itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start\nthat could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now."}

Keep noise at\na minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them\nexactly.\"\n  \n \n  At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape\ncrept out.

It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n  \n \n  Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the\nside of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began\nnibbling what it could reach.\n  \n \n  Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another\nshape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one\nretreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped\nand the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up\nand mauled the other unmercifully.\n  \n \n \n \n  It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it\nbacked off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.\nThen it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within\nreach, it climbed into the branches.\n  \n \n  The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging\nitself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no\nnoise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying\naway, still within range of the screen.\n  \n \n  Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top\nand there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed\naround and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as\nit snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent\ndefeat.\n  \n \n  This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and\nlanded on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal\nheard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping\nthe last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n  \n \n  The small one stood still till the last instant\u2014and then a paw\nflickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of\nthe charging creature.

To\nher, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n  \n \n  They went to his cabin.\n  \n \n  She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\nwasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\nlong and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\nexcept for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\nthe difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\ndevelopment, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\nthe violet end of the spectrum.\n  \n \n  She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\nprimeval Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\nher own world. She had something else in mind.\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\nthem start lower than I am?\"\n  \n \n  The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\nit governed personal relations between races that were united against\nnon-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n  \n \n  \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n  \n \n  It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\npermanent union.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it\nlead me astray.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific\nabout it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't\nlike him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n  \n \n  \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.\nThere's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\""}

She nuzzled against him and his reaction\nwas purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh\ngive when his knuckles struck it.\n  \n \n  She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took\nit away, blood spurted.

She had no concept of love outside of\nthe physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage\u2014what\nadvantage?\u2014for the children she intended to have.

But you'll have to watch out whose children\nI have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n  \n \n  The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not\ncompletely her fault. Besides....\n  \n \n  Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior\nchildren\u2014and they might be his.\n  \n \n  He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was.

The Galaxy is full of bizarre\nbeings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old\nexhibitionist urge.\n  \n \n  \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the\noffice, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to\nbegin.\n  \n \n  The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official\nTerran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were\naccustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV\nand referred to it publicly as Ghryne.

So did\nthe light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in\nthe gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the\nhumans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and\narrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior\nto anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was\naccustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was\nalmost ordinary-looking.\n  \n \n  As for the extraterrestrials\u2014it was a free bar\u2014they were merely\namused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably\nhideous.\n  \n \n  Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures.

As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see."}
{"id":"Bodyguard_4","contents":"There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,\nwhich was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and\nhis was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket\ncloser about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your\u2014your\nfriend to me, Gabe?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's\nno friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification\ncard from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and\nDominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail\nmilgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks\nago, and now he isn't ... anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token\nof my\u2014of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier\nwith deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only\ncasually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation\nheld little gratitude.\n  \n \n  The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money,\nthank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\n\"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the\nfuture! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let\nsomething happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\n  \n \n  Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise\u2014I'll be\ncareful.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,\nthe fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi\ndriver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the\ncommission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others\nhad been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate\nor despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known\ncolloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from\none zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you\ncould call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it\nextended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.\nPerhaps\u2014and this was the most likely hypothesis\u2014he just didn't care.\n  \n \n  Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course\u2014so much so that there were\nmany legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word\nimplied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so\ndeliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\n\"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to\nzarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly\napplied. And this was one crime\u2014for it was crime in law as well as\nnature\u2014in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;\notherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse."}
{"id":"Bodyguard_5","contents":"Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it\nprofitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's\nseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\nhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\ninterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\nslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\nzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\nWhich was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\nbig money in musical chairs as such.\n  \n \n  When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\nthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\nlaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\ncould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\nspanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\npunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\nterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\ncould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\nafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\ntrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\nVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\nof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n  \n \n  The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\nwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\nconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\nBut the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\nof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\nlight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\nthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\ninvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n  \n \n  The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\nwhen profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\ndarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\nhave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\neverybody else far too well.\n  \n \n  The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\ncoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\ndisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\ntoo logical for the man he was haunting.\n  \n \n  However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\nheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\ncreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n  \n \n  \"One,\" the fat man answered.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\nfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\npatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\nfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\nGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\nweighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\ntwo to come out to a place like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"I really think Gabriel\n   \n   must\n   \n  be possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\nto herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\nuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\nIt almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\ngrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\nthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\nand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n  \n \n  The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nsame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\nthat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n  \n \n  The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\nwho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\nreached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\nhair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\nbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that."}
{"id":"Bodyguard_6","contents":"He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.\n  \n \n  \"But why do you do it?\n   \n   Why!\n   \n  Do you like it? Or is it because of\nGabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here\nand she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was\nincluded in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;\nis that it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him.\"\n  \n \n  \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I\ndidn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what\nwe've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I\nthink?\"\n  \n \n  There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she\nwondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or\nthird- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it\nrespond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she\nmust not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking\nfor a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,\nshe thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so\ncasually."}
{"id":"Bodyguard_7","contents":"It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her\nhusband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat\u2014of fur taken from\nsome animal who had lived and died light-years away\u2014more closely about\nherself. The thin young man began to cough again.\n  \n \n  Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk\nof the Moon and hurl itself upward\u2014one of the interstellar ships\nembarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow\nshe could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a\nbarren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who\nfollowed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of\nthem would stay....\n  \n \n  \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then\ndo you keep helping him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am not helping\n   \n   him\n   \n  . And he knows that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always\nchange after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to\nidentify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's\nsomething about you that doesn't change.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed\nhim for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out\nfrom the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice\nless impersonal, \"for your sake.\"\n  \n \n  She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but\nshe would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an\noutsider; he was part of their small family group\u2014as long as she had\nknown Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect\nthat he was even more closely involved than that.\n  \n \n  \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the\nsubject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the\nrisk of getting a bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's\nsupposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical\nexamination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading\nme, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty\nof foliage.\"\n  \n \n  \"How\u2014long will it last you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if\nthat's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be\nexpensive\u2014that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then\nit was tough on me too, wasn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why\nare you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard\nfor fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should\nknow him better than most.\n  \n \n  \"Ask your husband.\"\n  \n \n  The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,\nsnow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,\nand stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call a cab\u2014he might freeze to\ndeath.\"\n  \n \n  He signaled and a cab came.\n  \n \n  \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver\nlifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I'm\ngetting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.\n\"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,\nin the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\""}
{"id":"Bodyguard_8","contents":"\"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect\nexcept for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you\ncannot play.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.\n  \n \n  \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz\nshrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\"\n  \n \n  The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This\ngame is really clean.\"\n  \n \n  \"In a town like this?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils\nquivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through\nlong, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His\nheavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been\nvelvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung\nwith him.\n  \n \n  \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole\nset-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by\nno means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don't you try another\ntown where they're not so particular?\"\n  \n \n  The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.\nHe never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.\nAnd even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he\nwouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was\nhe changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own\ndiscoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact\nthat none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?\nWas he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the\nhazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day\nwin another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original\ncasing had?\n  \n \n  He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he\nwould have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl,\nseeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened\nand tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that\nthe hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand\nhow he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of\ninformation."}
{"id":"Bodyguard_9","contents":"The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they\ndetached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it\nhappens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions\nto be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good\nhealth.\"\n  \n \n  The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured\naloud. \"A criminal then.\"\n  \n \n  The green one's face\u2014if you could call it a face\u2014remained impassive.\n  \n \n  \"Male?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate\nstandards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the\ncurious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it\nkept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had\nalso never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials\nexchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or\nbiological impossibility, no one could tell.\n  \n \n  It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part\u2014if it had ever\nbeen proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body,\nEarthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held\nits self-bestowed purity of birthright dear\u2014and the Vinzz, despite\nbeing unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had\nbeen undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on\nTerra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,\n\"Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take\nsuch a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thirty thousand credits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, that's three times the usual rate!\"\n  \n \n  \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific\nrisk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he\nhimself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all\nthe crimes it had committed.

Not that it\nwas a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\nstudent of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\ntime immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\nmight one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\nthe men depicted there.

There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n  \n \n \n   Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school.\n   \n \n \n  He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n  \n \n  She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh?

It'll be Timkins,\nwho took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\"\n  \n \n  She began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They\nhad no son, never had a son. And Timkins\u2014he'd died and they'd gone to\nhis funeral. Or so Edna said.\n  \n \n  He himself just couldn't remember it.\n  \n \n  He went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a\ndream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last\nnight, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all\nthe new regulations and not working regular. I never meant we had a\nson.\" He waited then, hoping she'd say they\n   \n   had\n   \n  had a son, and he'd\ndied or gone away. But of course she didn't."}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_2","contents":"He went to the bathroom and washed. By the time he came to the kitchen,\nEdna had hotcakes on a plate and coffee in a cup. He sat down and ate.\nPart way through the meal, he paused. \"Got an awful craving for meat,\"\nhe said. \"Goddam those rations! Man can't even butcher his own stock\nfor his own table!\"\n  \n \n  \"We're having meat for lunch,\" she said placatingly. \"Nice cut of\nmulti-pro.\"\n  \n \n  \"Multi-pro,\" he scoffed. \"God knows what's in it. Like spam put through\na grinder a hundred times and then baked into slabs. Can't hardly taste\nany meat there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we got no choice. Country's on emergency rations. The current\ncrisis, you know.\"\n  \n \n  The way she said it irritated him. Like it was Scripture; like no one\ncould question one word of it without being damned to Hell. He finished\nquickly and without speaking went on out to the barn.\n  \n \n  He milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and still was done inside\nof two hours. Then he walked slowly, head down, across the hay-strewn\nfloor. He stopped, put out his hand as if to find a pole or beam that\nwas too familiar to require raising his eyes, and almost fell as he\nleaned in that direction. Regaining his balance after a sideward\nstaggering shuffle, he looked around, startled. \"Why, this ain't the\nway I had my barn....\"\n  \n \n  He heard his own voice, and stopped. He fought the flash of senseless\npanic. Of course this was the way he'd had his barn built, because it\n   \n   was\n   \n  his barn!\n  \n \n  He rubbed his hard hands together and said aloud, \"Get down to the\npatch. Them tomatoes need fertilizer for tang.\" He walked outside and\ntook a deep breath. Air was different, wasn't it? Sweet and pure and\nclean, like country air always was and always would be; but still,\ndifferent somehow. Maybe sharper. Or was sharp the word? Maybe....\n  \n \n  He went quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen\u2014he'd had twelve\npigs, hadn't he? Now he had four\u2014behind the house to where the\nhalf-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. Sometime\nlater, Edna called to him. \"Delivery last night, Harry. I took some.\nPick up rest?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" he shouted.\n  \n \n  She disappeared.\n  \n \n  He walked slowly back to the house. As he came into the front yard,\nmoving toward the road and the supply bin, something occurred to him.\n   \n   The car.\n   \n  He hadn't seen the old Chevvy in ... how long? It'd be nice\nto take a ride to town, see a movie, maybe have a few beers.\n  \n \n  No. It was against the travel regulations. He couldn't go further than\nWalt and Gloria Shanks' place. They couldn't go further than his. And\nthe gas rationing. Besides, he'd sold the car, hadn't he? Because it\nwas no use to him lying in the tractor shed."}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_3","contents":"He whirled, staring out across the fields to his left. Why, the tractor\nshed had stood just fifty feet from the house!\n  \n \n  No, he'd torn it down. The tractor was in town, being overhauled and\nall. He was leaving it there until he had use for it.\n  \n \n  He went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. Why should\na man his age, hardly sick at all since he was a kid, suddenly start\nlosing hold this way? Edna was worried. The Shanks had noticed it too.\n  \n \n  He was at the supply bin\u2014like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with\na sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines\nand other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and\nthey left it\u2014or whatever they allowed you\u2014with a bill. You paid the\nbill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt\nand your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some\nmoney from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn.\nIt came out just about even.\n  \n \n  He hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had\nordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit Medicine Shelf. He carried it\ninto the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. A\ntelevision program guide.\n  \n \n  Edna hustled over excitedly. \"Anything good on this week, Harry?\"\n  \n \n  He looked down the listings, and frowned. \"All old movies. Still only\none channel. Still only from nine to eleven at night.\" He gave it to\nher, turned away; then stopped and waited. He'd said the same thing\nlast week. And she had said the films were all new to her.\n  \n \n  She said it now. \"Why Harry, I've never seen this movie with Clark\nGable. Nor the comedy with Red Skeleton. Nor the other five neither.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm gonna lie down,\" he said flatly. He turned and stepped forward,\nand found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the\nstove. \"But the door....\" he began. He cut himself short. He turned and\nsaw the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He went there\nand out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren't right)\nand into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The bed was\nwrong. The windows were wrong.\n  \n \n  The world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world was wrong!"}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_4","contents":"Edna didn't wake him, so they had a late lunch. Then he went back to\nthe barn and let the four cows and four sheep and two horses into the\npastures. Then he checked to see that Edna had fed the chickens right.\nThey had only a dozen or so now.\n  \n \n  When had he sold the rest? And when had he sold his other livestock?\n  \n \n  Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease?\n  \n \n  He stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face\nthat had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and\nlean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and\nwent to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to\nregulations\u2014one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water\ntwice a week.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be\nshowing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our\nlivestock, Edna?\"\n  \n \n  \"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\"\n  \n \n  He remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went\nupstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them,\nand all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was\nglad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs.\n  \n \n  He washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were\nsitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd\ngotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply\nbin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the\nbook of directions.\"\n  \n \n  Harry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked\nabout TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book\nnext week.\"\n  \n \n  \"She's five already?\" Harry asked.\n  \n \n  \"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that\nthe child should be five years nine months old before embarking on\nkindergarten book.\"\n  \n \n  \"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting\nhigh....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because\nhe couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing\nand rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\""}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_5","contents":"They ate in the kitchen. They talked\u2014or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt\ndid. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing.\n  \n \n  Walt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the\ndoor and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about\nDoctor Hamming.\n  \n \n  He was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying.\n\"Harry, please see the doctor.\"\n  \n \n  He got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\"\n  \n \n  \"But why, Harry, why?\"\n  \n \n  He couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet\ncheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so, Harry.\"\n  \n \n  He left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He\nlooked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a\nbright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road\nwas empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over\nfrom their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty.\nOnce there'd been cars, people....\n  \n \n  He had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't\nhelp him. He had to go somewhere, see someone.\n  \n \n  He went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But\nhe'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he?\n  \n \n  He threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of\nwash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find\nthat either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved\nout of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town.\n  \n \n  Then he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be\nreported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't\nknow what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine.\n  \n \n  He cut into an unfenced, unplanted field.\n  \n \n  His headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire\nhead throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's\nmane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved\nforward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to\nleave his headache and confusion behind.\n  \n \n  He didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He\nraised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off\nto the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached\nthe gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton\nFarm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his\nhead, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north.\nHe'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he\nwas leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers.\nWho was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But\nanything like that would've gotten around.\n  \n \n  Was he forgetting again?"}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_6","contents":"Well, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He\nopened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and\nrode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after\nthe Pangborns the biggest farm in the county\u2014old Wallace Elverton's\nplace. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed\nas if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get\nalong without crops for years more.\n  \n \n  He looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure\nwhy, but ... everything was wrong.\n  \n \n  His head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went\nsedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another\nfence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by\nthree feet of barbed-wire\u2014five separate strands. What in the world had\nSam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this?\n  \n \n  He looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way.\nHe found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but\nfence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back.\nYes, there\n   \n   was\n   \n  a slight inward curve.\n  \n \n  He dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured\nthe best way to get to the other side.\n  \n \n  The best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they\nused to say back when he was a kid.\n  \n \n \n \n  It took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got\nover and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed\nbeneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand.\nHe'd never seen the like of it in this county.\n  \n \n  He walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He\nlistened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure\nhe was heading in the right direction.\n  \n \n  And the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring.\n  \n \n  Flooring!\n  \n \n  He knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and\nglanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a\nsick laugh, so he stopped it.\n  \n \n  He took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked.\nMore wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound\ngrowing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had\nbefore in Cultwait County."}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_7","contents":"His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n  \n \n  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n  \n \n  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n  \n \n  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n  \n \n  It was getting light. His head was splitting.\n  \n \n  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n  \n \n \n   Town!\n   \n  He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n  \n \n  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately\u2014a long time\nlately?\n  \n \n \n   The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that....\n   \n \n \n  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n  \n \n  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his\nvoice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get\nyou!\""}
{"id":"BREAKDOWN_8","contents":"He rode on. He came to another house, neat and white, with three\nchildren playing on a grassy lawn. They saw him and ran inside.

He's headin' foah Piney Woods!\"\n  \n \n  There was no place called Piney Woods in this county.\n  \n \n  Was this how a man's mind went?\n  \n \n  He came to another house, and another.

He got off Plum and ripped his\nclothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood,\nand came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming\nin bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth\nsway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and\nshook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and\nwent back to the fence and heard a sound.

But who was his enemy?\n  \n \n \n  In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was\nknown as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was known\nas smog. By 2349, it was fog again.\n  \n \n  But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.\nSomewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.\n  \n \n  He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the\ncracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;\nwhat remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he\npeered was fire-proof.\n  \n \n  But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke\nin from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while\nthe soldiers went out to fight.\n  \n \n  And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt\nalmost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in\nthat grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, \"The soldiers\ndon't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The soldiers don't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The\nsoldiers don't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  a little boy!\" Roddie suddenly shouted. \"I'm full-grown and\nI've never even\n   \n   seen\n   \n  an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?\"\n  \n \n  Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder.\nShe rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.\n  \n \n  \"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse\u2014\" she chanted.\n  \n \n  Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that had\nhelped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped the\nkindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.\n  \n \n  \"Wuzzums hungry?\" Molly cooed, still rocking.\n  \n \n  Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.\n  \n \n  It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had\ncared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a\nmechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_2","contents":"He was still tinkering when the soldiers came in. While they lined up\nalong the wall, he put Molly's head back on her neck.\n  \n \n  She gaped coyly at the new arrivals. \"Hello, boys,\" she simpered.\n\"Looking for a good time?\"\n  \n \n  Roddie slapped her to silence, reflecting briefly that there were many\nthings he didn't know about Molly. But there was work to be done.\nCarefully he framed the ritual words she'd taught him: \"Soldiers, come\nto attention and report!\"\n  \n \n  There were eleven of them, six feet tall, with four limbs and eight\nextremities. They stood uniformly, the thumbs on each pair of hands\ntouching along the center line of the legs, front feet turned out at an\nangle of forty-five degrees, rear feet turned inward at thirty degrees.\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" they chorused, \"we have met the enemy and he is ours.\"\n  \n \n  He inspected them. All were scratched and dented, but one in particular\nseemed badly damaged. His left arm was almost severed at the shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Come here, fellow,\" Roddie said. \"Let's see if I can fix that.\"\n  \n \n  The soldier took a step forward, lurched suddenly, stopped, and whipped\nout a bayonet.\n  \n \n  \"Death to Invaders!\" he yelled, and charged crazily.\n  \n \n \n  Molly stepped in front of him.\n  \n \n  \"You aren't being very nice to my baby,\" she murmured, and thrust her\nknitting needles into his eyes.\n  \n \n  Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft\nspot on his conical skull. The soldier collapsed to the floor."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_3","contents":"Roddie salvaged and returned Molly's needles. Then he examined the\npatient, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock.\n  \n \n  It was lucky he did. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off\nthe floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached\nat the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught\nand could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another\nharmlessly.\n  \n \n \n  Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another\ncasualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. By the\ntime Roddie had hauled him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie\nswore, then decided to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces\nof the other to make a whole one.\n  \n \n  To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was\nnew at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the\nsoldiers melt away, gradually succumbing to battle damage, shamed\nhim to see the empty ruins burn section by section as the Invaders\nrepeatedly broke through and had to be burned out.\n  \n \n  Soon there would be nothing left of the\n   \n   Private Property Keep Out\n   \n  that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to\nthem when driven away by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers themselves\nwould be gone. None would remain to guard the city but a few strayed\nservants like Molly, and an occasional Civil Defender.\n  \n \n  And himself, Roddie reflected, spitting savagely into the fire. He\nmight remain. But how he fitted into the picture, he didn't know. And\nMolly, who claimed to have found him in the ruins after a fight with\nInvaders twenty years before, couldn't or wouldn't say.\n  \n \n  Well, for as long as possible, Roddie decided, he'd do his duty as\nthe others did theirs\u2014single-mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might\naccept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first\naid was useful to them.\n  \n \n  He gave the fire a final poke and then paused, wondering if, when\nheated, his screwdriver could make an unfastened end of wire stick on\nthe grayish spot where it seemed to belong.\n  \n \n  Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his new\nidea, Roddie got too close to the flames. Instantly the room filled\nwith the stench of singed hair. Roddie drew angrily back, beating out\nthe sparks in his uncut blond mane.\n  \n \n  As he stood slapping his head and muttering, a deranged Civil Defense\nfirefighter popped into the doorway and covered him with carbon dioxide\nfoam.\n  \n \n  Roddie fled. His life-long friends were not merely wearing out, they\nwere unbearably wearing."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_4","contents":"In the street, even before he'd wiped off the foam, he regretted\nhis flight. The fire was back home. And here in the cold of this\nfog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble,\nthe diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His\ncherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the\ndiaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from\na string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood\nirresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more\nfamiliar bedlam.\n  \n \n  But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was,\nthough she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger,\nthirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his\nfriends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were\nthings of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring\neyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide.\n  \n \n  Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite\ncomplete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light\non the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off,\nan owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and\nrustle as they scampered.\n  \n \n  The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as\nan irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even\nin the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the\nOne who'd built him must have been an apprentice.\n  \n \n  For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now\nwalked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of\nhow much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock\nitself a difference to be hidden.\n  \n \n  His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A\nweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was\nthe levering key that opened its door.\n  \n \n \n   Everything\n   \n  was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of\ncourse that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to\nmove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for\nventilation.\n  \n \n  But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry\nout every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all\nobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against\neverything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even\n   \n   him\n   \n  out\nwhen he was aflame....\n  \n \n  Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling.\nHe lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the\nstreet, and felt with his feet for the top rung.\n  \n \n  Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but\nsaw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could\nhave entered through the iron cover?\n  \n \n  He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.\n  \n \n  It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body\nheat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!"}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_5","contents":"Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n  \n \n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n  \n \n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n  \n \n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n   \n   you\n   \n  are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n   \n   are\n   \n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n  \n \n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n  \n \n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself...."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_6","contents":"\"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n  \n \n  But she'd see\n   \n   him\n   \n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\""}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_7","contents":"When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's\nassertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if\nshe felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of\nwhat the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an\nInvader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.\n  \n \n  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do\nany good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most\ndirect route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and\nshe began to talk.\n  \n \n  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless\nto him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had\nbeen.\n  \n \n  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many\ncasualties....\n  \n \n  \"But why do you\u2014we\u2014keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the\nsoldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and\nthey\n   \n   can't\n   \n  leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll\nbe plenty of young men.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever\ntell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep\nus out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our\ntools and things?\"\n  \n \n  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance.\nBut she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too\nclose for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder\nevery few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.\n  \n \n  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are\n   \n   you\n   \n  here? I mean, sure, the\nothers are after tools and things, but what's\n   \n   your\n   \n  purpose?\"\n  \n \n  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said,\n\"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no\nweapon.\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of\nwords. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored\nand hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the\nboats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was\nbeing silly?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"\n  \n \n  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and\nconcrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over\nthe water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they\ncould see the beginning of the bridge approach.\n  \n \n  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and\nclung to Roddie's arm.\n  \n \n  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"\n  \n \n  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back\nbelow the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a\nsoldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.\n  \n \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.\n  \n \n  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned\nand walked away.\n  \n \n  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie\nturned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to\nhis. He grimaced and turned away his head.\n  \n \n  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from\nhis arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've\nhad no sleep, no food or water.\"\n  \n \n  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to\ndeny his own humiliating needs.\n  \n \n  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care\nof you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"\n  \n \n  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he\nhad previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting\na pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had\ngrubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose.\nPicking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed\nan end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained\nspinach or squash.\n  \n \n  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat\nbaby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you\nhappen to know where to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging.\n\"I've been here before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"\n  \n \n  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She\nwas silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can\nwith rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the\nrubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her\nstrength.\n  \n \n  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed\nplainly that he'd given himself away.\n  \n \n  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the\nsupposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as\nIda herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would\nsatisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he\nmight join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this\nenemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect\nhim.\n  \n \n  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of\nhis watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder\nat every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for\nthis self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_8","contents":"He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only\nhis holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head."}
{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_9","contents":"She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her\nand looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced\nby the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in\nsight.\n  \n \n  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier\nhad ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left\nthe city, were not built to do so. But\n   \n   he\n   \n  was here; with luck, he\ncould capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.\n  \n \n  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened\nwire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.\n  \n \n  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.\nNever had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar\nnon-mechanical construction.\n  \n \n  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling\nas that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n  \n \n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n  \n \n  They were completely spent.

{"id":"Bridge_Crossing_10","contents":"Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n  \n \n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n  \n \n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n  \n \n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n  \n \n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength.

We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   can't\n   \n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n   \n   My\n   \n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n  \n \n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n  \n \n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n  \n \n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away.

Nourse\n  \n  JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\na visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\nhad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\nwere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\nhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousand\npardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave no\nname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back by\neight.\u201d\n  \n \n  Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\nabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\nRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\nnumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\nvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\nnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\nthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\nreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\nwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\nwithout justifying it.\n  \n \n  Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\ndown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\nno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014but\nhe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\nforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\nhealing.\n  \n \n  The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re\nplanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d\n  \n \n  Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can read\ntelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct.

There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d His\nfingers were trembling.\n  \n \n  Peter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything you\nwant to hear.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut you\u2019ve\n   \n   got\n   \n  to.

{"id":"Brightside_Crossing_2","contents":"I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\nI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\nWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\nI think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  \n \n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\na hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\ndangerous, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n  \n \n  I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along."}
{"id":"Brightside_Crossing_3","contents":"The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest."}

{"id":"Brightside_Crossing_5","contents":"We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\nwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\ncould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\nCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closest\napproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part of\nthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n  \n \n  The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\nwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\nthat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\nsurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\nwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel another\ntwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone.

Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\nyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job of\ndragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course pretty\nclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\nIf there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore ahead\non foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack\nand I were planning to change around. We figured he could\ntake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,\nJack?\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does\nit make any difference?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank\nPeter along with me. Right?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going\nto do the advance scouting?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead\nBug light as possible.\u201d\n  \n \n  Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down\nto the frame and wheels.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the\n   \n   advance\n   \n  work.\nYou need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to\npick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort of\na hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\nahead?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said\nsharply.\n  \n \n  \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about\n   \n   detail\n   \n  work. We don\u2019t need to\nworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you\ncan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts\ndown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\nreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\nI can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\narea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\nThen\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When\nwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\nmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\nclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\nalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\ngave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.\nWe\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\nGot that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\nwe nodded, too.\n  \n \n  \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,\nlet\u2019s go.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll\nnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\nbreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\nfirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\nfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\nthe Twilight Lab.\n  \n \n  I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\nMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\ntaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\nStone dragged the sledges.\n  \n \n  Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\nthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\nash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\nthe first twenty miles.\n  \n \n  I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\nthe track the early research teams had made out into the edge\nof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s\nlittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\nwere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\nbite.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the heat so much those first days out. We\n   \n   saw\n   \n  it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\ndegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\nthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\nsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\nsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n  \n \n  We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\ncame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\na light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\nThe sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\ndegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\nforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,\nbulk gelatin, vitamins.\n  \n \n  The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\nwe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\nWe were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\nand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interesting\nreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\nhappened to be so.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\neyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\nbut we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around looking\nat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\ntaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothers\nfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n  \n \n  After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\nthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\nEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\nHuge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\nwith black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\nwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n  \n \n  It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\nthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\nhad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\ntried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\nso it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\nthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\ncould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n  \n \n  Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\nbefore, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold before\nand won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The only\nworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\nitself.\n  \n \n  Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\nget us. That was the bargain.\n  \n \n  I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\nThe gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\nonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\neast. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\non Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\ncones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\nsides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n  \n \n  We couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\nsulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\nface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\nrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\nrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\nfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\ndust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\nash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacherous\nsurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\n  \n \n  I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\nsag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\nfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\na halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\nlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\nuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\nwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\nat first.\n  \n \n  Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\nthink so, too.\n  \n \n  McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\nHe talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\ndriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\nwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\nnow and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n  \n \n  Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\neach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but\nI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\nenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n  \n \n  And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\nthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\nfilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\nconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\nend of an eight-hour trek.\n  \n \n  But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\ndown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\nroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\nheard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n  \n \n  I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\nspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\ntop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\nthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\nhorrible pictures racing through our minds....\n  \n \n  We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\nand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreck\nof a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\nhadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\nthe rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\nmiddle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\ntwo insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\nfiberglass helmets.\n  \n \n  This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\n   \n   their\n   \n  Brightside Crossing."}
{"id":"Brightside_Crossing_6","contents":"On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.\nIt looked the same, but every now and then it\n   \n   felt\n   \n  different.\nOn two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest\nfrom my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;\nI gunned my motor and nothing happened.\n  \n \n  I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,\nthick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as\nthe wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the\nwheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the\ntractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for\nall the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten\nlead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\n  \n \n  I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into\nan area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.\nI caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed\nMcIvers\u2019 scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for\nthe individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn\u2019t\nlike it.\n  \n \n  One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn\u2019t thinking\nmuch about the others. I was worried about\n   \n   me\n   \n  , plenty\nworried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.\nIt wasn\u2019t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t get the\nthought out of my mind.\n  \n \n  It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in\nthe Bug again, we moved still more slowly\u2014edging out on a\nbroad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks\u2014winding\nback and forth in an effort to keep the machines on\nsolid rock. I couldn\u2019t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze\nrising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw\na sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond\na deep crack.\n  \n \n  I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug\nforward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved\nfifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\n  \n \n  There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;\na long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across\na section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could\nfeel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the\nledge shift over a few feet."}

{"id":"Butterfly_9_2","contents":"Jeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\n  \n \n  The fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy.

The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n  \n \n  \"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\n  \n \n  The man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\n  \n \n  He spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow.

You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain.

Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear.

{"id":"Butterfly_9_4","contents":"Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking.

He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black.

On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland.

{"id":"Butterfly_9_5","contents":"Instead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed\na group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor.

He asked Snader, \"Where do you propose to go? And how?\"\n  \n \n  Snader said, \"Watch me. Then look at other wall.\"\n  \n \n  He moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and\ndisappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.\n  \n \n  Jeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his\ninstruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in\nthe far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky\nfigure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds,\nhe was recognizable as Snader\u2014and as the picture brought him forward,\nhe stepped down out of it and was with them again.\n  \n \n  \"Simple,\" Snader said. \"I rode to next station.

It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\n  \n \n  In fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\n  \n \n  The square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\n  \n \n  Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n  \n \n  \"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\n  \n \n  Another lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\n  \n \n  Snader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\n  \n \n  For a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n  \n \n  \"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\n  \n \n  He took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\n  \n \n \n \n  Again there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n  \n \n  \"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\""}
{"id":"Butterfly_9_7","contents":"Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n  \n \n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n  \n \n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n  \n \n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n  \n \n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n  \n \n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n  \n \n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door."}
{"id":"Butterfly_9_8","contents":"A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n  \n \n  \"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n  \n \n  \"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\n  \n \n  The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\n  \n \n  He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n  \n \n  Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n  \n \n  Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\n  \n \n  The blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\n  \n \n  Kersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n  \n \n  \"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff nodded. \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  The old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\""}
{"id":"Butterfly_9_9","contents":"Bullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. \"No fog about this!\nYou're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,\nbut you do what I say!\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the man thinks he owns you.\" Ann laughed shakily.\n  \n \n  \"You'll find my barmen know their law,\" Bullen said. \"This isn't the\nway I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your\nknowledge.\"\n  \n \n  Kersey said politely, \"You are here illegally, with no immigrate\npermit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen\nhas taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can\nmake a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you\nto live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He\nwondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange\nstreets. But he put on a bold front.\n  \n \n  \"I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work\nfor you,\" he said. \"My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and\nstop us, legally or any other way.\"\n  \n \n  Kersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen\nchuckled deep in his throat. \"Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go\non, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here\u2014Butterfly 9, ask for\nBullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow\npre-noon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann.\"\n  \n \n  When they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. \"We made it.\nFor a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics\u2014or practical jokers.\" He\nlooked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was\nno sign of pursuit. \"It's a long time since supper.\""}
{"id":"Butterfly_9_10","contents":"Her hand was cold in his and her face was white. To take her mind off\ntheir problem, he ambled toward the lighted shop windows.\n  \n \n  \"Look at that sign,\" he said, pointing to a poster over a display of\nneckties. \"'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!' How do they\nexpect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.\" Ann\nglanced nervously at the strolling people around them. \"Jeff, where\nare we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't\neven look much like America.\" Her voice rose. \"The way the women are\ndressed\u2014it's not old-fashioned, just different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.\" He\npressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.\n  \n \n  If the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same\njargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff\npondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit\nchills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what\nclearly were hamburgers\u2014though the \"buns\" looked more like tortillas.\n  \n \n  Jeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, \"Two, please.\"\n  \n \n  When the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate\nin silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.\n  \n \n  When they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1\/20. Jeff looked\nat it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two\ndollar bills.\n  \n \n  The man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. \"Stage money, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, that's good money,\" Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.\n\"They're just new bills, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  The cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. \"I'm afraid it's\nno good here,\" he said, and pushed it back.\n  \n \n  The bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. \"What kind of money do you\nwant? This is all I have.\"\n  \n \n  The cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one\nof the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a\npoliceman. He loomed up beside Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"What's the rasper?\" he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their\nchecks, eyed Jeff curiously.\n  \n \n  \"I guess I'm in trouble,\" Jeff told him. \"I'm a stranger here and I got\nsomething to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender.\nDo you know where I can exchange it?\""}
{"id":"Butterfly_9_11","contents":"The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place?

One of\nthe others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and\nsaid to him in a low voice, \"Think about retirement, my friend.\" The\nthird one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked\nquickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with\nmoney.\n  \n \n  It was just like the movies.\n  \n \n  The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and\nthe customers all over against the back wall, while the second man\nstayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door.

He followed the patrolman down the hall to the\nfront desk.\n  \n \n  The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall\nand paunchy. \"John Hastings,\" he said. \"They say you have my car here.\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe so, yes,\" said Stevenson. \"I'm afraid it's in pretty bad\nshape.\"\n  \n \n  \"So I was told over the phone,\" said Hastings grimly. \"I've contacted\nmy insurance company.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come\nwith me?\""}
{"id":"CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_4","contents":"On the way around, Stevenson said, \"I believe you reported the car\nstolen almost immediately after it happened.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" said Hastings. \"I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm\na wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car\nwas gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"You left the keys in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, why not?\" demanded Hastings belligerently. \"If I'm making just\na quick stop\u2014I never spend more than five minutes with any one\ncustomer\u2014I always leave the keys in the car.

It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,\nthe address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a\nnewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.\n  \n \n  The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor:\n  \n \n  The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion\nfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging\nScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It\ndidn't rate a line in the paper.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man\nwent berserk.\n  \n \n  It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica\nBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,\ncomposed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a\nMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.\n  \n \n  Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the\nthird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,\nbrooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.\n  \n \n  As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to\nawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he\nreally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then\nallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma\nStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the\nhouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked\nbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and\n\"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they\nheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a\nman sleep?\"\n  \n \n  At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,\na two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of\nsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted\nfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being\nannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells\nat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the\nhand and shoulder.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming\nout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,\n\"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One\nneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television\nstations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards."}
{"id":"CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_5","contents":"By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt\nParkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild\nAirport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a\nposition across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work\nwith a Zoomar lens.\n  \n \n  In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house,\nfiring at anything that moved.\n  \n \n  The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One\nconcentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors\nand ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to\nsearch for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home\naudience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and\nundershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the\nhouse.\n  \n \n  The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere,\nand firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the\ncorner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr.\nHiggins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The\npolice used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they\nhad the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway.\nHiggins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge\nanyone present to hand-to-hand combat.\n  \n \n  The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day\nand all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken.\nHiggins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.\n  \n \n  The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and\ndramatically.\n  \n \n  Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of\nshooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and\nthrew the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered\ndown to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell\nbarrel first onto the lawn.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a\nwounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall\ninto the arms of the waiting police.\n  \n \n  They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually\ntrying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was\nshouting: \"My hands! My hands!\"\n  \n \n  They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers\nwere red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was\nanother burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.\n  \n \n  Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn\nointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The\nneighbors went home and telephoned their friends.\n  \n \n  On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the\nprecincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William\nStevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy\nindividual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle.\nHe touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.\n  \n \n  He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the\nstock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, \"The\nScorpion.\""}

WARN YOUR READERS.\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had\nseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the\nsame place, and forgotten.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around\nfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up\ncarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on\nyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a\nJD.\n  \n \n  The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances\non two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and\nthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides\nclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys\nfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that\nhad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and\ndetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n  \n \n  The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.\nThe weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no\npistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner\nwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both\nentrances.\n  \n \n  The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate\nclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play\nchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of\nthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might\ncome wandering through.\n  \n \n  Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen\nyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,\ngum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the\nScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to\nher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n  \n \n  Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were\ndark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,\nparticularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone\npole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet\nRaider jacket and waited.\n  \n \n  At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The\nrumble had started.\n  \n \n  At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the\nstreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them\ncarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks\non.\n  \n \n  They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey,\nyou kids. Take off.\"\n  \n \n  One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n  \n \n  \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n  \n \n  \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\""}
{"id":"CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_7","contents":"\"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long\nway to go to get home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down\nthat street.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete\nand elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt\nand a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a\nblack knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down\nthere?\" this apparition demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here.\nTake off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're\nfighting down there!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be\ninvolved.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went\nrunning around Judy and dashing off down the street.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\"\n  \n \n  Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase\nthe one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would\ncome running along after her. She didn't know what to do.\n  \n \n  A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.\n\"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\"\n  \n \n  \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the\nschoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\"\n  \n \n  But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the\nschoolyard.\n  \n \n  The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving\ntheir arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling\noff their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering.\nThey were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's\nwarning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both\nschoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy\nand the rumble was over.\n  \n \n \n \n  Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great\nbig blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in\nthe yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.\n  \n \n  And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault."}

The sort of night\nthat makes a spaceman wonder why in hell he wants to leave the relative\nsecurity of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle to go jetting across the belt\ninto deep space and the drab desolation of the outer System.\n  \n \n  I stood there, watching the lights of Canalopolis in the distance. For\njust a moment I was ... well, touched. It looked beautiful and unreal\nunder the racing moons. The lights of the gin mills and houses made a\nsparkling filigree pattern on the dark waters of the ancient canal, and\nthe moons cast their shifting shadows across the silted banks. I was\ntoo far away to see the space-fevered bums and smell the shanties, and\nfor a little while I felt the wonder of standing on the soil of a world\nthat man had made his own with his rapacity and his sheer guts and\ngimme.\n  \n \n  I thought of our half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload we would\npick up on Callisto. And I counted the extra cash my packets of snow\nwould bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of\nthe outer Systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid\nthat the Holcomb Foundation snoopers never heard about, you can be sure\nof that.\n  \n \n  In those days the asteroid belt was\n   \n   the\n   \n  primary danger and menace to\nastrogation. For a long while it held men back from deep space, but as\nfuels improved a few ships were sent out over the top. A few million\nmiles up out of the ecliptic plane brings you to a region of space\nthat's pretty thinly strewn with asteroids, and that's the way we used\nto make the flight between the outer systems and the EMV Triangle. It\ntook a long while for hyperdrives to be developed and of course atomics\nnever panned out because of the weight problem.\n  \n \n  So that's the orbit the Maid took on that last trip of mine. High\nand clear into the supra-solar void. And out there in that primeval\nblackness is where we found the derelict."}
{"id":"CAPTAIN_MIDAS_3","contents":"I didn't realize it was a derelict when Spinelli first reported\nit from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation\nship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\""}
{"id":"CAPTAIN_MIDAS_4","contents":"The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was\nher size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n  \n \n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n  \n \n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n  \n \n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n  \n \n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n  \n \n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n  \n \n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n  \n \n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n  \n \n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n  \n \n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n   \n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n   \n  ....\n  \n \n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n  \n \n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n  \n \n \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n   \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n  \n \n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery...."}
{"id":"CAPTAIN_MIDAS_5","contents":"A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the\ndoorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black\neyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.\nHe needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me\nthat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was\nthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my\nquarters!\"\n  \n \n  Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the\nderelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last\ntwo words.\n  \n \n  I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on\nthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize\ncrew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\"\n  \n \n  I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a\nfirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would\nneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me\nto beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me,\nSpinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\"\n  \n \n  Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning\nslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat\nhim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.\n  \n \n  \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister\nSpinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is\nthat clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face\nand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he\nturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like\nhim to let it go at that.\n  \n \n  Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't\nfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I\nrubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering\nabout Spinelli.\n  \n \n  Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and\nafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.\n  \n \n  For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat\nto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first\nplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the\nsecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.\n  \n \n  I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and\nI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that\nthere was no double-cross.\n  \n \n  I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the\nrest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.\nThat way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the\ntreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they\nwere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.\n  \n \n  I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with\nthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally\nI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had\nset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict."}
{"id":"CAPTAIN_MIDAS_6","contents":"Together, Spinelli and I watched the Maid's crew vanish into the maw\nof the alien ship and get her under way. There was a flicker of bluish\nfire from her jury-rigged tubes astern, and then she was vanishing in a\ngreat arc toward the bright gleam of Jupiter, far below us. The Maid\nfollowed under a steady one G of acceleration with most of her controls\non automatic.\n  \n \n  Boats of the Martian Maid's class, you may remember, carried a six\ninch supersonic projector abaft the astrogation turret. These were\nnasty weapons for use against organic life only. They would reduce a\nman to jelly at fifty thousand yards. Let it be said to my credit that\nit wasn't I who thought of hooking the gun into the radar finder and\nkeeping it aimed dead at the derelict. That was Spinelli's insurance\nagainst Zaleski.\n  \n \n  When I discovered it I felt the rage mount in me. He was willing to\nblast every one of his shipmates into pulp should the hulk vary from\nthe orbit we'd laid out for her. He wasn't letting anything come\nbetween him and that mountain of gold.\n  \n \n  Then I began thinking about it. Suppose now, just suppose, that Zaleski\ntold the rest of the crew about the gold. It wouldn't be too hard\nfor the derelict to break away from the Maid, and there were plenty\nof places in the EMV Triangle where a renegade crew with a thousand\ntons of gold would be welcomed with open arms and no questions asked.\nSuspicion began to eat at me. Could Zaleski and Cohn have dreamed up\na little switch to keep the treasure ship for themselves? It hadn't\nseemed likely before, but now\u2014\n  \n \n  The gun-pointer remained as it was.\n  \n \n  As the days passed and we reached turn-over with the hulk still well\nwithin visual range, I noticed a definite decrease in the number of\nmessages from Cohn. The Aldis Lamps no longer blinked back at the Maid\neight or ten times a day, and I began to really regret not having taken\nthe time to equip the starship with UHF radio communicators.\n  \n \n  Each night I slept with a hunk of yellow gold under my bunk, and\nridiculously I fondled the stuff and dreamed of all the things I would\nhave when the starship was cut up and sold.\n  \n \n  My weariness grew. It became almost chronic, and I soon wondered if\nI hadn't picked up a touch of space-radiation fever. The flesh of my\nhands seemed paler than it had been. My arms felt heavy. I determined\nto report myself to the Foundation medics on Callisto. There's no\ntelling what can happen to a man in space....\n  \n \n  Two days past turn-over the messages from the derelict came through\ngarbled. Spinelli cursed and said that he couldn't read their signal.\nTaking the Aldis from him I tried to raise them and failed. Two hours\nlater I was still failing and Spinelli's black eyes glittered with an\nanimal suspicion.\n  \n \n  \"They're faking!\"\n  \n \n  \"Like hell they are!\" I snapped irritably, \"Something's gone wrong....\"\n  \n \n  \"Zaleski's gone wrong, that's what!\"\n  \n \n  I turned to face him, fury snapping inside of me. \"Then you did disobey\nmy orders. You told him about the gold!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure I did,\" he sneered. \"Did you expect me to shut up and let you\nland the ship yourself and claim Captain's share?\n   \n   I\n   \n  found her, and\nshe's mine!\"\n  \n \n  I fought to control my temper and said: \"Let's see what's going on in\nher before deciding who gets what, Mister Spinelli.\"\n  \n \n  Spinelli bit his thick lips and did not reply. His eyes were fixed on\nthe image of the starship on the viewplate.\n  \n \n  A light blinked erratically within the dark cut of its wounded side.\n  \n \n  \"Get this down, Spinelli!\"\n  \n \n  The habit of taking orders was still in him, and he muttered: \"Aye ...\nsir.\"\n  \n \n  The light was winking out a message, but feebly, as though the hand\nthat held the lamp were shaking and the mind conceiving the words were\nfailing.\n  \n \n  \"CONTROL ... LOST ... CAN'T ... NO ... STRENGTH ... LEFT ... SHIP ...\nWALLS ... ALL ... ALL GOLD ... GOLD ... SOMETHING ... HAPPENING ...\nCAN'T ... UNDERSTAND ... WHA....\" The light stopped flashing, abruptly,\nin mid-word.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell?\" demanded Spinelli thickly.\n  \n \n  \"Order them to heave to, Mister,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  He clicked the Aldis at them. The only response was a wild swerve in\nthe star-ship's course. She left the orbit we had set for her as though\nthe hands that guided her had fallen away from the control.\n  \n \n  Spinelli dropped the Aldis and rushed to the control panel to make the\ncorrections in the Maid's course that were needed to keep the hulk in\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Those skunks! Double crossing rats!\" he breathed furiously. \"They\nwon't shake loose that easy!\" His hands started down for the firing\nconsole of the supersonic rifle.\n  \n \n  I caught the movement from the corner of my eye.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Spinelli!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  My shout hung in the still air of the control room as I knocked him\naway from the panel.\n  \n \n  \"Get to your quarters!\" I cracked.\n  \n \n  He didn't say a thing, but his big shoulders hunched angrily and\nhe moved across the deck toward me, his hands opening and closing\nspasmodically. His eyes were wild with rage and avarice.\n  \n \n  \"You'll hang for mutiny, Spinelli!\" I said."}
{"id":"CAPTAIN_MIDAS_7","contents":"He spat out a foul name and leaped for me. I side-stepped his charge\nand brought my joined fists down hard on the back of his neck. He\nstumbled against the bulkhead and his eyes were glazed. He charged\nagain, roaring. I stepped aside and smashed him in the mouth with my\nright fist, then crossing with an open-handed left to the throat. He\nstaggered, spun and came for me again. I sank a hard left into his\nstomach and nailed him on the point of the jaw with a right from my\nshoe-tops. He straightened up and sprawled heavily to the deck, still\ntrying to get at me.

Some of the greed died out of me, and my exertions had\nincreased my sense of fatigue to an almost numbing weariness. My arms\nached terribly and my hands felt as though they had been sucked dry of\ntheir substance. Like a man in a nightmare, I held them up before my\nface and looked at them.

Nothing fought against the\nflood of terror that welled through me. I was terrified of that yellow\ngold in my cabin, and of that ship of devil's metal out there in space\nthat held my shipmates. There was something unnatural about that\ncontra-terrene thing ... something obscene.\n  \n \n  I located the hulk in the radar finder and swung the Maid after it,\npiling on acceleration until my vision flickered.

Then I was struggling to get myself into a pressure suit with\nmy wrinkled, failing hands.... Then I was outside, headed for that dark\nhole.\n  \n \n  I sank down into the stillness of her interior, my helmet light casting\nlong, fey shadows across the littered decks. Decks that had a yellowish\ncast ... decks that no longer danced with tiny questing force-whorls....\n  \n \n  As I approached the airlock of the compartment set aside as living\nquarters for the prize crew, the saffron of the walls deepened. Crazy\nlittle thoughts began spinning around in my brain. Words out of the\ndistant past loomed up with a new and suddenly terrifying\nperspective ... alchemy ... transmutation ... energy. I'm a spaceman,\nnot a scientist. But in those moments I think I was discovering what\nhad happened to my crew and why the walls were turning into yellow\nmetal.\n  \n \n  The lock was closed, but I swung it open and let the pressure in the\nchamber rise. I couldn't wait for it to reach fourteen pounds ...\nat eleven, I swung the inner door and stumbled eagerly through.

The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\nto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\nthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\nMr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\nand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\nCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\nnow that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n  \n \n  The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\nhold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\na microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n\"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n  \n \n  \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n\"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\nget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\nread. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a\nsecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\nwith the Bank's operation?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\nthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to\nask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\ncoffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take\ncare of these details now? Or would you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems\nbest to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's\nmight explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's\nsecretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,\ngirl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket,\nunfolded it to discover the day's\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , and began at\nthe top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,\nnodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\n\"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\n  \n \n  Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the\none into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then\ntook off upstairs in the elevator."}
{"id":"CINDERELLA_STORY_2","contents":"By lunchtime Orison had finished the\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  and had\nbegun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a\nfantastic novel of some sort, named\n   \n   The Hobbit\n   \n  . Reading this peculiar\nfare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than\never that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her,\nthe front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a\nFederal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a\nmicrophone for an invisible audience.\n  \n \n  Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the\nbook and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was\na new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming\ndown from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with\nbriefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these\ngentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped\naboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his\nheart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment\nof their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny\ninto this curiousest of banks.\n  \n \n  Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude.\nGirls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together,\neyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and\nfavored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed,\nfinished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her\nlonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book,\nreading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of\nBilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her\nlight coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed,\nsilent, hat-clasping gentlemen.\n  \n \n  What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a\ndouble Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard\nTaft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of\nthe U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association.\nEarmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President\nwith the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those\nupper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment\nhouse\u2014the Windsor Arms\u2014and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her\nboss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft\nBank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought.\nShe was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker.\n  \n \n  Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day's\nobservations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for\nher initial report. Item: some of the men at the Bank wore earmuffs,\nseveral didn't. Item: the Vice-President's name was Mr. Wanji:\nOriental? Item: the top eight floors of the Taft Bank Building seemed\nto be off-limits to all personnel not wearing earmuffs. Item: she was\nbeing employed at a very respectable salary to read newsprint and\nnonsense into a microphone. Let Washington make sense of that, she\nthought."}
{"id":"CINDERELLA_STORY_3","contents":"In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\no'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n  \n \n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n  \n \n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n  \n \n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding."}
{"id":"CINDERELLA_STORY_4","contents":"Orison finished the\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  by early afternoon. A\npage came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of\nyesterday's\n   \n   Congressional Record\n   \n  . She launched into the\n   \n   Record\n   \n  ,\nthinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome\nmadman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read\nso\n   \n   well\n   \n  , darling,\" someone said across the desk.\n  \n \n  Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn't hear you come up.\"\n  \n \n  \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front\nof the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison\nthought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't like\nher. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing\nteeth.\n  \n \n  \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm\nAuga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\n  \n \n  \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to\nvisit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.\nOne for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to\ndraw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding\u2014you know, the\nshoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should\nyou throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little\neyes scratched out. Word to the wise,\n   \n   n'est-ce pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her\n   \n   Wall\nStreet Journal\n   \n  into a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\n  \n \n  \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here.\nYou could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of\nannoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to\nyour stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right\noff?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator,\ndisplaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba\nmotion.\n  \n \n  The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,\nstepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\n  \n \n  \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,\nhe stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused\nand shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ...\nVingt thing....\"\n  \n \n  \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\n  \n \n  \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank\nand Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding,\nDink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped\neven closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch\nof frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The\nhead, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's\nspike-topped\n   \n   Pickelhauben\n   \n  ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed\nnormal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed\u2014what continental manners these bankers\nhad!\u2014and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up\npaper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it."}
{"id":"CINDERELLA_STORY_5","contents":"Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and\nsaid, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,\nMiss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing\nbusiness with pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she\nshouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I\ncare. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in\nfinance, and listen to another word.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,\na bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most\ncharming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,\ndear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to\nthe wise....\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   N'est-ce pas?\n   \n  \" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the\nfoolish. Get lost.\"\n  \n \n  Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind\nyou. Push a button, will you? And\n   \n   bon voyage\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with\na cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above\nfifth floor.\n  \n \n  First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.\nSurely, Orison thought, recovering the\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  from her\nwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern\nbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior\nof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\nthought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\nand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\nfinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\nupper floors.\n  \n \n  Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\nsudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \"\n   \n   Wanji e-Kal, Datto.\nDink ger-Dink d'summa.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before\nreplying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda\nclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see\nhim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down.\nWhat now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language\nMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by\ntonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\nit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\nshe had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\nonly fire her.\n  \n \n  Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\nbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.\nThe elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\noff the upstairs floors.\n  \n \n  But the building had a stairway.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\nseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\nthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\nwas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\nfringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n  \n \n  She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n  \n \n  Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\nextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\nits ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\ngalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\nOrison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\nand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\nstrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\npink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\nfull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\nOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\nliquid. Then she screamed.\n  \n \n \n \n  The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\nthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\nupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\nleaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\nput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\nstairway door.\n  \n \n  Into a pair of arms.\n  \n \n  \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\nOrison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\nher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\nGerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he\nsaid. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were\nwe to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against\nher two\n   \n   sumo\n   \n  -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by\nsome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the\nfloor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted\nall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of\ncourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of\ncalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within\nminutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of\nthe earmuffed\n   \n   sumo\n   \n  -wrestlers protested.\n  \n \n  \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you\nmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\n  \n \n  \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of\ndamsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the\nbank.\"\n  \n \n  \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you\nacromegalic apes!\"\n  \n \n  \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\""}
{"id":"CINDERELLA_STORY_6","contents":"Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as\nthough struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their\nfaces abject against the floor.

Without\nquestions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms\naround Orison.\n  \n \n  \"They can't harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against\nhis chest. \"You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn\nyour brain back on.

She stood close\nto Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see\nwhat it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was\nforbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for\nyou, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you\nthat the escudo green is pale.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what\nis this thing you have about spiders?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little\ngirl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a\nspider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came\nhome and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite\nfor supper.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked\none of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider,\nOrison,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped\nin the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related\nto shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They're stone-and-metal\neaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He\nextended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,\nflesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around\nthe bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn't he?\" Dink asked.\n\"Here.

Something\nlike the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing\ntogether while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He\ntook her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these\nlittle workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\n  \n \n  Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to\nthe music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,\nstorm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace\nand harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash\nof breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the\nquiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\n\"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been\nsinging it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a\nwood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\n\"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\n\"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the\nmineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the\nliquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\n\"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she\nthought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling\nlife. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands."}

Not a\n   \n  thing seemed wrong with it. Excepting the food,\n   \n  perhaps. And a disease that wasn't really.\n  \n \n \n  It was like an Earth forest in the fall, but it was not fall. The\nforest leaves were green and copper and purple and fiery red, and a\nwind sent patches of bright greenish sunlight dancing among the leaf\nshadows.\n  \n \n  The hunt party of the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  filed along the narrow trail, guns\nready, walking carefully, listening to the distant, half familiar cries\nof strange birds.\n  \n \n  A faint crackle of static in their earphones indicated that a gun had\nbeen fired.\n  \n \n  \"Got anything?\" asked June Walton. The helmet intercom carried her\nvoice to the ears of the others without breaking the stillness of the\nforest.\n  \n \n  \"Took a shot at something,\" explained George Barton's cheerful voice\nin her earphones. She rounded a bend of the trail and came upon Barton\nstanding peering up into the trees, his gun still raised. \"It looked\nlike a duck.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't Central Park,\" said Hal Barton, his brother, coming into\nsight. His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the\nbronze and red forest. \"They won't all look like ducks,\" he said\nsoberly.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe some will look like dragons. Don't get eaten by a dragon,\nJune,\" came Max's voice quietly into her earphones. \"Not while I still\nlove you.\" He came out of the trees carrying the blood sample kit, and\ntouched her glove with his, the grin on his ugly beloved face barely\nvisible in the mingled light and shade. A patch of sunlight struck a\ngreenish glint from his fishbowl helmet."}

A quarter of a mile back, the space ship\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  towered over the forest like a tapering skyscraper, and the people of\nthe ship looked out of the viewplates at fresh winds and sunlight and\nclouds, and they longed to be outside.\n  \n \n  But the likeness to Earth was danger, and the cool wind might be death,\nfor if the animals were like Earth animals, their diseases might be\nlike Earth diseases, alike enough to be contagious, different enough to\nbe impossible to treat. There was warning enough in the past. Colonies\nhad vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships\nwhich had touched on some plague planet.\n  \n \n  The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight\nspacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.\n  \n \n  The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the\nalien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the\ncopper and purple shadows.\n  \n \n  They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker\nbrowns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her\nsomeone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole\nin the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved.\n  \n \n  This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful,\nhumanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller\nthan any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood\nbreathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung\na sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder.\n  \n \n  They lowered their guns.\n  \n \n  \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he\nreached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be\nheard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\"\n  \n \n  The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest\nsounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of\nevolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be\nwearing a three day growth of red stubble.\n  \n \n  Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to\nMinos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\"\n  \n \n  \"English?\" gasped June.\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to\nyou.... It's three hundred miles....

She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles,\nlike him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly\nhumorous blue eyes.\n  \n \n  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and\nme?\"\n  \n \n  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.\n\"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think\nthat people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit\nso many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I\nsuppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside\ndown!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air\nis breathable.\"\n  \n \n  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"\n  \n \n  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the\nwind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take\noff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins.\nMinos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.\n  \n \n  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two\nyears after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead\nfamilies. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all\nrelated, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way\npeople can look.\"\n  \n \n \n   Plague.\n   \n  \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting\nsickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to\ndo about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for\nsome.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.\n  \n \n  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all\nthe books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion,\nand never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship\nwere indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone\nand machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace\nthem. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife\nand bow.\n  \n \n  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other diseases?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a one.\"\n  \n \n  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching\nawe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on\nthe intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\""}

June saw that they were friends already, the\ntall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a\nstab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being\nsmaller and frailer than Pat Mead.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid\nsamples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the\narm.\"\n  \n \n  Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed\nand inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine\nnerve surgeon on Earth.\n  \n \n  High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship\nand angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly,\nit veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from\ntheir earphones:\n  \n \n  \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He\nbanked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could\nsee his startled face looking through the glass at Pat.\n  \n \n  Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and\npointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew\naway over the odd-colored forest.\n  \n \n  \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got\nthrough to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max\ndexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles\nwithout exposing them to air.\n  \n \n  \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still\ncarry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't\nshow on you, but still carry enough germs\u2014if that's what caused it\u2014to\nwipe out a planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able\nto mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\"\n  \n \n  \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked.\n  \n \n  \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on\nboard.\"\n  \n \n  \"More needles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rough?\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't easy.\"\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit\ndecontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in\nglares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and\ncompared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.\n  \n \n  In the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers,\nwas the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes\nso like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused\nchemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing\ncould live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to\nthe body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name.\n  \n \n  But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had\nbeen known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human\ntreatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and\ninterplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding\nagainst disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient.\n  \n \n  Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and\naround like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall\nby peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered\nto insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given\nsolutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic\nblasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being\ndirected to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized\nand injected with various immunizing solutions.\n  \n \n  Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme\ndryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were\ndripped into his veins through long thin tubes.\n  \n \n  All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of\nallowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him."}

In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n  \n \n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n  \n \n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n  \n \n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate.

After a year and a half\nof isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces,\nthe sound of unfamiliar voices."}
{"id":"CONTAGION_8","contents":"They climbed the last two turns to the cafeteria, and entered to a rich\nsubdued blend of soft music and quiet conversations. The cafeteria\nwas a section of the old dining room, left when the rest of the ship\nhad been converted to living and working quarters, and it still had\nthe original finely grained wood of the ceiling and walls, the sound\nabsorbency, the soft music spools and the intimate small light at each\ntable where people leisurely ate and talked.\n  \n \n  They stood in line at the hot foods counter, and behind her June\ncould hear a girl's voice talking excitedly through the murmur of\nconversation.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014new man, honest! I saw him through the viewplate when they came in.\nHe's down in the medical department. A real frontiersman.\"\n  \n \n  The line drew abreast of the counters, and she and Max chose three\nheaping trays, starting with hydroponic mushroom steak, raised in\nthe growing trays of water and chemicals; sharp salad bowl with rose\ntomatoes and aromatic peppers; tank-grown fish with special sauce; four\ndifferent desserts, and assorted beverages.\n  \n \n  Presently they had three tottering trays successfully maneuvered to a\ntable. Brant St. Clair came over. \"I beg your pardon, Max, but they are\nsaying something about Reno carrying messages to a colony of savages,\nfor the medical department. Will he be back soon, do you know?\"\n  \n \n  Max smiled up at him, his square face affectionate. Everyone liked the\nshy Canadian. \"He's back already. We just saw him come in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, fine.\" St. Clair beamed. \"I had an appointment with him to go out\nand confirm what looks like a nice vein of iron to the northeast. Have\nyou seen Bess? Oh\u2014there she is.\" He turned swiftly and hurried away.\n  \n \n  A very tall man with fiery red hair came in surrounded by an eagerly\ntalking crowd of ship people. It was Pat Mead. He stood in the doorway,\nalertly scanning the dining room. Sheer vitality made him seem even\nlarger than he was. Sighting June, he smiled and began to thread toward\ntheir table.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" said someone. \"There's the colonist!\" Shelia, a pretty, jeweled\nwoman, followed and caught his arm. \"Did you\n   \n   really\n   \n  swim across a\nriver to come here?\"\n  \n \n  Overflowing with good-will and curiosity, people approached from all\ndirections. \"Did you actually walk three hundred miles? Come, eat with\nus. Let me help choose your tray.\"\n  \n \n  Everyone wanted him to eat at their table, everyone was a specialist\nand wanted data about Minos. They all wanted anecdotes about hunting\nwild animals with a bow and arrow.\n  \n \n  \"He needs to be rescued,\" Max said. \"He won't have a chance to eat.\"\n  \n \n  June and Max got up firmly, edged through the crowd, captured Pat and\nescorted him back to their table. June found herself pleased to be\nclaiming the hero of the hour."}
{"id":"CONTAGION_9","contents":"Pat sat in the simple, subtly designed chair and leaned back almost\nvoluptuously, testing the way it gave and fitted itself to him. He\nran his eyes over the bright tableware and heaped plates. He looked\naround at the rich grained walls and soft lights at each table. He said\nnothing, just looking and feeling and experiencing.\n  \n \n  \"When we build our town and leave the ship,\" June explained, \"we\nwill turn all the staterooms back into the lounges and ballrooms and\ncocktail bars that used to be inside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" Pat said negligently. He cocked his head to\nthe music, and tried to locate its source.\n  \n \n  \"That's big of you,\" said Max with gentle irony.\n  \n \n  They fell to, Pat beginning the first meal he had had in more than a\nday.\n  \n \n  Most of the other diners finished when they were halfway through,\nand began walking over, diffidently at first, then in another wave\nof smiling faces, handshakes, and introductions. Pat was asked about\ncrops, about farming methods, about rainfall and floods, about farm\nanimals and plant breeding, about the compatibility of imported Earth\nseeds with local ground, about mines and strata.\n  \n \n  There was no need to protect him. He leaned back in his chair and\ndrawled answers with the lazy ease of a panther; where he could think\nof no statistic, he would fill the gap with an anecdote. It developed\nthat he enjoyed spinning campfire yarns and especially being the center\nof interest.\n  \n \n  Between bouts of questions, he ate with undiminished and glowing relish.\n  \n \n  June noticed that the female specialists were prolonging the questions\nmore than they needed, clustering around the table laughing at his\njokes, until presently Pat was almost surrounded by pretty faces,\neager questions, and chiming laughs. Shelia the beautiful laughed most\nchimingly of all.\n  \n \n  June nudged Max, and Max shrugged indifferently. It wasn't anything a\nman would pay attention to, perhaps. But June watched Pat for a moment\nmore, then glanced uneasily back to Max. He was eating and listening\nto Pat's answers and did not feel her gaze. For some reason Max looked\nalmost shrunken to her. He was shorter than she had realized; she had\nforgotten that he was only the same height as herself. She was dimly\naware of the clear lilting chatter of female voices increasing at Pat's\nend of the table.\n  \n \n  \"That guy's a menace,\" Max said, and laughed to himself, cutting\nanother slice of hydroponic mushroom steak. \"What's eating you?\" he\nadded, glancing aside at her when he noticed her sudden stillness.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" she said hastily, but she did not turn back to watching Pat\nMead. She felt disloyal. Pat was only a superb animal. Max was the man\nshe loved. Or\u2014was he? Of course he was, she told herself angrily.\nThey had gone colonizing together because they wanted to spend their\nlives together; she had never thought of marrying any other man. Yet\nthe sense of dissatisfaction persisted, and along with it a feeling of\nguilt.\n  \n \n  Len Marlow, the protein tank-culture technician responsible for the\nmushroom steaks, had wormed his way into the group and asked Pat a\nquestion. Now he was saying, \"I don't dig you, Pat. It sounds like\nyou're putting the people into the tanks instead of the vegetables!\" He\nglanced at them, looking puzzled. \"See if you two can make anything of\nthis. It sounds medical to me.\"\n  \n \n  Pat leaned back and smiled, sipping a glass of hydroponic burgundy.\n\"Wonderful stuff. You'll have to show us how to make it.\"\n  \n \n  Len turned back to him. \"You people live off the country, right? You\nhunt and bring in steaks and eat them, right? Well, say I have one of\nthose steaks right here and I want to eat it, what happens?\""}
{"id":"CONTAGION_10","contents":"\"Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest. You'd stay hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\" Len was aggrieved.\n  \n \n  \"Chemical differences in the basic protoplasm of Minos.

Nothing will be digestible here until\nyou are adapted chemically by a little test-tube evolution. Till then\nyou'd starve to death on a full stomach.\"\n  \n \n  Pat's side of the table had been loaded with the dishes from two trays,\nbut it was almost clear now and the dishes were stacked neatly to one\nside. He started on three desserts, thoughtfully tasting each in turn.\n  \n \n  \"Test-tube evolution?\" Max repeated. \"What's that? I thought you people\nhad no doctors.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a story.\" Pat leaned back again. \"Alexander P. Mead, the head of\nthe Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality\nand no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle\nof killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the\nface of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided\nthat he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying. He did\nit all right.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Did which?\" asked June, suddenly feeling a sourceless prickle of fear.\n  \n \n  \"Adapted us to Minos. He took human cells\u2014\""}
{"id":"CONTAGION_11","contents":"She listened intently, trying to find a reason for fear in the\nexplanation. It would have taken many human generations to adapt to\nMinos by ordinary evolution, and that only at a heavy toll of death and\nhunger which evolution exacts. There was a shorter way: Human cells\nhave the ability to return to their primeval condition of independence,\nhunting, eating and reproducing alone.\n  \n \n  Alexander P. Mead took human cells and made them into phagocytes.\nHe put them through the hard savage school of evolution\u2014a thousand\ngenerations of multiplication, hardship and hunger, with the alien\nindigestible food always present, offering its reward of plenty to the\ncell that reluctantly learned to absorb it.\n  \n \n  \"Leucocytes can run through several thousand generations of evolution\nin six months,\" Pat Mead finished. \"When they reached to a point where\nthey would absorb Minos food, he planted them back in the people he\nhad taken them from.\"\n  \n \n  \"What was supposed to happen then?\" Max asked, leaning forward.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know exactly how it worked.

He tried it on all the Meads the first year. The other settlers\ndidn't want to be experimented on until they saw how it worked out. It\nworked. The Meads could hunt, and plant while the other settlers were\nstill eating out of hydroponics tanks.\"\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" said Max to Len. \"You're a plant geneticist and a tank\nculture expert. There's a job for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-\n   \n   uh\n   \n  !\" Len backed away. \"It sounds like a medical problem to me.\nHuman cell control\u2014right up your alley.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a one-way street,\" Pat warned. \"Once it is done, you won't be\nable to digest ship food. I'll get no good from this protein. I ate it\njust for the taste.\"\n  \n \n  Hal Barton appeared quietly beside the table. \"Three of the twelve test\nhamsters have died,\" he reported, and turned to Pat. \"Your people carry\nthe germs of melting sickness, as you call it. The dead hamsters were\ninjected with blood taken from you before you were de-infected. We\ncan't settle here unless we de-infect everybody on Minos. Would they\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  \"We wouldn't want to give you folks germs,\" Pat smiled. \"Anything for\nsafety. But there'll have to be a vote on it first.\"\n  \n \n  The doctors went to Reno Ulrich's table and walked with him to the\nhangar, explaining. He was to carry the proposal to Alexandria, mingle\nwith the people, be persuasive and wait for them to vote before\nreturning. He was to give himself shots of cureall every two hours on\nthe hour or run the risk of disease."}

One was the control;\nthe other two had been given shots of Pat's blood from before he\nentered the ship, but with no additional treatment. Apparently a\nhamster could fight off melting sickness easily if left alone. Three\nwere still feverish and ruffled, with a low red blood count, but\nrecovering. The three dead ones had been given strong shots of adaptive\nand counter histamine, so their bodies had not fought back against the\nattack.\n  \n \n  June glanced at the dead animals hastily and looked away again.\nThey lay twisted with a strange semi-fluid limpness, as if ready to\ndissolve. The last hamster, which had been given the heaviest dose\nof adaptive, had apparently lost all its hair before death. It was\nhairless and pink, like a still-born baby.\n  \n \n  \"We can find no micro-organisms,\" George Barton said. \"None at all.\nNothing in the body that should not be there.

Pediatrics and obstetrics were her\nfield; she left the cellular research to Max, and just helped him with\nlaboratory routine. The strange mood followed her out into the hall,\nthen abruptly lightened.\n  \n \n  Coming toward her, busily telling a tale of adventure to the gorgeous\nShelia Davenport, was a tall, red-headed, magnificently handsome man.\nIt was his handsomeness which made Pat such a pleasure to look upon\nand talk with, she guiltily told herself, and it was his tremendous\nvitality....

Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

He threw the ethergram\nto the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy\u2014so\ncalled because his full name was Quentin Zuyler\u2014dropped the ship\nstraight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it\ntight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought\nout two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with\nstar-powdered infinity spread to all sides.\n  \n \n  In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S.

{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_2","contents":"Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if The\nInterplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on the\nrocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor & Saylor, a rival firm)\nneither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answering\nethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. It\nwas, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chance\nthere was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worries\nwould be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using\ntheir mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed like\nan incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions of\nasteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space only\nthree weeks.\n  \n \n  The \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea had been Bob Parker's originally.\nNow it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the first\nrich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid.\nUnfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in on\nthat brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers\u2014which persons\nBob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would have\nbefore this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants.\nNow that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate to\nget it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might get\nwind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits.\nWhich was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor & Saylor made\nno pretense of being scrupulous.\n  \n \n  Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, the\nmagnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. They\ncame to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge and\n\"down\" the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parker\nhappily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface.\nBy the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar,\nbut he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn't\nuse it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, and\nthen sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, tore\natoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. The\nradiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams to\nthe atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowly\nup and up\u2014past tungsten, past iridium, past gold\u2014\n  \n \n  Bob Parker said, in astonishment, \"Hell! There's something screwy about\nthis business. Look at that point\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer any\nfurther. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,\n  \n \n  \"May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?\"\n  \n \n  Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and\nthe lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as\nhe could inside the \"aquarium\"\u2014the glass helmet, and found himself\nlooking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the\nasteroid \"below.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ma'am,\" said Bob, blinking, \"did you say something?\"\n  \n \n  Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automatically\nreached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.\n  \n \n  \"I said,\" remarked the girl, \"that you should scram off of my asteroid.\nAnd quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken\na reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.\""}

I'm sure you don't understand the conditions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The girl turned and drew a gun from a holster. It was a spasticizer,\nand it was three times as big as her gloved hand.\n  \n \n  \"I understand conditions better than you do,\" she said. \"You want\nto move this asteroid from its orbit and haul it back to Earth.\nUnfortunately, this is my home, by common law. Come back in a month. I\ndon't expect to be here then.\"\n  \n \n  \"A month!\" Parker burst the word out. He started to sweat, then his\nface became grim. He took two slow steps toward the girl. She blinked\nand lost her composure and unconsciously backed up two steps. About\ntwenty steps away was her small dumbbell-shaped ship, so shiny and\nunscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved\nsurface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would\nbe too late!\n  \n \n  He said grimly, \"Don't worry. I don't intend to pull any rough stuff.\nI just want you to listen to reason. You've taken a whim to stay on\nan asteroid that doesn't mean anything to you one way or another. But\nto us\u2014to me and Queazy here\u2014it means our business. We got an order\nfor this asteroid. Some screwball millionaire wants it for a backyard\nwedding see? We get five hundred and fifty thousand dollars for it!\nIf we don't take this asteroid to Earth before June 2, we go back to\nSatterfield City and work the rest of our lives in the glass factories.\nDon't we, Queazy?\"\n  \n \n  Queazy said simply, \"That's right, miss. We're in a spot. I assure you\nwe didn't expect to find someone living here.\"\n  \n \n  The girl holstered her spasticizer, but her completely inhospitable\nexpression did not change. She put her hands on the bulging hips of her\nspace-suit. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Now I understand the conditions. Now we\nboth understand each other. G'bye again. I'm staying here and\u2014\" she\nsmiled sweetly \"\u2014it may interest you to know that if I let you have\nthe asteroid you'll save your business, but I'll meet a fate worse than\ndeath! So that's that.\"\n  \n \n  Bob recognized finality when he saw it. \"Come on, Queazy,\" he said\nfuming. \"Let this brat have her way. But if I ever run across her\nwithout a space-suit on I'm going to give her the licking of her life,\nright where it'll do the most good!\"\n  \n \n  He turned angrily, but Queazy grabbed his arm, his mouth falling open.\nHe pointed off into space, beyond the girl.\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"What's wha\u2014\n   \n   Oh!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Bob Parker's stomach caved in. A few hundred feet away, floating\ngently toward the asteroid, came another ship\u2014a ship a trifle bigger\nthan their own. The girl turned, too. They heard her gasp. In another\nsecond, Bob was standing next to her. He turned the audio-switch to his\nheadset off, and spoke to the girl by putting his helmet against hers.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me, miss,\" he snapped earnestly, when she tried to draw\naway. \"Don't talk by radio. That ship belongs to the Saylor brothers!\nOh, Lord, that this should happen! Somewhere along the line, we've been\ndouble-crossed. Those boys are after this asteroid too, and they won't\nhesitate to pull any rough stuff. We're in this together, understand?\nWe got to back each other up.\"\n  \n \n  The girl nodded dumbly. Suddenly she seemed to be frightened.\n\"It's\u2014it's very important that this\u2014this asteroid stay right where it\nis,\" she said huskily. \"What\u2014what will they do?\""}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_4","contents":"Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue\nsparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic\nclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and\nfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood\nsurveying the three who faced them.\n  \n \n  The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their\ndarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n  \n \n  \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you\nthink of this situation Billy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his\nheels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have\nto take steps.\"\n  \n \n  The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling\nlaughter.\n  \n \n  Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an\nethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled\u2014and his smile remained fixed,\ndangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came\nabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave\nback a step, as he saw their intentions.\n  \n \n  \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll\nreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n  \n \n  It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of\nthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of\nthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained\nchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at\nQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He\nhurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid\nand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n  \n \n  At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his\nhand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked\nthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something\ncrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar\nplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,\nand his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,\nbefore the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete\ndarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.\n  \n \n  What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,\nhe didn't care. Then\u2014lights out."}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_5","contents":"Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. He\nopened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sun\nswept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base of\nhis skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There was\nno asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space.\nAlone in a space-suit.\n  \n \n  \"Queazy!\" he whispered. \"Queazy! I'm running out of air!\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer from Queazy. With sick eyes, Bob studied the\noxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds!\nThat meant he had been floating around out here\u2014how long? Days at\nleast\u2014maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a dose\nof spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to the\nsnapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animation\nthat his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fight\nagainst panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He was\nprobably scrawny. And he was hungry!\n  \n \n  \"I'll starve,\" he thought. \"Or suffocate to death first!\"\n  \n \n  He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes,\nthen hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enough\nair in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hoping\nthat somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the same\ncondition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers.\nMurderers, both of them! Up until this time, he had merely thought of\nthem as business rivals. If he ever got out of this\u2014\n  \n \n  He groaned. He never would get out of it! After another hour, he was\ngasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy's\nname once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strength\nto call it.\n  \n \n  And this time the headset spoke back!\n  \n \n  Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed with\nstatic, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound in\nhis throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he saw\na ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size against\nthe backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in his\nears.\n  \n \n  He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and the\ngirl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot. His\n\"aquarium\" was unbuckled and good air washed over his streaming face.\nThe sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lying\non a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in his\nclearing eyes and he knew he was alive\u2014and going to stay that way, for\nawhile anyway.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks, Queazy,\" he said huskily.\n  \n \n  Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from his\nsuddenly brightening face.\n  \n \n  \"Don't thank me,\" he whispered. \"We'd have both been goners if it\nhadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like\nus, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship.\nShe unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gave\nher enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used the\ndirection-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylors\nscattered us far and wide.\" Queazy's broad, normally good-humored face\ntwisted blackly. \"The so and so's didn't care if we lived or died.\"\n  \n \n  Bob saw the girl now, standing a little behind Queazy, looking down at\nhim curiously, but unhappily. Her space-suit was off. She was wearing\nlightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paper\nflower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyes\nwidened on her.\n  \n \n  The girl said glumly, \"I guess you men won't much care for me when you\nfind out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal\u2014Andrew S.\nBurnside's granddaughter!\""}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_6","contents":"Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger.\n  \n \n  \"Say that again?\" he snapped. \"This is some kind of dirty trick you and\nyour grandfather cooked up?\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" she exclaimed. \"No. My grandfather didn't even know there was an\nasteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you\u2014or\nfrom the Saylor brothers. You see\u2014well, my granddad's about the\nstubbornest old hoot-owl in this universe! He's always had his way, and\nwhen people stand in his way, that's just a challenge to him. He's been\nbadgering me for years to marry Mac, and so has Mac\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's Mac?\" Queazy demanded.\n  \n \n  \"My fianc\u00e9, I guess,\" she said helplessly. \"He's one of my granddad's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Granddad's always financing some likely young man and giving\nhim a start in life. Mac has become pretty famous for his Mercurian\nwater-colors\u2014he's an artist. Well, I couldn't hold out any longer.\nIf you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely\n   \n   impossible\n   \n  it\nis to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass of\nnerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid belt\nand picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take\nplace on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I told\nmy grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on top\nof an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten,\nand so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make sure\nthat if somebody\n   \n   did\n   \n  find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be able\nto get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here.\nAsteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them,\nby common law.... So I had everything figured out\u2014except,\" she added\nbitterly, \"the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make sure\nthe asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.\"\n  \n \n  Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and was\ngratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating\nonly a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy.\n  \n \n  \"How long were we floating around out there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us a\nstiff shot.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ouch!\n   \n  \" Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal with\ndetermination. \"Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and your\ngranddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'm\ngoing to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor\nbrothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and\nours both travel on the HH drive\u2014inertia-less. But the asteroid has\nplenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a\nlong, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with them\na few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have a\nfling at getting the asteroid back!\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"You mean\u2014\" she cried. Then her attractive face\nfell. \"Oh,\" she said. \"\n   \n   Oh!\n   \n  And when you get it back, you'll land it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Bob said grimly. \"We're in business. For us, it's a\nmatter of survival. If the by-product of delivering the asteroid is\nyour marriage\u2014sorry! But until we do get the asteroid back, we three\ncan work as a team if you're willing. We'll fight the other problem out\nlater. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled tremulously. \"Okay, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  Queazy looked from one to another of them. He waved his hand scornfully\nat Bob. \"You're plain nuts,\" he complained. \"How do you propose to go\nabout convincing the Saylor brothers they ought to let us have the\nasteroid back? Remember, commercial ships aren't allowed to carry\nlong-range weapons. And we couldn't ram the Saylor brothers' ship\u2014not\nwithout damaging our own ship just as much. Go ahead and answer that.\"\n  \n \n  Bob looked at Queazy dismally. \"The old balance-wheel,\" he groaned at\nStarre. \"He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. All\nI know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In the\nmeantime, Starre\u2014ahem\u2014none of us has eaten in three weeks...?\"\n  \n \n  Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward the\ngalley."}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_7","contents":"Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after five\ndays out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth;\nprobably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn't\nattach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailed\nastern, attached by a long cable.\n  \n \n  Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifth\nday Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and she\ngently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.\n  \n \n  \"Even\n   \n   I\n   \n  know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder,\nBob. That switch is for the\u2014ah\u2014the anathern tube, you told me.

The gravitonic field affects\nevery atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We could\ngo from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second just\nlike that!\"\n  \n \n  He snapped his fingers. \"No acceleration effects. This type of ship,\nnecessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move in\nany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motion\nat\u2014Oh, hell!\" Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making him\nshake. He took her hand. \"Starre,\" he said desperately, \"I've got to\ntell you something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She jerked her hand away. \"No,\" she exclaimed in an almost frightened\nvoice. \"You can't tell me.

Suddenly, he turned back to\nthe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely to\nthe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell ship\ntrailing astern.\n  \n \n  \"There's your ship, Starre.\" He jabbed his finger at it. \"I've got a\nfeeling\u2014and I can't put the thought into concrete words\u2014that somehow\nthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back lies\nthere. But how?\n   \n   How?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it was\nattached around her ship's narrow midsection.\n  \n \n  She shook her head helplessly. \"It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"A yo-yo?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.\" She was belligerent.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   yo-yo\n   \n  !\" Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he\ngot out of the chair so fast. \"Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!\"\n  \n \n  He disappeared from the room. \"Queazy!\" he shouted. \"\n   \n   Queazy, I've got\nit!\n   \n  \""}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_8","contents":"It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,\nfastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's\nnarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to\ntwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and\nreinforced.\n  \n \n  The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob\nParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of\ncosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into\nstrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the\nend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy\nsnapped his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the\nSaylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n  \n \n  They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had\ndiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid\non their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the\nMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to\nthe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred\nthousand miles from Earth!\n  \n \n  \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within\nnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was\nspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere\nvaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship\nwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant\nsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n  \n \n  Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n  \n \n  Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then\nsent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten\nmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n  \n \n  There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,\nscornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm\nthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,\nfor Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal's\nlittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n  \n \n  It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid\nlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a\nfantastic spinning cannon ball.\n  \n \n  \"It's going to hit!\"\n  \n \n  The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship\nreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of\ncompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back\nup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left."}
{"id":"COSMIC_YO-YO_9","contents":"Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuver\nfor the \"yo-yo\" could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It was\nticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used\nexactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of\nthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in\nhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost\nexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid\ndividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released\nagain.\n  \n \n  All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor\nbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.\nBut by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with\nbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid\nbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for\nthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing\nit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came\nspinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and\nagain the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n  \n \n  And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the\nSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the\nhand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to\nthe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had\nreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.\n  \n \n  Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This\ntime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.\nBob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish\ncommunication.\n  \n \n  Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the\ntelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in\nthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n  \n \n  \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our\nstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless\nyou release the asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n  \n \n  He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at\nzero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n  \n \n  For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a\ndoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size\nwith a strangled yell.\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in\nsuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as\nheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling\nprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was\napparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,\ntheir ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for\na second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from\nits still-intact jets.\n  \n \n  The battle was won!"}

{"id":"DEATH_STAR_1","contents":"DEATH STAR\n  \n \n  By TOM PACE\n  \n \n  Trapped by the most feared of space pirates\n   \n  Devil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for\n   \n  his life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\n   \n  pinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Starrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\n  \n \n  Ten minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\n  \n \n  For eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\n  \n \n  That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\n  \n \n  However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\n  \n \n  It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\n  \n \n  His fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\n  \n \n  The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\n  \n \n  Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\n  \n \n  The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\n  \n \n  Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\n  \n \n  He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\n  \n \n  While a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\n  \n \n  If his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl."}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_2","contents":"He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n  \n \n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n  \n \n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\n  \n \n  Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\n  \n \n  Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\n  \n \n  Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n  \n \n  \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\n  \n \n  Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull."}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_3","contents":"When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon."}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_4","contents":"Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\n  \n \n  He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\n  \n \n  Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\n  \n \n  The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\n  \n \n  A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\n  \n \n  Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\n  \n \n  The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\n  \n \n  The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\n  \n \n  The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\n  \n \n  Which was right, in a way.\n  \n \n  Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\n  \n \n  Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\n  \n \n  Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\n  \n \n  It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\n  \n \n  Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\n  \n \n  But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\n  \n \n  It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him."}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_5","contents":"At first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  In a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say!

I\n   \n   knew\n   \n  what that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\n   \n   heard\n   \n  him say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n  \n \n  \"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\n  \n \n  Star took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\n   \n   are\n   \n  you? What are\nyou doing here?\"\n  \n \n  She said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\n   \n   Blade\nCosmian\n   \n  ' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\n  \n \n  Anne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\n  \n \n  Star whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\n  \n \n  It must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\n  \n \n  Between the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\n  \n \n  His eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\n  \n \n  And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood."}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_6","contents":"Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n  \n \n  \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n  \n \n  \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n  \n \n  \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\n  \n \n  Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\n  \n \n  It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\n  \n \n  He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\n  \n \n \n \n  And Devil Garrett died.\n  \n \n  There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\n  \n \n  And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\n  \n \n  Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\n  \n \n  Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\n  \n \n  The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\""}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_7","contents":"\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\""}
{"id":"DEATH_STAR_8","contents":"He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ...

She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months.

In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?"}
{"id":"DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_2","contents":"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\n  \n \n  The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\n   \n   did\n   \n  the\nthug want?\n  \n \n  Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\n  \n \n  And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n  \n \n  \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\n  \n \n  He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\n  \n \n  A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\n  \n \n  Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\n  \n \n  The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n  \n \n  \"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\""}

Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\n  \n \n  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\n  \n \n  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\n  \n \n  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\n  \n \n  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\n  \n \n  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n  \n \n  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\""}

He could feel the rush of air as the assailant\nshot by.\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.\n  \n \n  Echoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling\nthat no one was going to come to his assistance.\n  \n \n  \"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he\nmissed.

That is, it had been a lighter a few\nseconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected\nstiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical\ninstrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its\nfunction, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.\n  \n \n  \"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but\nhe can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare.\nWhat he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep\nyou posted below the level of his hearing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against\nthe wall.\n  \n \n  \"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet.\nLow.\"\n  \n \n  Sickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of\na miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately,\nhis estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance,\nthe soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His\nopponent gasped and broke away.\n  \n \n  \"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got\nhim. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's\nafraid.\"\n  \n \n  Attack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some\ndidn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent\nfell to the ground, gasped and was silent.\n  \n \n  Cassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near\nthe water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't\nmove.\n  \n \n  \"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely\nperceptible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.\n  \n \n  Foam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed\nfrom cuts on the face.\n  \n \n  \"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche."}
{"id":"DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_5","contents":"Horrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but\nwould the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to\ninvestigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would\nquestion him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what\ncould he do about it?\n  \n \n  Suppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney\n21?\n  \n \n  Grimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of\nthis. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body\ndata\u2014a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles\nof no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount\nof money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A\npicture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which\nresembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.\n  \n \n  Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed\nto be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of\ngetting to Tunney 21.\n  \n \n  Right now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the\nboulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.\n  \n \n  He bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him.\nBefore he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly\ntrying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he\nwas forced to the ground.\n  \n \n  He threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps\nrushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping\nby way of water.\n  \n \n  Whoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man\nI've ever been strangled by.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the\nbasic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I\nchecked him, he had no heartbeat.\"\n  \n \n  \"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted\nCassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't\n   \n   wanted\n   \n  to kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the\npolice.\n  \n \n  He needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second\ntime he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was\nsuccessful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He\nsqueezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.\n  \n \n  Something, however, was missing\u2014his wallet.\n  \n \n  The thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle.\nPersistent fellow. Damned persistent.\n  \n \n  It really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the\nsupposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police.\nNow he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It\ncontained more money than his wallet had.\n  \n \n  Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it\nwas more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece\nof plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he\nnow had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for\nanother tab.\n  \n \n  A white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell.\nCuriously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word,\nSTAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried."}

Slowly a new sign formed\non the door.\n  \n \n  TRAVELERS AID BUREAU\n   \n  Murra Foray, First Counselor\n  \n \n  It was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The\nold technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.\n  \n \n  With a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed\nhelp and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.\n  \n \n  Inside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a\nmaze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable.\nTravelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he\nmanaged to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.\n  \n \n  A woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer\neverything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be\navailable for consultation.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he\nasked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily.\n\"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to\nthe first counselor.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the\nscreen.\n  \n \n  Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.\n  \n \n  Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly\nsupplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him,\nCassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of\nhim. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and\nanswers. One thing he drew the line at\u2014why he wanted to go to Tunney\n21 was his own business.\n  \n \n  The first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed,\nthat anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average,\nrather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the\nchin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman."}
{"id":"DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_7","contents":"She glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n  \n \n  \"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n  \n \n  \"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n  \n \n  He could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n  \n \n  \"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\n  \n \n  Close\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\n  \n \n  There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\n  \n \n  His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\n   \n   if he could\n   \n  . Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\n  \n \n  Her voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n  \n \n  \"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\n   \n   Rickrock C\n   \n  arrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  He didn't answer."}

To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n  \n \n  \"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins.

In fact, I may have lost it.\"\n  \n \n  She smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed.

It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n  \n \n  \"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\n   \n   Rickrock C\n   \n  took off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n  \n \n  \"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\n  \n \n  Outsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably."}
{"id":"DELAY_IN_TRANSIT_10","contents":"She was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible.

The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n  \n \n  \"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help.

True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\n  \n \n  But that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\n  \n \n  For the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n  \n \n  \"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\n  \n \n  In effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\n  \n \n  Cassal held his head in his hands.

I don't know\nwhat the details of your hallucination were, but the important part came\nthrough, all right. You thought you'd been to the Moon before. It took\nall the adventure out of the actual flight; it was just a workaday\ntrip.\"\n  \n \n  \"I said it was easy,\" Ish said.\n  \n \n  \"There was no other way to do it! I had to cancel out the thrill that\ncomes from challenging the unknown. You knew what death was like, and\nyou knew what the Moon was like.

The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\""}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_2","contents":"Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't\n   \n   Guns\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pistols\n   \n  ; and it wasn't\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pluto\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n  \n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n  \n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n   \n   zilcon\n   \n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n  \n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator."}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_3","contents":"A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\nadvanced to the footlights.\n  \n \n  \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\nmyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\n  \n \n  There was a roar of applause from the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  audience. When it had\nsubsided, the man continued:\n  \n \n  \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\nto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\nnine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\nsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\nThese questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\nquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\n   \n   planetoles\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\nher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\nscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\n  \n \n  From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\non the dais.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\ndials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\ncoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\nvoice echoed through the theater:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\nhand. She said quietly:\n  \n \n  \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\ntracto-car.\"\n  \n \n  And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\nthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\ncafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\nbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\nor when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\nthe winner.\n  \n \n  It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\nbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.\n  \n \n  The audience in the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  seemed to have lost much of its\noriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\nsignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\n  \n \n  Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\ngeneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\nwere turned in a smile of satisfaction.\n  \n \n  When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\ncrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\noccurred.\n  \n \n  A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\ndragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\nunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\nthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\nan earlier era.\n  \n \n  Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\nman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\nwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\nsnipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\ninto his mouth.\n  \n \n  Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\nrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\nshout derisive epithets.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\nand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\nTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\nwas all but deserted.\n  \n \n  In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men\nought to clamp down.\"\n  \n \n  \"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\"\n  \n \n  She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\nline about her usually smiling lips.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\""}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_4","contents":"For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  \"My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n  \n \n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n  \n \n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  \"All right!\"\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n  \n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night."}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_5","contents":"Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n  \n \n  We had traveled this far by\n   \n   ganet\n   \n  , the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\n   \n   jagua\n   \n  canoes.\n  \n \n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n  \n \n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n  \n \n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n  \n \n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n  \n \n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n  \n \n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n  \n \n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n  \n \n  \"Stand still!\"\n  \n \n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\n  \n \n \n \n   Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\n   \n \n \n \n  I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\""}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_6","contents":"The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n  \n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n   \n   varpa\n   \n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n  \n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n  \n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n  \n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n  \n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away."}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_7","contents":"Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\nwere ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\ncamped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\nabout us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\ndespondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\nfutility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\nfrom turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\nthat all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\n  \n \n  After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\nsteaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\nadvance on foot.\n  \n \n  It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\nsuddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\nThere it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\n   \n   arelium\n   \n  steel,\nhalf buried in the swamp soil.\n  \n \n  \"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\n  \n \n  A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\nquarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\nsuspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\ninsulators.\n  \n \n  Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\nVenusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\ncircle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\n  \n \n  But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\nMoments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\n  \n \n  A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\nMid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\n  \n \n  \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\nclimb slowly.\n  \n \n  The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\nThere was no sign of life.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\n  \n \n  Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\nleft side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\nbare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\nclarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\nlooked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\nswing slowly to and fro.\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\nthe lower hold are probably exposed to a\n   \n   tholpane\n   \n  plate and their\nradiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\n  \n \n  Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\nglass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\n  \n \n  \"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\natomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\nguards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the\nGreen Flames are more accessible.\"\n  \n \n  In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\nthe feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\nvessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\nSuspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\nplate.\n  \n \n  But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\n  \n \n  Grannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\nthe crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single\nmove.\""}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_8","contents":"Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n  \n \n  \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n  \n \n  \"Say that again!\" she cried.\n  \n \n  The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n  \n \n  \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\n   \n   is\n   \n  Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n  \n \n  \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n  \n \n  \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n  \n \n  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n  \n \n  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n  \n \n  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n  \n \n  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n  \n \n  \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n  \n \n  He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n  \n \n  Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled."}
{"id":"Doctor_Universe_9","contents":"Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n  \n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n  \n \n  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n  \n \n  \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n  \n \n  Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n  \n \n  Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n  \n \n  At length she finished.\n  \n \n  \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator.

The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n  \n \n  \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n  \n \n  \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n  \n \n  I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence.

It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw\u2014the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then\u2014\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear\u2014but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself\u2014that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity\u2014that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_2","contents":"The tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n  \n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n  \n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n  \n \n \n \n  Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n  \n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened\u2014one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n  \n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n  \n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n  \n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n  \n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\""}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_3","contents":"Syme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age.

He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought\u2014you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n  \n \n  \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n  \n \n  The man sighed. \"I need a drink.\n   \n   You\n   \n  need a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh\u2014your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n  \n \n  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n  \n \n  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was\u2014his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth\u2014in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n  \n \n  He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n  \n \n  \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!\u2014pardon\u2014seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!\u2014help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  inside him.\n  \n \n  \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n  \n \n  Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming\u2014something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big."}

It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why.

We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_5","contents":"Syme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n  \n \n  Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n  \n \n  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n  \n \n  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n  \n \n  Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n  \n \n  \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n  \n \n  Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n  \n \n  The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What\u2014?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n  \n \n  When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n  \n \n  Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n  \n \n  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece\u2014or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n  \n \n  Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n  \n \n  The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns\u2014strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n  \n \n  Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n  \n \n  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_6","contents":"\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think they'll\u2014\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\n   \n   whooshed\n   \n  into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n  \n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully\u2014a tunnel, now\u2014getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n  \n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\n   \n   Kalis methra\n   \n  ,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\n   \n   seltin guna getal.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n  \n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n  \n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n  \n \n  \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  \"But how\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n  \n \n  He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n  \n \n  Tate looked interested. \"But why this\u2014this gigantic masquerade?\"\n  \n \n  \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n  \n \n  Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you\u2014had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Tate thought again. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\""}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_7","contents":"It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why\u2014\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_8","contents":"It was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n  \n \n  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n  \n \n  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n  \n \n  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n  \n \n  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n  \n \n  At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n  \n \n  He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n  \n \n  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but\u2014I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I\u2014I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n  \n \n  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n  \n \n  Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_9","contents":"They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change."}
{"id":"Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_10","contents":"Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening."}

The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room.

Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return.

{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_2","contents":"When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\""}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_3","contents":"So now here we were at the outer reaches of the Baldric, four travelers\non foot with only the barest necessities in the way of equipment and\nsupplies.\n  \n \n  I walked forward to get a closer view of one of the flagpole trees. And\nthen abruptly I saw something else.\n  \n \n  A queer-looking bird squatted there in the sand, looking up at me.\nSilver in plumage, it resembled a parrot with a crest; and yet it\ndidn't. In some strange way the thing was a hideous caricature.\n  \n \n  \"Look what I found,\" I yelled.\n  \n \n  \"What I found,\" said the cockatoo in a very human voice.\n  \n \n  \"Thunder, it talks,\" I said amazed.\n  \n \n  \"Talks,\" repeated the bird, blinking its eyes.\n  \n \n  The cockatoo repeated my last statement again, then rose on its short\nlegs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky. Xartal,\nthe Martian illustrator, already had a notebook in his hands and was\nsketching a likeness of the creature.\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later we were on the move again. We saw more silver\ncockatoos and more flagpole trees. Above us, the great disc of Jupiter\nbegan to descend toward the horizon.\n  \n \n  And then all at once Grannie stopped again, this time at the top of a\nhigh ridge. She shielded her eyes and stared off into the plain we had\njust crossed.\n  \n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said to me in a strange voice, \"look down there and\ntell me what you see.\"\n  \n \n  I followed the direction of her hand and a shock went through me from\nhead to foot. Down there, slowly toiling across the sand, advanced a\nparty of four persons. In the lead was a little old lady in a black\ndress. Behind her strode a grizzled Earth man in a flop-brimmed hat,\nanother Earth man, and a Martian.\n  \n \n \n   Detail for detail they were a duplicate of ourselves!\n   \n \n \n  \"A mirage!\" said Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  But it wasn't a mirage. As the party came closer, we could see that\ntheir lips were moving, and their voices became audible. I listened in\nawe. The duplicate of myself was talking to the duplicate of Grannie\nAnnie, and she was replying in the most natural way.\n  \n \n  Steadily the four travelers approached. Then, when a dozen yards away,\nthey suddenly faded like a negative exposed to light and disappeared.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it?\" I said in a hushed voice.\n  \n \n  Grannie shook her head. \"Might be a form of mass hypnosis superinduced\nby some chemical radiations,\" she replied. \"Whatever it is, we'd better\nwatch our step. There's no telling what might lie ahead.\"\n  \n \n  We walked after that with taut nerves and watchful eyes, but we saw no\nrepetition of the \"mirage.\" The wind continued to blow ceaselessly, and\nthe sand seemed to grow more and more powdery.\n  \n \n  For some time I had fixed my gaze on a dot in the sky which I supposed\nto be a high-flying cockatoo. As that dot continued to move across the\nheavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it.\n  \n \n  \"It's a kite,\" she nodded. \"There should be a car attached to it\nsomewhere.\"\n  \n \n  She offered no further explanation, but a quarter of an hour later as\nwe topped another rise a curious elliptical car with a long slanting\nwindscreen came into view. Attached to its hood was a taut wire which\nslanted up into the sky to connect with the kite.\n  \n \n  A man was driving and when he saw us, he waved. Five minutes later\nGrannie was shaking his hand vigorously and mumbling introductions.\n  \n \n  \"This is Jimmy Baker,\" she said. \"He manages\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  , and\nhe's the real reason we're here.\"\n  \n \n  I decided I liked Baker the moment I saw him. In his middle thirties,\nhe was tall and lean, with pleasant blue eyes which even his sand\ngoggles could not conceal.\n  \n \n  \"I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, Grannie,\" he said. \"If\nanybody can help me, you can.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie's eyes glittered. \"Trouble with the mine laborers?\" she\nquestioned."}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_4","contents":"Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we\nheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an\nelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these\nadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the\ncar's ability to move in any direction.\n  \n \n  \"If I weren't a realist, I'd say that\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  has been\nbewitched,\" he began slowly. \"We pay our men high wages and give them\nexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.\nUp until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and\nspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Red Spot Fever?\" Grannie looked at him curiously.\n  \n \n  Jimmy Baker nodded. \"The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness\non the part of the patient. Then they disappear.\"\n  \n \n  He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.\n  \n \n  \"They walk out into the Baldric,\" he continued, \"and nothing can stop\nthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as\nthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes\nare turned, they give us the slip.\"\n  \n \n  \"But surely you must have some idea of where they go,\" Grannie said.\n  \n \n  Baker lit a cigarette. \"There's all kinds of rumors,\" he replied, \"but\nnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie\nahead of us.\"\n  \n \n  I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between\na rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of\ntranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were\nperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but\nthey didn't move.\n  \n \n  After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,\na door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was\ndrawn.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Baker,\" he said breathlessly, \"seventy-five workers at Shaft Four\nhave headed out into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.\n  \n \n  \"Shaft Four, eh?\" he repeated. \"That's our principal mine. If the fever\nspreads there, I'm licked.\"\n  \n \n  He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. Silent\nXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got his\nnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remained\nstanding.\n  \n \n  Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself to\nthe bottle of Martian whiskey there.\n  \n \n  \"There must be ways of stopping this,\" she said. \"Have you called in\nany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send the\nmen away until the plague has died down?\"\n  \n \n  Baker shook his head. \"Three doctors from Callisto were here last\nmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,\nI may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company is\nchartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failure\nto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose all\nrights.\"\n  \n \n  A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. A\nman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said \"Okay\" and\nthrew off the switch.\n  \n \n  \"The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric,\" he said\nslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.\nGrannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.\n  \n \n  \"Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where that\ncorridor is at its widest,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Baker looked up. \"That's right. We only began operations there a\ncomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix that\nruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  , our rival, in a year.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run up\nthere,\" she said. \"But first I want to see your laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lower\nlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the length\nof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and began\ndropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or four\nWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a small\ndynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wire\nand other items.\n  \n \n  The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and the\nMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began to\nroll down the ramp."}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_5","contents":"Not until they had vanished in the desert haze did I sense the\nloneliness of this outpost. With that loneliness came a sudden sense of\nforeboding. Had I been a fool to let Grannie go? I thought of her, an\nold woman who should be in a rocking chair, knitting socks. If anything\nhappened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself and\nneither would her millions of readers.\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled.\n  \n \n  \"Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.\"\n  \n \n  A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a long\ncorridor which ended at a staircase.\n  \n \n  \"Let's look around,\" I said.\n  \n \n  We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the second\nfloor. Here were the general offices of\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  , and\nthrough glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines and\nreport tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore was\nbeing packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end a\ndoor to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back in\na swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel.\n  \n \n  \"C'mon in,\" he said, seeing us. \"If you want a look at your friends,\nhere they are.\"\n  \n \n  He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent a\nslow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, then\ncoalesced into a three-dimensional scene.\n  \n \n  It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from the\nrear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me,\nwere Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standing\ndirectly behind them.\n  \n \n  \"It's Mr. Baker's own invention,\" the operator said. \"An improvement on\nthe visiphone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and its\npassengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure.\" The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voice\nentered the room. It stopped abruptly. \"The machine uses a lot of\npower,\" the operator said, \"and as yet we haven't got much.\"\n  \n \n  The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappeared\nsomewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myself\nposted of Grannie's movements.\n  \n \n  Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. When\nwe returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing.\nI went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face of\nAntlers Park flashed on the screen.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" he said in his friendly way. \"I see you arrived all right. Is\nMiss Flowers there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,\" I said. \"There's\ntrouble up there. Red spot fever.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fever, eh?\" repeated Park. \"That's a shame. Is there anything I can\ndo?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell me,\" I said, \"has your company had any trouble with this plague?\"\n  \n \n  \"A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the\nother side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemists\ngave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think of\nit, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula.\nI haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have any\ntrouble, I shouldn't either.\"\n  \n \n  We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactly\nan hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room.\n  \n \n  Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on their\nconversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular array\nof flagpole trees, with the sky dotted by high-flying cockatoos.\n  \n \n  \"There's an eyrie over there,\" Jimmy Baker was saying. \"We might as\nwell camp beside it.\""}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_6","contents":"Moments later a rude circle of flagpole trees loomed ahead. Across the\ntop of them was stretched a translucent web. Jimmy and Grannie got out\nof the car and began making camp. Xartal remained in his seat. He was\ndrawing pictures on large pieces of pasteboard, and as I stood there in\nthe visiscreen room, I watched him.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it, the Martian was clever. He would make\na few rapid lines on one of the pasteboards, rub it a little to get\nthe proper shading and then go on to the next. In swift rotation\nlikenesses of Ezra Karn, of myself, of Jimmy Baker, and of Antlers Park\ntook form.\n  \n \n  Ezra spoke over my shoulder. \"He's doing scenes for Grannie's new\nbook,\" he said. \"The old lady figures on using the events here for a\nplot.\n   \n   Look at that damned nosy bird!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  A silver cockatoo had alighted on the kite car and was surveying\ncuriously Xartal's work. As each drawing was completed, the bird\nscanned it with rapt attention. Abruptly it flew to the top of the\neyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird\ncompanions.\n  \n \n  And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A\ngroup of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and\nmoving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n  \n \n  With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw\nthe image of Jimmy Baker.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   real\n   \n  Jimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this\nincredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. \"I've got it!\" she said.\n\"Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images.\nThey're Xartal's drawings!\""}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_7","contents":"\"Don't you see,\" the lady continued. \"Everything that Xartal put on\npaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos\nare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power\nof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental\nimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a\npowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is\nthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common\nfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain\nvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light\nfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.\"\n  \n \n  The Larynx manager nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"But why don't the\nbirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and\nmade a greater impression on their brains,\" Grannie replied.\n  \n \n  Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate\nof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the\nimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" the operator said. \"I've used too much power already. Have to\ngive the generators a chance to build it up again.\"\n  \n \n  Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.\n  \n \n  \"That explains something at any rate,\" the old prospector said. \"But\nhow about that Red spot fever?\"\n  \n \n  On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened\nit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been\nattacked by the strange malady.\n  \n \n  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had\nreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while\nsleeping or lounging in the barracks.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that\nled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low\nrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.\n  \n \n  Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those\nbunks some thirty men lay sleeping.\n  \n \n  The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood\nthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk\ntoward that window.\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull\nmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The central\npart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as\nI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.\n  \n \n  All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red\nrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to\nconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork\nserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens\nslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.\n  \n \n  I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.\nBack in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:\n  \n \n  \"Turn it on!\"\n  \n \n  The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.\nI stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, nor\nwas Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the\ncontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice."}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_8","contents":"Ezra Karn jabbed my elbow. \"Grannie's coming back. I thought she'd be\ngetting sick of this blamed moon.\"\n  \n \n  It didn't make sense. In all the years I'd known Annabella C.

There's\nsomething screwy here.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later in another kite car we were driving at a fast clip\nthrough the powdery sands of the Baldric. And before long we saw\nanother car approaching.\n  \n \n  It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her\nprim way next to Antlers Park. Park said:\n  \n \n  \"We left the others at the mine. Miss Flowers is going back with me to\nmy offices to help me improve the formula for that new antitoxin.\"\n  \n \n  He waved his hand, and the car moved off. I watched it as it sped\nacross the desert, and a growing suspicion began to form in my mind.\nThen, like a knife thrust, the truth struck me.\n  \n \n  \"Ezra!\" I yelled, swinging the car. \"That wasn't Grannie!\n   \n   That was one\nof those damned cockatoo images.\n   \n  We've got to catch him.\"\n  \n \n  The other car was some distance ahead now. Park looked back and saw us\nfollowing. He did something to the kite wire, and his car leaped ahead.\n  \n \n  I threw the speed indicator hard over. Our kite was a huge box affair\nwith a steady powerful pull to the connecting wire. Park's vehicle\nwas drawn by a flat triangular kite that dove and fluttered with each\nvariance of the wind. Steadily we began to close in.\n  \n \n  The manager of Interstellar Voice turned again, and something glinted\nin his hand. There was a flash of purple flame, and a round hole\nappeared in our windscreen inches above Karn's head.\n  \n \n  \"Heat gun!\" Ezra yelled.\n  \n \n  Now we were rocketing over the sand dunes, winding in and out between\nthe flagpole trees. I had to catch that car I told myself. Grannie\nAnnie's very life might be at stake, not to mention the lives of\nhundreds of mine workers. Again Park took aim and again a hole\nshattered our windscreen.\n  \n \n  The wind shifted and blew from another quarter. The box kite soared,\nbut the triangular kite faltered. Taking advantage of Park's loss of\nspeed, I raced alongside.\n  \n \n  The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could\nuse it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and\nsent it coiling across the intervening space.\n  \n \n  The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only\nthing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a\nhalt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free\nfrom his grasp.\n  \n \n  \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded.\n  \n \n  The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the\ntrigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest.\n  \n \n  \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance hidden by wall of ... flagpole trees.\""}
{"id":"DOUBLE_TROUBLE_9","contents":"I leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now the\ncountry began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to group\nthemselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, as\nif to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetrate\nthat wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.\n  \n \n  Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began\nagain. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as\ngranite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance\nblack bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or\ndoorway between.\n  \n \n  I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power\nwith an exclamation of astonishment.\n  \n \n  There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was\nGrannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.\n  \n \n  \"Grannie!\" I yelled. \"What're you doing here?

Come along, and I'll show you.\"\n  \n \n  She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep\ngorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing\nclose. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.\n  \n \n  Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of\nLarynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down\nthe center of the gorge toward the entrance.\n  \n \n  But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen\nhad been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like\ncontrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of\nbluish radiance spewed from its open end.

They're friendly enough.\"\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground\ngroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\nnative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, that\nis\u2014right down into the mud.

She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing?

Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face.

His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\""}
{"id":"DOUBLECROSS_3","contents":"The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along the\nmain street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except\nfor deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the\nentrance to the town's Hall of Justice.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We\nhave ample time.\"\n  \n \n  He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching\nthe faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.\nIngra? Her aunt? One of the men?\n  \n \n  The right answer leaped up at him.\n   \n   They all are\n   \n  , he thought.\n   \n   Not one\nof them understands what this means. They're afraid.\n   \n \n \n  He clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was\ndriving. \"Let's get this done with.\"\n  \n \n  She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her\neyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy\ncar jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite\ndark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,\nilluminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the\njungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The\npresent shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off\nagain, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\n  \n \n  A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence\nthat followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\n  \n \n  The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the\nbrakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them\nfrom the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\n  \n \n  Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened\nthe door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard\nit was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is\nthat not permitted?\"\n  \n \n  The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The\norder was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\n  \n \n  Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It\nis urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a\ncomplicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\n  \n \n  Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced by\na sudden flare of understanding\u2014and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\n\"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this\u2014\"\nHe strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was\nfaster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.\nHe hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against\nthe splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan\nsavagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like\nnails\u2014Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength\nin his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial\nadvantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard\nlay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had\nruthlessly pounded it against the road.\n  \n \n \n \n   Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\n   \n \n \n \n  Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the\npetrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,\nthen reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over\nthe shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the\njungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be\nno trace.\n  \n \n  Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now\nthere is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep\na watch for other guards.\""}

With the amount of atomite in\nthat bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a\nground-shaking crash.\n  \n \n  Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting\noff the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached\nfor him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of\nthe car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,\nsent it lumbering back down the road.

What did it mean?\nWas it an error that the girl should die with the others?\n  \n \n  There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was\ndriven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And\nsince he could not know which was the one who had received the marked\nslip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\n  \n \n  He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the\njungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed\nlights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by\nits own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circling\nfigures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own.\nThey would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those\nslim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the\nside of the ship.\n  \n \n  Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.\nHe had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned.

{"id":"DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_2","contents":"It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\n  \n \n  The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\nand little grubby things just looking for\n   \n   you\n   \n  to crawl on. If you\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells\u2014I've\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\nnot for me.\n  \n \n  We have a place in the Ship like that\u2014the Third Level\u2014but it's only a\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n  \n \n  When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\n  \n \n  In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\nJimmy\u2014if he would get back alive.\n  \n \n  It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n  \n \n  Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\nkeep the population steady.\n  \n \n  I began to check my gear out\u2014sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\nbad moment any longer.\n  \n \n  The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it\u2014one day in\nthirty gone.\n  \n \n  I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\nthings in mind\u2014stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n  \n \n  No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n  \n \n  I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November\u2014too close to\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\nlook forward to.\n  \n \n  In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n  \n \n  On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\nidentify.\n  \n \n  One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\ndraft animals.\n  \n \n  The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\n   \n   could\n   \n  have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses."}
{"id":"DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_3","contents":"We'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the\nroad. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\n  \n \n  I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined\nbend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There\nwere five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures\nalive.\n  \n \n  They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and\nknobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for\nfaces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were\nalmost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They\nmade a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded\nalong.\n  \n \n  I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the\nmen on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as\ncats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line\nand he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That\none wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\n  \n \n  He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he\nhad a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we\nreached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow\nme. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the\nface he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man\nlooks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That\nwas why I kept riding.\n  \n \n  He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?\nThere be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\n  \n \n  I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it\nwas that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though.\nGenerally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say\nanything. It seemed smart.\n  \n \n  \"Where be you from?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  I pointed to the road behind us.\n  \n \n  \"And where be you going?\"\n  \n \n  I pointed ahead. No other way to go.\n  \n \n  He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and\nDaddy, who should know better.\n  \n \n  We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd\nbetter ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\n  \n \n  He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a\nmouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether\neverybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International\nEnglish spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit\nwith him.\n  \n \n  One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been\nwatching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\n  \n \n  \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at\nall. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\n  \n \n  The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he\nexpected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\n  \n \n  The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us\nto Forton for protection.\"\n  \n \n  I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving\nalong and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.\nI felt uncomfortable.\n  \n \n  I said, \"I don't think so.\"\n  \n \n  What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and\nreached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\n  \n \n  I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over\nwith the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he\ndidn't want to be fried.\n  \n \n  I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\n  \n \n  They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\n  \n \n  When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\"\n  \n \n  They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I\ncould see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with\nnarrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling\ntones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It\nsurprised me. I didn't think I sounded\n   \n   that\n   \n  mean. I decided he just\ndidn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\n  \n \n  After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the\ncreatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get\nthem now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next\nbend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and\nthe creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\n  \n \n  I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my\nmind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes\nI even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my\ngreat-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,\nnestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than\nthe last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\n  \n \n  My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\n  \n \n  The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave\nway to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of\nthe green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before\nhadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\n  \n \n  But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or\nsomething.\n  \n \n  I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody\nquestioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving\nsilently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've\nseen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\n  \n \n  Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received\na jolt that sickened me.\n  \n \n  By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were\ncold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to\na gallop.\n  \n \n  I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all\nstone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were\nno machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the\nedge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the\nwindow\u2014INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\n  \n \n  But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't\nsee one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There\nwere little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All\nthe boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why\nHorst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but\nI decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the\nclocks tick on this planet.\n  \n \n  But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They\nswarmed. I saw a family come out of a house\u2014a father and\n   \n   four\n   \n  children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me\nthen\u2014these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I\nclosed my eyes until it passed."}

George Fuhonin's style. I\ntriggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't\nknow why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\n  \n \n  The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\nhead, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\nbucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain\nidiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\noverhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.\nNot too different, but not ours.\n  \n \n \n \n  One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here.

{"id":"DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_5","contents":"I felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to\na campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't\nhelp but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent\nbuildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more\nthan a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.\n  \n \n  I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,\nhis wife and their three children. The kids were running around and\nplaying, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father\ncame and pulled him away.\n  \n \n  The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said\nhello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I\nhad two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until\nthat moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these\nkids. Isn't that horrible?\n  \n \n  About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man\nI had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He\nhad white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never\nseen before.\n  \n \n  When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered\naround. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the\nchildren tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go,\nso the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd\naccent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,\nit seemed just right.\n  \n \n  It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in\na house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a\nnice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony\nerrand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the\npoor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the\nhandkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her\ndear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to\ndefeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\n  \n \n  I wished for the same for myself.\n  \n \n  The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids\noff to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the\ncamp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I\ncouldn't see far into the dark.\n  \n \n  A voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this\none, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're\nnot.\"\n  \n \n  Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the\ncampfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the\nfire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets\nand mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now\nwhat they used the high-walled pen for.\n  \n \n  I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the\nnight. I should have used my head.

It was not time to correct him, but I\ndidn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\n  \n \n  \"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed\na courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL\nJUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or\nsomething stuffy like that.\n  \n \n  He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I\nknew I'd goofed.\n  \n \n  \"Boy, boy.

Hold on.\"\n  \n \n  I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind\nand the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good\nenough,\" to the others who'd come up behind me.\n  \n \n  I felt like a fool.\n  \n \n  Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and\nsaid in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was\nnatural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it\nuntil it cracked and fell apart.\n  \n \n  Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard\nthat my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\n  \n \n  I said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\n  \n \n  It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut.

Only it's worse for us, because they\ncouldn't see that anything had changed. We can.\n   \n \n \n  \"You need something to cling to,\" she heard Madge say. \"Dr. Kometevsky\nwas the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this\nmight happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of\nthe man.\"\n  \n \n  She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and\nanxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much\nworse.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, there are several more convincing alternate\nexplanations....\" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that\nthere weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated,\nsurely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the\nDisordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance\nphrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist.\nAnd in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you\nadmitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen\nholes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: \"Besides, if\nPhobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been\npicked up by now by 'scope or radar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?\" Madge questioned.\n\"Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but\nI think' I'm right.\"\n  \n \n  And of course she was.\n  \n \n  She swung the book under her arm. \"Whew, it's heavy,\" she observed,\nadding in slightly scandalized tones, \"Never been microfilmed.\" She\nsmiled nervously and looked them up and down. \"Going to a party?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket\njustified the question, but they shook their heads.\n  \n \n  \"Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,\" Celeste said,\nwhile Theodor explained, \"As it happens, we're bound on business\nconnected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute\na sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.\nAnd since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're\ngoing to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical\nsleight-of-hand.\"\n  \n \n  Madge nodded. \"Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be\noff. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.\" She\ngave them a woeful grin. \"See you when the Earth jumps.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor said to Celeste, \"Come on, dear. We'll be late.\"\n  \n \n  But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. \"You know, Teddy,\" she said\nuncomfortably, \"all this reminds me of those old myths where too much\ngood fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much\nluck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World\nGovernment started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that\ncouldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of\nthings, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and\u2014\" she hesitated a\nbit\u2014\"complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where\nam I to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"In me,\" Theodor said promptly.\n  \n \n  \"In you?\" Celeste questioned, walking slowly. \"But you're just\none-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or\nIvan.\"\n  \n \n  \"You angry with me about something?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a\ncrisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,\" Theodor\ntold her warmly. \"You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to\nbe punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from\nHeaven and all that?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.\"\nCeleste smiled. \"I guess none of us realized how much we've come to\ndepend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from\nunder you.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded emphatically. \"All the more reason to get a line on\nwhat's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically\nfar-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory\nPerception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days\nthere's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the\nplanet.

One-third of a chance.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. \"Anyway, Dotty will\nbe there,\" he said. \"Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly\nseemed to need more sleep.\"\n  \n \n  As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of\nthe path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted\nto the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Did you know,\" Theodor said suddenly, \"that in\n   \n   Gulliver's Travels\n   \n  Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two\nmoons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately,\ntoo. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and\nliterature.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop being eerie,\" Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, \"Those\nnames Phobos and Deimos\u2014they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?\"\n  \n \n  Theodor lost a step. \"Fear and Terror,\" he said unwillingly. \"Now\ndon't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of\nmajor and minor ancient gods had been taken\u2014the bodies in the Solar\nSystem are named that way, of course\u2014and these were about all that\nwere available.\"\n  \n \n  It was true, but it didn't comfort him much."}

At\napproximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have\nencountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named\nthe durasphere. It resists their hardest drills, their strongest\ncorrosives. They have extended a side-tunnel at that level for a\nquarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible by the\nmirror-smooth metal surface, show that the durasphere has a slight\ncurvature that is almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth\nitself. The suggestion is that deep borings made anywhere in the world\nwould encounter the durasphere at the same depth.\n  \n \n  \"Second, the movements of the moons of Mars and Jupiter, and\nparticularly the debris left behind by the moons of Mars. Granting\nPhobos and Deimos had duraspheres proportional in size to that of\nEarth, then the debris would roughly equal in amount the material in\nthose two duraspheres' rocky envelopes. The suggestion is that the\ntwo duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes with such titanic\nvelocity as to leave those disrupted envelopes behind.\"\n  \n \n  It was deadly quiet in the committee room.\n  \n \n  \"Thirdly, the disappearances of Ivan and Rosalind, and especially\nthe baffling hint\u2014from Ivan's message in one case and Rosalind's\ndownward-pointing glove in the other\u2014that they were both somehow drawn\ninto the depths of the Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Finally, the dreams of the ESPs, which agree overwhelmingly in the\nfollowing points: A group of beings separate themselves from a godlike\nand telepathic race because they insist on maintaining a degree of\nmental privacy. They flee in great boats or ships of some sort. They\nare pursued on such a scale that there is no hiding place for them\nanywhere in the universe. In some manner they successfully camouflage\ntheir ships. Eons pass and their still-fanatical pursuers do not\npenetrate their secret.

He murmured\nsomething about the\nTroopers, and shuffled alongside\nthe puffing fat man.\n  \n \n  Sol soon realized that their\ndestination was a barber shop.\n  \n \n  Dawes cupped his hands\nover the plate glass and\npeered inside.

His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n  \n \n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers.

HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\""}
{"id":"DUST_UNTO_DUST_2","contents":"Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n  \n \n  Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band?

Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge.

He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then\u2014\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\n  \n \n  Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n  \n \n  Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n  \n \n  Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n  \n \n  Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n  \n \n  They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n  \n \n  Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n  \n \n  \"The shield?\"\n  \n \n  Wass nodded. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\n  \n \n  Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n  \n \n  \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n  \n \n  He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\n  \n \n  It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n  \n \n  Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n  \n \n  A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\n  \n \n  The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n  \n \n  \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n  \n \n  Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n  \n \n  He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n  \n \n  \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Then, more quietly\u2014\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"You too, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\""}
{"id":"DUST_UNTO_DUST_3","contents":"Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all\nhave guns, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\n  \n \n  After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out\nof here, then!\"\n  \n \n  Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the\nmetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a\nhalt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must\nbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around\nthe city would take years.\"\n  \n \n  Martin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level\nleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\n  \n \n  Wass laughed rudely.\n  \n \n  \"Have you a better idea?\"\n  \n \n  Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That\nleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for\nthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\n   \n   dig\n   \n  out?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no\nequipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in\nto themselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\n  \n \n  Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.\nThe incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet\nperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,\ngleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the\ndarkness before the men.\n  \n \n  At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\n  \n \n  Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.\nMetal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down\non them.\n  \n \n  Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in\na circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up\nthere?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with\nhis light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my\nnightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\n  \n \n  Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he\nthought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him\nsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more\nso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the\nthree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,\npast something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another\nsomething which could have been anything at all.\n  \n \n  The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\n  \n \n  The edge of the city\u2014the city which was a dome of force above and a\nbowl of metal below.\n  \n \n  After a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n  \n \n  \"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was\nholding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But\nRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then\u2014\"I can't think of\nanything else.\"\n  \n \n  They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past\nthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all\nlooking different now in the new angles of illumination.\n  \n \n  Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,\nmatchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty\ntriumph in the rear.\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he\nsighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at\nsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and\nthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for\nnow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.\nBut\u2014The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd\never explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and\nMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at\nsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a\nsort of racial insanity.\n  \n \n  No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.\nViewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,\na faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien\nmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\n  \n \n  Then Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\n  \n \n  Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding\nup the procession?\"\n  \n \n  Martin was silent.\n  \n \n  Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It\nwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before\na bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as\nthe combined light of their torches would reach.\n  \n \n  \"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\n  \n \n  Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\n  \n \n  Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section\nof the bank.\n  \n \n  Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they\nwouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\n  \n \n  Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  They were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n  \n \n  \"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by\nthe deadline we may be eating these.\"\n  \n \n  Martin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us\nfind a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no\nwater.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the\ngun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For\na plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.\nMaybe\u2014\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with\nsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"\u2014only the\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere.\""}
{"id":"DUST_UNTO_DUST_4","contents":"They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,\nRodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.\n  \n \n  Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was\nloud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.\n  \n \n  Martin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to\ntake off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin.\nPostpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without\nus and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate\nourselves and God only knows what else and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.\n  \n \n  Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away\nsilently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.\n  \n \n  The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of\nRodney's sobs.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as\na last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die\ngradually\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last\nresort. We still have a little time.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,\nnow that he was up again. \"Martin, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently.\n  \n \n  \"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this\ncity somewhere.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\"\n  \n \n  Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not\nlooking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can\nleave the same way.\"\n  \n \n  Down the ramp again.\n  \n \n  \"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured.\n  \n \n  Rodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\"\n  \n \n  Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,\npicking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the\npresent level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\"\n  \n \n  Eleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\"\n  \n \n  \"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ...\nthink it's the last.\"\n  \n \n  They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of\nartificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.\n  \n \n  Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about\nthe floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are\ncemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Rodney! Stop it!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\"\n  \n \n  \"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They had a war,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Wass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built\nbefore the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\"\n  \n \n  \"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient\nplanet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock\nit off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\"\n  \n \n  They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow\nshapes, looking carefully about them.\n  \n \n  Rodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\"\n  \n \n  Martin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He\nadded dryly, \"Use your imagination.\"\n  \n \n  They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,\nuncertain.\n  \n \n  Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.\n  \n \n  Wass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what the pattern was.\"\n  \n \n  \"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later\nexpeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\"\n  \n \n  Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then\u2014\"Martin! Martin! I think\nI've found something!\"\n  \n \n  Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See?\nRight here.\"\n  \n \n  Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more\nfrom the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of\nthe same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.\n  \n \n  From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped\nand turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\"\n  \n \n  Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily\u2014almost too\neasily\u2014rotating the disk as it turned.\n  \n \n  Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed\nhinge.\n  \n \n  The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the\nsix-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that\ndrifted and eddied directly beneath them.\n  \n \n  Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.\n\"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\"\n  \n \n  Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the\nopening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.\n  \n \n  He was shaking."}
{"id":"DUST_UNTO_DUST_5","contents":"After a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember\nthe wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.\nThen\u2014\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\n  \n \n  Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,\notherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun\nloosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\n  \n \n  Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney\nand he, too, had drawn his gun.\n  \n \n  The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,\noutlined in the light of two torches.\n  \n \n  For a little while he was alone.\n  \n \n  Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014a\ntenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about\nMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,\nobscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange\nobjects.\n  \n \n \n \n  Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering\nspirals.\n  \n \n  Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said\nnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and\nnow, himself.\n  \n \n  \"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n  \n \n  \"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\n  \n \n  Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a\ntorch swinging wildly on the end of it.\n  \n \n  The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently\nrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\n  \n \n  Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip\nof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the\nswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\n  \n \n  Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him\ndisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into\nthe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom\nof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He\nstamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing\njump. He sank no farther than his knees.\n  \n \n  He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest\nedge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long\nas we avoid the drifts.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and\nsank into the dust.\n  \n \n  \"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way,\nI'll go mine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wass!\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\n  \n \n  The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied\nand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were\nhard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n  \n \n  \"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Martin growled.\n  \n \n  There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.\nThe two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously\nplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times\nwithout number.\n  \n \n  Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours,\nMartin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\n  \n \n  Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his\nthroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,\nhis flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.\n  \n \n  A grate.\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\"\n  \n \n  Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now,\nMartin. I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.\n  \n \n  The grate groaned upward and stopped.\n  \n \n  Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he\nbegan to scream.\n  \n \n  Martin switched off his radio, sick.\n  \n \n  He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.\n\"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't\nyou answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"We couldn't do anything for him.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\"\n  \n \n  \"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly.\n  \n \n  Rodney said nothing.\n  \n \n  Then Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't\nunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place like\nthis\u2014!\"\n  \n \n  Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up\ntoward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the\nedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force\nshimmering, almost invisible, about it.\n  \n \n  Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.\nMartin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members\nstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It\nwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed."}

{"id":"END_AS_A_HERO_2","contents":"I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\nreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace.

He'd spare me the mental anguish of\nknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\nwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\npretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'd\nbeen condemned to death.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\nwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\nconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\nrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\nmy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\nwas acting under Gool orders.\n  \n \n  I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\npsychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\nearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\nmine, all mine....\n  \n \n  But how could I be sure of that?\n  \n \n  Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\nskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\ntheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\nlike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\nwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\nmind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\n  \n \n  Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\nresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see again\nwhat had happened.\n  \n \n  I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\nthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\n  \n \n  Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\nfirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\nsurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\ntheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\nthrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\nmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper...."}

Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\n  \n \n  I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n  \n \n  And I had a few ideas.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence.

I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n  \n \n  \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact.

I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\n  \n \n  A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\n  \n \n  For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n  \n \n  I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\n  \n \n  I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up.

Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  ."}
{"id":"GALACTIC_GHOST_2","contents":"The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come\u2014for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas\u2014ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him."}
{"id":"GALACTIC_GHOST_3","contents":"Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care."}
{"id":"GALACTIC_GHOST_4","contents":"Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him."}
{"id":"GALACTIC_GHOST_5","contents":"He woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .

And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk.

The\nLimey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into\nhis diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age\nonly as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen\nare called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the\n   \n   Chlorella\n   \n  and\n   \n   Scenedesmus\n   \n  algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the\nroad to the larger Space without.\n  \n \n  Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in\nhistory\u2014whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis\nto the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with\ncross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire\u2014he is referred to the\nhundred-and-first chapter of\n   \n   Moby Dick\n   \n  , a book spooled in the\namusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that\nno Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more\nthan a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of\nLeyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a\nman condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Pequod's\n   \n  crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won\ntheir war on canned pork and beans. The\n   \n   Triton\n   \n  made her underwater\nperiplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and\nconcentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the\nskies, a decline set in.\n  \n \n  The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent\nfood.

And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness."}
{"id":"GOURMET_3","contents":"Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\nin space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\nextraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\nguardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\nGenerally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim\nis the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\n  \n \n  If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\nof his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\nwas the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\nso alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\ndone splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\nwas a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\nEarth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\nWilly Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\nPullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\nhemorrhoid.\n  \n \n  The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\nIt was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\nRobert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\nshipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed\n   \n   haut\ncuisine\n   \n  and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\nalgaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\nCaptain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any\nother name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\n  \n \n  Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\nof synthetic methionine\u2014an essential amino acid not synthesized by\nChlorella\u2014by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\nand thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\ntextured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\nslabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\nFor dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\nthe carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\n\"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\nin my home country:\n   \n   Mensch ist was er isst.\n   \n  It means, you are what\nyou eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this\n   \n   Schweinerei\n   \n  you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\nwith his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\nladder from the dining-cubby."}
{"id":"GOURMET_4","contents":"\"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\n  \n \n  \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\ngive his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got\nto live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\n  \n \n  \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\nsaid. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in\nmy time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\nwas green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\nis what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\nits bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\nwe'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\ndeath of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\nthe good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\nfrom Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\nwaved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about\ntomorrow's menu.\"\n  \n \n  The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\nnext day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\nwith something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\nburnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\nguess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\ndrying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\nheads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The\n   \n   pi\u00e8ce de\nr\u00e9sistance\n   \n  was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\nmass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\nfaintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\nbeen sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's\nso tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really\nsteak.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\nimploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big\nman's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\nthis pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\ncycler-salt.\""}
{"id":"GOURMET_5","contents":"\"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,\" I said. I\ngazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another\nbite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and\ngrasshoppers, to stay alive.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded.\n  \n \n  \"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised\nalgae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This\u2014the brain that guides\nthe ship\u2014cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,\nBelly-Robber?\"\n  \n \n  Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really\ndon't know what I can do to please you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban\n   \n   Hausfrau\n   \n  with the\nvapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums\nor weeping. Only\u2014can you understand this, so simple?\u2014food that will\nkeep my belly content and my brain alive.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British\nterm Dumb Insolence.\n  \n \n  Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I\nfollowed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you're driving Bailey too hard.\nYou're asking him to make bricks without straw.\"\n  \n \n  Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor,\nthat my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged\nman?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\"\nWinkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the\nPharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of\nIsrael would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the\nmother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him\nuncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,\nto improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn\nsomehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He'll crack.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we\nground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys\nmany discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\"\n  \n \n  \"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began.\n  \n \n  \"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated."}
{"id":"GOURMET_6","contents":"Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\npath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\nthe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\nby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\nmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my\ncompliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\nthe crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\ncheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\nacidly called in question again.\n  \n \n  I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\ninto Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\nbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an\n   \n   ersatz\n   \n  hot\nturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\nturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\na grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\na lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\ngenuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\nhelping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\nonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\na geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\nedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will\nhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\nstudent. That will be all, Bailey.\"\n  \n \n  The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of\nBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\nCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\non an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\nfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\nmemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\nlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\nseemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\nand he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\nCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\nthat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\nWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook."}
{"id":"GOURMET_7","contents":"Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects\nbesides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As\nhis rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this\nration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of\nbooks, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help\nhim while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a\nfact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of\nspices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,\nand a dozen others.\n  \n \n  Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards\ninterested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien\nto his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd\nexercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance\nto the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.\nTo collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come\naboard their ship mother-naked.\n  \n \n  But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects\nbaggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon\nmess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet\non the mysterious box as he sat to eat.\n  \n \n  \"What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,\nBelly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook.\n  \n \n  Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd\nhad much practice. \"I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\"\nhe said. \"I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the\ntexture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess\nshould feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the\nsteak-substrate\u2014Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special\nseasonings\u2014through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal\noil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out.\n   \n   Voila!\n   \n  I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine\nmeat.\"\n  \n \n  \"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with\nour food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of\ndistaste. \"It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I\nnever cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils\nthe meal.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of\nthe table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates.\n\"Try it,\" he urged the Captain."}
{"id":"GOURMET_8","contents":"Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The\ncolor was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell\nof fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not\ntoo bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed\nhis head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A\nkind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a\nmore reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\"\nWinkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.\n\"Aha! I have it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked.\n  \n \n  \"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and\nripped open his cardboard carton.

Sir,\" Bailey added.\n  \n \n  \"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said\nmeditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have\nsufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a\nbottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.\n  \n \n  \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat\nto the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic\nslops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of\nthis sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in\nno condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you\nunderstand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,\nslave-driving....\"\n  \n \n  \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are\ninsubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was\nscarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's\nSurgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.\n  \n \n  \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers\nand the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"\n  \n \n  \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said.\n\"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added."}
{"id":"GOURMET_9","contents":"Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him\nto my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored.

I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is\ntherapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat\nlike water and silently held out his glass for a second.

He\nreached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be\nan apt confederate of\n   \n   vis medicatrix naturae\n   \n  , the healing power of\nnature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it\noff. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.\n  \n \n  For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in\nhorribleness, a pottage or boiled\n   \n   Chlorella vulgaris\n   \n  that looked\nand tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,\nred-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as\nthough daring him to comment.

Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were\nnow strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of\nirony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was\na price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann\ntheory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain\nhad pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I\nthought.\n  \n \n  Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted\nof salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were\nvehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for\nthe decline in culinary standards.

We'll fill up and push off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you gents're\nfinished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.\"\n  \n \n  Harvey grinned puzzledly. \"We didn't take any whiskey.\"\n  \n \n  \"Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every\nchaser.\"\n  \n \n  Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That\u2014that's robbery!\" the lanky man\nmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.\n  \n \n  The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta\nmake more on each one. Besides\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty\ncrook\u2014robbing poor spacemen! You\u2014\"\n  \n \n \n \n   \"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\"\n   \n \n \n \n  Harvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the\nbartender apologetically. \"Don't mind my friend.

How much water will\nyou need?\"\n  \n \n  Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half\nrations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively.\n  \n \n  \"Let's say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the\nquantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me\nmore to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,\nthat's all.\"\n  \n \n  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with\nthem. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently\nwatched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the\nproper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and\nwetted his lips expectantly.\n  \n \n  Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to\ndo about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be\npreposterous. We simply can't afford it.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson's response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about\ncharging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.\nIt's just the purified stuff that comes so high.\"\n  \n \n  After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water\npool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed\nback to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.\n  \n \n  \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe\npicked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly,\nis the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn't something you can\nget used to in ten minutes.\"\n  \n \n  In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from\nthe igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,\naccording to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their\nbuckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more."}

The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\nin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\na faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\ninvestigate.\n  \n \n  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\nthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.\n  \n \n  \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\nto transport water in pails.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"It leads\n   \n   to\n   \n  the saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\npipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\nleads\n   \n   from\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\nscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\ninto the open\u2014before a clear, sparkling pool.\n  \n \n  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\n  \n \n  \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\n  \n \n  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\ntasting it.\n  \n \n  \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\n  \n \n  They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\nHis mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one!

Now you can meet my son, Jed.\nHim and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\n  \n \n  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\nand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\nborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\nkept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\n  \n \n  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\nhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\nhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\none.\n  \n \n  \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\natmosphere.\n  \n \n  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\nunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\n  \n \n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n  \n \n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing.

He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean,\n   \n   once\n   \n  ?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n  \n \n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n  \n \n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n  \n \n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n  \n \n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle."}

I want a taste of\nthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.\"\n  \n \n  Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The\nmayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet.

{"id":"GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_5","contents":"Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried\nthe case of medicine to the saloon.

It must have been at\nleast as good as the first; he gagged.\n  \n \n  \"That's the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted\nout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously\nbalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain\nat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,\nand asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.\"\n  \n \n  Harvey and Joe looked at each other.

Then he stood by for orders.\n  \n \n  Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were\nphenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he\ngrinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\"\n  \n \n  For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the\nculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service\nwas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played\ndeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian\n   \n   viotars\n   \n  , using his other two\nhands for waiting on the table.\n  \n \n  \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey\nwhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the\nkitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society\nhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum\nto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\"\n  \n \n  \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You're right.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,\"\ncomplained Harvey. \"I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest\nmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate\nour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\"\n  \n \n  The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.\n  \n \n  \"It's been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain't often I have\nvisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\"\n  \n \n  As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and\nHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in\na yelp of horror.\n  \n \n  \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.\u2014\"How do you arrive at this\nfantastic, idiotic figure\u2014\n   \n   three hundred and twenty-eight buckos\n   \n  !\""}
{"id":"GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_6","contents":"Johnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,\nnot a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass.

The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80\nredsents.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won't pay it!\"\n  \n \n  Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you'd act like that,\" he said\nwith regret.

Patience is the virtue that will be\nrewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\ncould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\nperson with unusual patience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\n  \n \n  Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\""}
{"id":"GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_8","contents":"Harvey turned a knob on the face of the scarred radio.

Would we not be foolish to let you discover the\nclue before purchasing the right to do so?\"\n  \n \n  The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized\nlonging. \"How much do you want?\" he asked unhappily.\n  \n \n  \"One thousand buckos, and no haggling. I am not in the mood.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson opened his mouth to argue; then, seeing Harvey's set features,\npaid with the worst possible grace.\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think we ought to tell him about the batteries, Harv?\" Joe\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"What about the batteries?\" demanded Johnson with deadly calm.\n  \n \n  \"A very small matter,\" Harvey said airily. \"You see, we have been\nanalyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course,\nthe batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not\nless than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do I do then?\"\n  \n \n  Harvey shrugged. \"Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph\nhas by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their\nkind left in the system, I ask only what they cost\u2014one hundred and\nninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his\ngun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted.\n  \n \n  Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors\ncollected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were\noutside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely\nto a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying:\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort.

Those fakers are damned fools, selling us a thing\nlike\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Joe gazed at Harvey admiringly. \"Another one sold? Harv, that spiel\npulls them in like an ether storm!\"\n  \n \n  Together with the remarkable planetoid man, they reached the ship.\nAbove them, dark, tumbling shapes blotted out the stars and silently\nmoved on. Joe opened the gangway door.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, pal,\" he said to Genius. \"We're shoving off.\"\n  \n \n  The planetoid man grinned foolishly. \"Can't go arong with you,\" he said\nwith an apologetic manner. \"I rike to, but pressure fratten me out if I\ngo.\"\n  \n \n  \"What in solar blazes are you talking about?\" Harvey asked.\n  \n \n  \"I grow up on pranetoid,\" Genius explained. \"On big pranet, too much\npressure for me.\"\n  \n \n  The two salesmen looked narrowly at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Did Johnson know that when he sold you?\" Joe snarled.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure.\" The silly grin became wider than ever. \"Peopre from Earth\nbuy me rots of times. I never reave pranetoid, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Joseph,\" Harvey said ominously, \"that slick colonist has put one over\nupon us. What is our customary procedure in that event?\"\n  \n \n  \"We tear him apart,\" Joe replied between his teeth.\n  \n \n  \"Not Mister Johnson,\" advised Genius. \"Have gun and badge. He shoot you\nfirst and then rock you up in prison.\"\n  \n \n  Harvey paused, his ominous air vanishing. \"True. There is also the\nfact, Joseph, that when he discovers the scrambled rectifier in\nthe radio we sold him, he will have been paid back in full for his\nregrettable dishonesty.\""}
{"id":"GRIFTERS'_ASTEROID_9","contents":"Unwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,\nthey entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes the\nautomatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the\nasteroid belt.\n  \n \n  \"I got kind of dizzy,\" Joe said, \"there were so many deals back and\nforth. How much did we make on the sucker?\"\n  \n \n  \"A goodly amount, I wager,\" Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and\npaper. \"Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199.

We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly\nand asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much did it cost us?\"\n  \n \n  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n  \n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Goldbricks!\n   \n  \" Harvey said succinctly.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars."}

How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby\ntalk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this\nlast communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual\nabout it?\n  \n \n  He went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as\nthey should.\n  \n \n  OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER,\nLET USNS KNOW.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape\nthoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large\ndrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout\nship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do\nanything here except rain?\"\n  \n \n  His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And\nwhy was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been\ndoing during that time?\n  \n \n  Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture\nfrom his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out\nwhen the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he\nwas stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the\njob very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle\nalone\u2014or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or\nno chance of his being able to find either here.\n  \n \n  Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and\nbrought them out where he could look at them:\n  \n \n  The mother ship,\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  , had been on the last leg of its\nplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout\nship\u2014the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the\nexploring of new worlds\u2014and set itself into a giant orbit about this\nplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means\nof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop.\nIts limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an\norbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle\na pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.\n  \n \n  Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n  \n \n  That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n  \n \n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk...."}

He pulled it out\nimpatiently and began reading.\n  \n \n  The first was from himself:\n  \n \n  YOUR SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUT\nWITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT?

All it told him was that he had been sick.\n  \n \n  He felt better now, outside of a muscular weariness, as though\nconvalescing from a long illness. He put the back of his hand to his\nforehead. Cool. No fever anyway.\n  \n \n  He glanced at the clock-calendar on the instrument board and back at\nthe date and time on the tape where he'd started his baby talk. Twenty\nhours. He hadn't been out of his head too long. He began punching the\ncommunicator keys while he nibbled at a biscuit.\n  \n \n  SEEM TO BE FULLY RECOVERED. FEELING FINE. ANYTHING NEW FROM SAM? AND\nHOW ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO SCOUT? GIVE ME ANYTHING YOU HAVE ON EITHER OR\nBOTH.\n  \n \n  SMOKY\n  \n \n  Kaiser felt suddenly weary. He lay on the scout's bunk and tried\nto sleep. Soon he was in that phantasm land between sleep and\nwakefulness\u2014he knew he was not sleeping, yet he did dream.\n  \n \n  It was the same dream he had had many times before. In it, he was back\nhome again, the home he had joined the space service to escape. He had\nrealized soon after his marriage that his wife, Helene, did not love\nhim. She had married him for the security his pay check provided. And\nthough it soon became evident that she, too, regretted her bargain,\nshe would not divorce him. Instead, she had her revenge on him by\npersistent nagging, by letting herself grow fat and querulous, and by\ncaring for their house only in a slovenly way.\n  \n \n  Her crippled brother had moved in with them the day they were married.\nHis mind was as crippled as his body and he took an unhealthy delight\nin helping his sister torment Kaiser."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_3","contents":"Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n  \n \n  After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n  \n \n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n  \n \n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n  \n \n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n  \n \n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n  \n \n \n \n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n  \n \n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n  \n \n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_4","contents":"They had stopped their play and eating as Kaiser approached and now\nmost of them swam in to shore and stood in the water, staring and\npiping. They varied in size from small seal-pups to full-grown adults.\nSome chewed on bunches of water weed, which they manipulated with their\nlips and drew into their mouths.\n  \n \n  They had mammalian characteristics, Kaiser had noted before, so it\nwas not difficult to distinguish the females from the males. The\nproportion was roughly fifty-fifty.\n  \n \n  Several of the bolder males climbed up beside Kaiser and began pawing\nhis plastic clothing. Kaiser stood still and tried to keep his\nbreathing shallow, for their odor was almost more than he could bear.\nOne native smeared Kaiser's face with an exploring paw and Kaiser\ngagged and pushed him roughly away. He was bound by regulations to\ndisplay no hostility to newly discovered natives, but he couldn't take\nmuch more of this.\n  \n \n  A young female splashed water on two young males who stood near and\nthey turned with shrill pipings and chased her into the water. The\nentire group seemed to lose interest in Kaiser and joined in the chase,\nor went back to other diversions of their own. Kaiser's inspectors\nfollowed.\n  \n \n  They were a mindless lot, Kaiser observed. The river supplied them with\nan easy existence, with food and living space, and apparently they had\nfew natural enemies.\n  \n \n  Kaiser walked away, following the long slow bend of the river, and\ncame to a collection of perhaps two hundred dwellings built in three\nhaphazard rows along the river bank. He took time to study their\nconstruction more closely this time.\n  \n \n  They were all round domes, little more than the height of a man, built\nof blocks that appeared to be mud, packed with river weed and sand. How\nthey were able to dry these to give them the necessary solidity, Kaiser\ndid not know. He had found no signs that they knew how to use fire, and\nall apparent evidence was against their having it. They then had to\nhave sunlight. Maybe it rained less during certain seasons.\n  \n \n  The domes' construction was based on a series of four arches built in a\ncircle. When the base covering the periphery had been laid, four others\nwere built on and between them, and continued in successive tiers until\nthe top was reached. Each tier thus furnished support for the next\nabove. No other framework was needed. The final tier formed the roof.\nThey made sound shelters, but Kaiser had peered into several and found\nthem dark and dank\u2014and as smelly as the natives themselves.\n  \n \n  The few loungers in the village paid little attention to Kaiser and\nhe wandered through the irregular streets until he became bored and\nreturned to the scout.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  sent little that helped during the next twelve hours\nand Kaiser occupied his time trying again to repair the damage to the\nscout.\n  \n \n  The job appeared maddeningly simply. As the scout had glided in for\na soft landing, its metal bottom had ridden a concealed rock and bent\ninward. The bent metal had carried up with it the tube supplying the\nfuel pump and flattened it against the motor casing."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_5","contents":"Opening the tube again would not have been difficult, but first it had\nto be freed from under the ship. Kaiser had tried forcing the sheet\nmetal back into place with a small crowbar\u2014the best leverage he had on\nhand\u2014but it resisted his best efforts. He still could think of no way\nto do the job, simple as it was, though he gave his concentration to it\nthe rest of the day.\n  \n \n  That evening, Kaiser received information from the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  that\nwas at least definite:\n  \n \n  SET YOURSELF FOR A SHOCK, SMOKY. SAM FINALLY CAME THROUGH. YOU WON'T\nLIKE WHAT YOU HEAR. AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT IT COULD BE WORSE.

GIVE US A FEW MORE HOURS TO WORK WITH SAM AND\nWE'LL GET YOU ALL THE PARTICULARS HE CAN GIVE US. HANG ON NOW!\n  \n \n  SOSCITES II\n  \n \n  Kaiser's reply was short and succinct:\n  \n \n  WHAT THE HELL?\n  \n \n  SMOKY\n  \n \n \n   Soscites II's\n   \n  next communication followed within twenty minutes and\nwas signed by the ship's doctor:\n  \n \n  JUST A FEW WORDS, SMOKY, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I THOUGHT I'D GET\nTHIS OFF WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM SAM. REMEMBER\nTHAT A SYMBIOTE IS NOT A PARASITE. IT WILL NOT HARM YOU, EXCEPT\nINADVERTENTLY. YOUR WELFARE IS AS ESSENTIAL TO IT AS TO YOU. ALMOST\nCERTAINLY, IF YOU DIE, IT WILL DIE WITH YOU. ANY TROUBLE YOU'VE HAD\nSO FAR WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE SYMBIOTE'S DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING\nITSELF TO ITS NEW ENVIRONMENT. IN A WAY, I ENVY YOU. MORE LATER, WHEN\nWE FINISH WITH SAM.\n  \n \n  J. G. ZARWELL\n  \n \n  Kaiser did not answer. The news was so startling, so unforeseen, that\nhis mind refused to accept the actuality. He lay on the scout's bunk\nand stared at the ceiling without conscious attention, and with very\nlittle clear thought, for several hours\u2014until the next communication\ncame in:\n  \n \n  WELL, THIS IS WHAT SAM HAS TO SAY, SMOKY.

{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_6","contents":"Kaiser could imagine that most of the crew were not too concerned about\nthe trouble he was in. He was not the gregarious type and had no close\nfriends on board. He had hoped to find the solitude he liked best in\nspace, but he had been disappointed. True, there were fewer people\nhere, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he\nwould have been more contented living in a crowded city.\n  \n \n  His naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because\nhe was more intelligent and efficient than they were.

His distress and\nanxiety were gone and he was impatient to do what he could to establish\nbetter contact with his uninvited tenant. With eager anticipation, he\nset to thinking how it could be done. After a few minutes, an idea\noccurred to him.\n  \n \n  Taking a small scalpel from a medical kit, he made a shallow cut in\nhis arm, just deep enough to bleed freely. He knew that the pain would\nsupply the necessary glandular reaction. The cut bled a few slow\ndrops\u2014and as Kaiser watched, a shiny film formed and the bleeding\nstopped.\n  \n \n  That checked pretty well with the ship's theory.\n  \n \n  Perhaps the symbiote had made his senses more acute. He tried closing\nhis eyes and fingering several objects in the room. It seemed to him\nthat he could determine the texture of each better than before, but\nthe test was inconclusive. Walking to the rear of the scout, he tried\nreading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood\nout sharp and clear!\n  \n \n  Kaiser wondered if he might not make an immediate, practical use of the\nsymbiote's apparent desire to help him. Concentrating on the discomfort\nof the high humidity and exaggerating his own displeasure with it, he\nwaited. The result surprised and pleased him.\n  \n \n  The temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture\non his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been\nhere.\n  \n \n  As a double check, he looked at the ship's thermometer. Temperature\n102, humidity 113\u2014just about the same as it had been on earlier\nreadings."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_7","contents":"During the next twenty-four hours, Kaiser and the mother ship exchanged\nmessages at regular six-hour intervals. In between, he worked at\nrepairing the damaged scout. He had no more success than before.\n  \n \n  He tired easily and lay on the cot often to rest. Each time he seemed\nto drop off to sleep immediately\u2014and awake at the exact times he\nhad decided on beforehand. At first, despite the lack of success in\nstraightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a\nsubdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the\nsymbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really\nimportant problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming\ndiscouraged.\n  \n \n  At last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He\nsent out a terse message to the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  :\n  \n \n  TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE\nINTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS\nANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL,\nBUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE? I CAN'T FIX SCOUT WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS, AND\nIF MY GUESS IS RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT TO RETURN\nIN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT.\n  \n \n  SMOKY\n  \n \n  Kaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires,\na spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed\nthat a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at\nthe native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he\nwondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant\nhorseshoe. He intended to find out.\n  \n \n  Wrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the\ndoorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on\nhis shoulders and began his journey\u2014in the opposite direction from the\nfirst native settlement.\n  \n \n  He walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise\nhad been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the\nriver, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This\ngroup was decidedly more advanced than the first!\n  \n \n  They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change\nwas mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was\nmore subdued, less repugnant.\n  \n \n  By signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to\nunderstand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and\ncalled to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The\nfirst male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a\ngesture of friendship.\n  \n \n  The weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned\npart of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it.\n  \n \n  The weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed\nthe mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him\nand waited with some trepidation for a reaction."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_8","contents":"As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the\nnative settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react\nto the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by\nhis digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at\npeace with this world.\n  \n \n  Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise\nof some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in\ncase. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the\nbeast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as\nit went.\n  \n \n  The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of\nshorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in\nthe water when he arrived and were very friendly.\n  \n \n  That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded\naround as he swam\u2014they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency\u2014and\noften nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had\ndifficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he\nneared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and\npulled him under.\n  \n \n  Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was\nclowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him\nhelpless. They sank deeper.\n  \n \n  When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of\nbubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee\nup into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the\nsurface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his\nfeet hit the river bottom.\n  \n \n  As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and\nseemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying\nto think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but\nthere was none. He shrugged helplessly.\n  \n \n  There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here\u2014if they\nhad the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for\nthem\u2014and he packed and started back to the scout.\n  \n \n  Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed\nthe relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and\nnow he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist,\nhe wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his\nbare skin were pleasant to feel.\n  \n \n  When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The\ntarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free\nit. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling\nthe equipment to the ground.\n  \n \n  Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in\nthe tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly\nhis eyes widened."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_9","contents":"Moving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment\nthrough and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator,\nas he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped\nplace on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.\n  \n \n  Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine\ncasing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried\nagain, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The\nmetal beneath yielded slightly\u2014but he felt the palms of his hands\nbruise against the lever.\n  \n \n  Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted.\nHis hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased\ntremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried\nagain. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly\u2014until the fuel pump\nhung free!\n  \n \n  Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution\nrest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its\nanticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.\n  \n \n  He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to\nread the two messages waiting for him.\n  \n \n  The first was quite routine:\n  \n \n  REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL\nWEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME\nMOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST BE\nCOMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID.\n  \n \n  TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME\nADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE\nSYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH SYMBIOTES'\nAID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE. WILL KEEP YOU\nINFORMED.\n  \n \n  GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  The second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note\nof uneasiness in it.\n  \n \n  SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT. INFORMATION\nON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had\ncovered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to\nsleep.\n  \n \n  In the morning, another message was waiting:\n  \n \n  VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS\nQUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.\n  \n \n  SS II"}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_10","contents":"Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  be\nexperiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside.

The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency\u2014there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n  \n \n  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n  \n \n  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n  \n \n  Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the\ncaptain himself:\n  \n \n  WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR\nSCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER!\n  \n \n  H.

For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip."}
{"id":"GROWING_UP_ON_BIG_MUDDY_11","contents":"The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n  \n \n  And they were almost human!\n  \n \n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n  \n \n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent.

After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n  \n \n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished.

He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n  \n \n  \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and\nlet go of everything.\"\n  \n \n  Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n  \n \n  For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?\"\n  \n \n  Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up.

{"id":"HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_2","contents":"Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain\nwere the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and\nscheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses.

Don't you know that a syndicate has built\nthe largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that\npeople are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,\nyou missed a bet!\"\n  \n \n  Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from\nScribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped\nstructure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock\nof Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular\nskyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,\nother domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the\ndrawing looked lovely and enticing.\n  \n \n  \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went\ntwo years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came\nback in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n  \n \n  Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian\nsprings had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,\nHarp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas\nthey use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of\nfloats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And\nyou can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not\nonly that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking\nbrother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an\nenzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil\ninto its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a\nfortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns\nto process the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The\nmagazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and\ncalculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he\nacknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that\nwas when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed\nentirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that\npoint?

Under the influence of the\nsoporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the\nfirst time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy\nlethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the\ninterval.\n  \n \n  It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping\nthemselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper\nwas waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of\nthe hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by\npneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n  \n \n  Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,\ngreen-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian\ncopper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a\ndozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n  \n \n  He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high\nstate of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without\nhis knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,\nhe watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in\nwheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial\nduties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n  \n \n  Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the\nexpense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and\nproneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained\noffice staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities\nof these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into\nthe field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly\nhe went over to the desk.\n  \n \n  He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy\nthat was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.\nWonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the\ndesk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a\nrobot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the\nstress of the argument.\n  \n \n  \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what\nyou charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want\none! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.\nThe clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know\nthe hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,\nreally, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.\nAdmit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he\nsmiled at the enraged woman.\n  \n \n  \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is\n   \n   too\n   \n  good.\nI might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want\nsomeone to\n   \n   hear\n   \n  what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once\nin awhile!\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone\nshe can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he\nstepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,\nplease.\" He turned back to the woman.\n  \n \n  But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil\nenough to wait your turn!\"\n  \n \n  Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,\nare always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a\nnormal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned\nauthoritatively to the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a\nrest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing\nyour\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n  \n \n  The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was\nHarper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's\nimplacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his\nforehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to\ndeposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow\nand another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the\nknees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist\nbanged the counter.\n  \n \n  The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.\nAbsently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the\nirate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n  \n \n  \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a\npallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a\nsilent and efficient robot."}

Its bank of clear\nwindows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of\nthe Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were\nbusy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and\nhis associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how\nto extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid\nand almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;\nmere details....\n  \n \n  Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up\nto the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with\nconsomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue\nsky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase\nwhile Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.\nLeaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim\ncigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily.

With a wonderful sense of\nwell-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n  \n \n  Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that\nthey were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no\nfurther opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated\nmovements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo\ninto his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him\nout.\n  \n \n  Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.\n\"There's nothing wrong with me.

You can't reason with\nthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You\ntry it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I\nhad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready\nto staff my offices with the things!\"\n  \n \n  The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and\ngroaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use\nsome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I\nate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You\nmean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\n  \n \n  Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n  \n \n  \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\n  \n \n  The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n  \n \n  The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed."}
{"id":"HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_6","contents":"There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.\nSomething that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it\nout.\n  \n \n  For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that\nmade him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,\nsince he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking\nmud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he\nwas sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he\ngagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then\nstood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and\nexercised him.\n  \n \n  Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.\nThere was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the\nphone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two\nweeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n  \n \n  \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned\nhis back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look\nflesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become\naccustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for\nhours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an\nappetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they\nsent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he\ncould wake up enough to be.\n  \n \n  He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,\nstill moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily\ninformed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.\nAfter I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't\nfind any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the\nelevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a\nman or he's stuck.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait\nany longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been\nthinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when\nthat assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled\nand gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room\nand I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what\nhappens?\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll\nget my clothes.\"\n  \n \n  Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n  \n \n  Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?\nI'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have\nto go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n  \n \n  Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe\nyou could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's\nokay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in\nthat fancy lobby.\"\n  \n \n  Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots\nwill be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm\nsure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't\nworry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n  \n \n  Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room\nhe watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for\nhis first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's\nclothing.\n  \n \n  The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's\nclothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking\nup on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was\nshoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number\ntwelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from\nhis image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.\n\"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for\nme. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n  \n \n  He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the\nrobot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to\nthe elevator."}
{"id":"HAGERTY'S_ENZYMES_7","contents":"Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge\nsuave lobby.\n  \n \n  He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the\nother visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the\nelevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island\nin a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the\noversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots\nshared his self control.\n  \n \n  The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.\nFrantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.\nWith a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving\ninexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he\nordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n  \n \n  \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he\ncircled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things\nat the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.\nEspecially, card indexes.\n  \n \n  \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get\nit straight again! Stop it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your\nswitchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n  \n \n  With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an\nelectric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became\noddly inanimate.\n  \n \n  \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the\ncollar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across\nthe width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond\nspeech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and\nreturned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at\nthe same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n  \n \n  Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper\nflapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who\nwas busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal\ndesk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good\nman\u2014\" he began.\n  \n \n  \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the\nmanager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could\nstretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper\nS. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I\nhaven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way\ndownstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?\nBecause that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those\ndamnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,\nHarper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a\nsheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n  \n \n  Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic\npattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.\nWith a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \"\n   \n   My\n   \n  robots!\" he muttered.\n\"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n  \n \n  Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you\ndon't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,\nat the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my\nresignation.\"\n  \n \n  Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool\nrobots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix\nthe two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with\nrobots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.\nWe\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.\nAnd it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.\nSo\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n  \n \n  Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he\nhooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and\nreached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I\ndon't know,\" he said mildly.\n  \n \n  Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What\ndo you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,\naren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that\nthese robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even\nmake a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a\nreasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at\nyour establishment.\"\n  \n \n  Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots\nafter what you've seen and experienced?\"\n  \n \n  Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take\ninto consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And\nthere's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm\nwilling to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n  \n \n  With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his\nhead. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll\nback you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.\nBreen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of\nthe hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny\nhand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but\nacross the lobby to the elevator.\n  \n \n  Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the\ntreatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders\ninside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready\nfor the second step of his private Operation Robot."}

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened."}
{"id":"HIS_MASTER'S_VOICE_ANALOG_SCIENCE_FACT_\u00b7_SCIENCE_FICTION_2","contents":"My sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\n  \n \n  He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then why don't they do that?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n  \n \n  \"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\n  \n \n  He ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n  \n \n  \"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\n   \n   certain\n   \n  that the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\n  \n \n \n   What's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n   \n  , I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n  \n \n  \"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't deny it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\n  \n \n  He considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n  \n \n  \"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n  \n \n  \"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\n  \n \n  I could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\n  \n \n  And, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up."}

A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n  \n \n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n   \n   average\n   \n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n  \n \n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n  \n \n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n   \n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n   \n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n  \n \n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n  \n \n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n  \n \n  The Political Survey Division\n   \n   does\n   \n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n  \n \n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n  \n \n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n   \n   was\n   \n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n  \n \n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n  \n \n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n   \n   fast\n   \n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n  \n \n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n  \n \n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with."}

As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\n  \n \n  And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\n  \n \n  With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\n  \n \n  If one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\n  \n \n  So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\n  \n \n  If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\n   \n   responsible\n   \n  human being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\n  \n \n  The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\n  \n \n  As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire."}
{"id":"HIS_MASTER'S_VOICE_ANALOG_SCIENCE_FACT_\u00b7_SCIENCE_FICTION_5","contents":"When I finally caught the beam from Ceres and set my flitterboat down\non the huge landing field that had been carved from the nickel-iron\nof the asteroid with a focused sun beam, I was itchy with my own\nperspiration and groggy tired. I don't like riding in flitterboats,\nsitting on a\n  [17]\n  bucket seat, astride the drive tube, like a witch on a\nbroomstick, with nothing but a near-invisible transite hull between me\nand the stars, all cooped up in a vac suit. Unlike driving a car, you\ncan't pull a flitterboat over and take a nap; you have to wait until\nyou hit the next beacon station.\n  \n \n  Ceres, the biggest rock in the Belt, is a lot more than just a beacon\nstation. Like Eros and a few others, it's a city in its own right. And\nexcept for the Government Reservation, Viking Spacecraft owned Ceres,\nlock, stock, and mining rights.\n  \n \n  Part of the reason for Viking's troubles was envy of that ownership.\nThere were other companies in the Belt that would like to get their\nhands on that plum, and there were those who were doing everything\nshort of cutting throats to get it. The PSD was afraid it might come to\nthat, too, before very long.\n  \n \n  Ceres is fifty-eight million cubic miles of nickel-iron, but nobody\nwould cut her up for that. Nickel-iron is almost exactly as cheap as\ndirt on Earth, and, considering shipping costs, Earth soil costs a\ngreat deal more than nickel-iron in the Belt.\n  \n \n  But, as an operations base, Ceres is second to none. Its surface\ngravity averages .0294 Standard Gee, as compared with Earth's .981,\nand that's enough to give a slight feeling of weight without unduly\nhampering the body with too much load. I weigh just under six pounds\non Ceres, and after I've been there a while, going back to Earth is a\nstrain that takes a\n  [18]\n  week to get used to. Kids that are brought up in\nthe Belt are forced to exercise in a room with a one-gee spin on it at\nleast an hour a day. They don't like it at first, but it keeps them\nfrom growing up with the strength of mice. And an adult with any sense\ntakes a spin now and then, too. Traveling in a flitterboat will give\nyou a one-gee pull, all right, but you don't get much exercise.\n  \n \n  I parked my flitterboat in the space that had been assigned to me by\nLanding Control, and went over to the nearest air-lock dome.\n  \n \n  After I'd cycled through and had shucked my vac suit, I went into the\ninner room to find Colonel Brock waiting for me.\n  \n \n  \"Have a good trip, Oak?\" he asked, trying to put a smile on his\nscarred, battered face.\n  \n \n  \"I got here alive, if that makes it a good flitterboat trip,\" I said,\nshaking his extended hand.\n  \n \n  \"That's the definition of a good trip,\" he told me.\n  \n \n  \"Then the question was superfluous. Seriously, what I need is a bath\nand some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll get that, but first let's go somewhere where we can talk. Want\na drink?\"\n  \n \n  \"I could use one, I guess. Your treat?\"\n  \n \n  \"My treat,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n  \n \n  I followed him out and down a ladder to a corridor that led north. By\ndefinition, any asteroid spins toward the east, and all directions\nfollow from that, regardless of which way the axis may point.\n  \n \n  [19]\n  \n \n  Colonel Harrington Brock was dressed in the black-and-gold \"union\nsuit\" that was the uniform of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. My own was\na tasteful green, but some of the other people in the public corridor\nseemed to go for more flashiness; besides silver and gold, there were\nshocking pinks and violent mauves, with stripes and blazes of other\ncolors.\n  \n \n  A crowd wearing skin-tight cover-alls might shock the gentle people of\nMidwich-on-the-Moor, England, but they are normal dress in the Belt.\nYou can't climb into a vac suit with bulky clothing on, and, if you\ndid, you'd hate yourself within an hour, with a curse for every wrinkle\nthat chafed your skin. And, in the Belt, you never know when you might\nhave to get into a vac suit fast. In a \"safe\" area like the tunnels\ninside Ceres, there isn't much chance of losing air, but there are\nplaces where no one but a fool would ever be more than ten seconds away\nfrom his vac suit.\n  \n \n  I read an article by a psychologist a few months back, in which he\nclaimed that the taste for loud colors in union suits was actually\ndue to modesty. He claimed that the bright patterns drew attention to\nthe colors themselves, and away from the base the colors were laid\nover. The observer, he said, tends to see the color and pattern of the\nsuit, rather than the body it clings to so closely. Maybe he's right;\nI wouldn't know, not being a psychologist. I\n   \n   have\n   \n  spent summers in\nnudist resorts, though, and I never noticed anyone painting themselves\nwith lavender\n  [20]\n  and chartreuse checks. On the other hand, the people who\ngo to nudist resorts are a self-screened group. So are the people who\ngo to the Belt, for that matter, but the type of screening is different.\n  \n \n  I'll just leave that problem in the hands of the psychologists, and go\non wearing my immodestly quiet solid-color union suits."}

He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water.

Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding.

A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square.

The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well.

They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five\nhundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....\n  \n \n  \"Hullo!\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding\nclumsily through the sand toward him. \"Cantwell's the name,\" Steve said.\n\"I'm one of you.\"\n  \n \n  Bleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \"Cantwell. Yeah, I\nremember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,\nno. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing\nhere now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\"\n  \n \n  The bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias\nWhiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a\nboy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in\nhis eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in\nhis mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was\nwell-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a\nbig muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had\nhardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve\nCantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the\nKumajis, and had grown rich\u2014by colony standards\u2014at his business. Now,\nSteve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the\nothers\u2014either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a\nnew colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.\nPerhaps that explained his bitterness.\n  \n \n  \"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\"\n  \n \n  The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.\nThey hardly seemed to be moving at all. \"Is my aunt all right?\" Steve\nsaid. She was the only family he remembered.\n  \n \n  Tobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \"I hate to be the one to tell you\nthis. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died\nfrom the poisoned water last night.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was\npity\u2014pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.\nSadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness."}

The first person Steve saw was a girl.\nShe wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face\u2014it would be a\npretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized\u2014was etched with\nlines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. \"Who is he, Dad?\" the\ngirl said.\n  \n \n  \"Young Cantwell. Remember?\"\n  \n \n  So this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten\nyears ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.\nShe was a woman now....\n  \n \n  \"Steve Cantwell?\" Mary said. \"Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I\u2014I'm\nsorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your\naunt. If there's anything I can do....\"\n  \n \n  Steve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a\nslim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time\nlike this was little short of amazing, especially since it was\ncompletely genuine.\n  \n \n  He appreciated it.\n  \n \n  Tobias Whiting said: \"Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get\nalong with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know\nthat.\" He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. \"But I\nnever got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be\npoor again. We could have been rich.\"\n  \n \n  Steve asked, \"What happened to all your profits?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll\nnever see it again.\"\n  \n \n  Mary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to\nher. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding\nand hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up\nto recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias\nWhiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of\nthem, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.\n  \n \n  But Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was\ncomforting and reassuring."}

Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\nday before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\u2014with the\nKumaji.\"\n  \n \n  None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said.\n  \n \n  \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\ncolony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\u2014not by a long sight.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\" someone asked.\n  \n \n  \"No sir. They'll trade. For our location.

He won't get far.\"\n  \n \n  \"He'll crash in the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"Crash or crash-land,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  Mary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to stop him,\" Gort said. \"And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji,\nthey'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never\nfight them off without the protection of our village.

Can't spare more\nthan a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find\nus\u2014or are led to us\u2014and attack.\"\n  \n \n  Steve said, \"I should have taken something out of the 'copter every\nnight, so it couldn't start.

Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\norder to regain his fortune.\n  \n \n  On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\nmade their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\nKumaji encampment by now.\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\" Mary said.\n  \n \n  The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand.

Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\ntheir\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\naside. \"They'd kill us,\" he said. \"We can only surrender.\"\n  \n \n  They were hobbled and led painfully across the sand.

It would\ngive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate\nloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him\nto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin\nteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable\nlectures to a bored and captive audience of one.\n  \n \n  He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether\nit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as\ndirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and\nthink more like a god than any man for generations.\n  \n \n  But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing\nbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.\n  \n \n  Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already\ntalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had\ncut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and\nwinked at it whenever he passed that way.\n  \n \n  Lately she was winking back at him.\n  \n \n  Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from\nhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.\n  \n \n  No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet\ncould only be this lonely on Mars.\n  \n \n  Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.\n  \n \n  All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle\nof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,\nflat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the\nblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons\nand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole\ngimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was\nneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.\n  \n \n  The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't\ntake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully\nspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb\nMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.\n  \n \n  They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people\nfor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to\nisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet\nand his fellows.\n  \n \n  The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare\nto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter\nservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations\nfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't\nproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between\nthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.\n  \n \n  But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered\nwonderful opportunities.\n  \n \n  It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making\na tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as\nbright as envy."}

I\nthought of being on productive status again. I had almost lost my\nfanatical craving to be useful to the State, but I did want to be\nbusy\u2014desperately. I didn't want to be despised any more. I didn't\nwant to be lonely. I wanted to reproduce myself.\n  \n \n  I made my decision suddenly. Waves of emotion carried me along. I got\nup, crossed the room to the directory, and pushbuttoned to find the\nlocation of the nearest Govpub office.\n  \n \n  I didn't know what would happen and almost didn't care.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Like most important places, the Govpub Office in Center Four was\nunderground. I could have taken a tunnelcar more quickly, but it seemed\npleasanter to travel topside. Or maybe I just wanted to put this off a\nbit. Think about it. Compose myself.\n  \n \n  At the entrance to the Govpub warren there was a big director cyb, a\nplate with a speaker and switch. The sign on it said to switch it on\nand get close to the speaker and I did.\n  \n \n  The cyb's mechanical voice\u2014they never seem to get the \"th\" sounds\nright\u2014said, \"This is Branch Four of the Office of Government\nPublications. Say, 'Publications,' and\/or, 'Information desired,' as\nthoroughly and concisely as possible. Use approved voice and standard\nphraseology.\"\n  \n \n  Well, simple enough so far. I had always rather prided myself on my\nknack for approved voice, those flat, emotionless tones that indicate\nefficiency. And I would never forget how to speak Statese. I said,\n\"Applicant desires all pertinent information relative assignment,\nchange or amendment of State Serial designations, otherwise generally\nreferred to as nomenclature.\"\n  \n \n  There was a second's delay while the audio patterns tripped relays and\nbrought the memory tubes in.\n  \n \n  Then the cyb said, \"Proceed to Numbering and Identity section. Consult\nalphabetical list and diagram on your left for location of same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" I said absent-mindedly.\n  \n \n  I started to turn away and the cyb said, \"Information on tanks is\nmilitary information and classified. State authorization for\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I switched it off."}

There\nwas an information desk in the center of the room.\n  \n \n  I looked that way and my heart went into free fall.\n  \n \n  There was a girl at the information desk. An exceptionally attractive\ngirl. She was well within the limits of acceptable standard, and her\nfeatures were even enough, and her hair a middle blonde\u2014but she had\nsomething else. Hard to describe. It was a warmth, a buoyancy, a sense\nof life and intense animation. It didn't exactly show; it radiated. It\nseemed to sing out from her clear complexion, from her figure, which\neven a tunic could not hide, from everything about her.\n  \n \n  And if I were to state my business, I would have to tell her my name.\n  \n \n  I almost backed out right then.

It had to be done.\n  \n \n  I walked up to the desk and the girl turned to face me, and I could\nhave sworn that a faint smile crossed her lips. It was swift, like the\nshadow of a bird across one of the lawns in one of the great parks\ntopside. Very non-standard. Yet I wasn't offended; if anything, I felt\nsuddenly and disturbingly pleased.\n  \n \n  \"What information is desired?\" she asked. Her voice was standard\u2014or\nwas it?\n  \n \n  Again I had the feeling of restrained warmth.\n  \n \n  I used colloquial. \"I want to get the dope on State Serial\ndesignations, how they're assigned and so forth.

I wanted to look away, but I\ncouldn't find a decent excuse to. I saw her eyes become wide and\nnoticed for the first time that they were a warm gray, almost a mouse\ncolor. I felt like laughing at that irrelevant observation, but more\nthan that I felt like turning and running. I felt like climbing and\ndashing all over the walls like a frustrated cat and yelling at the\ntop of my lungs. I felt like anything but standing there and looking\nstupid, meeting her stare\u2014"}

They were burly and had\nthat hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric\nclubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides.\n  \n \n  I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not.

Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing\ntime. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the\nfollowing morning.\n  \n \n  In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at\ntheoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping\naround. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and\ngot up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a\ndrama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to\nthe forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem\npolitical prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of\nMars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led\nby our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker\nthan water. Standard.\n  \n \n  There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless\nforests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in\na green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up\nwith the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet.\n  \n \n  And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for\nthe nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere\nin the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere\nbeyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go\nthere....\n  \n \n  Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a\nverse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had\nunwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.) The\npoem went:\n  \n Wherever I go,\n  \n  I\n  \n go too,\n And spoil everything.\n  \n  That was it. The story of mankind.\n  \n \n  I turned the glowlight down and lay on the pneumo after a while, but I\ndidn't sleep for a long, long time.\n  \n \n  Then, when I did sleep, when I had been sleeping, I heard the voice\nagain. The low, seductive woman's voice\u2014the startling, shocking voice\nout of my unconscious.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You have taken the first step\n   \n  ,\" she said. \"\n   \n   You are on your way\nto freedom.

And Close the Door,\ntoo.\"\n  \n \n  Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in\nfront of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate\nme from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.\nWhen I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the\nmanuscript, I groped under the chair for it.

Every round normal, nothing\nunusual about the hands\u2014three of a kind, a low straight, that sort\nof thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be\n   \n   my\n   \n  deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king\u2014every time! And each time,\nsomebody else has four aces....\"\n  \n \n  He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There\nwas one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top\nbroke and glass chips got into the bottle.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have to go down for more soda,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"I'll come, too. I need air.\"\n  \n \n  At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in\nwhat must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the\ntop of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the\ntile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from\nat least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and\nI was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth\nopen and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his\nmouth open.\n  \n \n \n \n  On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie\nhis shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi\nswerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded,\nits rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign\ncars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any\nside-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to\nrest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that\nmoment.\n  \n \n  The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and\nthe taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged\ncrosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either\nforward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi\nto a lamp.\n  \n \n  Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at\nall, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues.\nEveryone was honking his horn.\n  \n \n  Danny was furious\u2014more so when he tried to put through a call to his\nstation house from the box opposite.\n  \n \n  It was out of order."}
{"id":"I_am_a_Nucleus_5","contents":"Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the\nwindows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had\nbrightened up considerably.\n  \n \n  \"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said.\n\"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned\nand nodded toward the pandemonium.\n  \n \n  When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk\nlamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except\none. That was tied in three knots.\n  \n \n  All\n   \n   right\n   \n  , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had\ncome for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call\nMcGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university\nuptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he\nknows everything.\n  \n \n  When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,\n   \n   more\n   \n  trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's\nvoice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were\nconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for\nyou to work on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\"\n  \n \n  \"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\n  \n \n  While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of\nmy novel\u2014perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a\npoint where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it\nwas too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\n\"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to\nthe side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\n  \n \n  This was absolutely not my day."}
{"id":"I_am_a_Nucleus_6","contents":"\"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you've told me is impossible or\nsupernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against\nthat poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him.\nIt's all those other things....\"\n  \n \n  He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight\nwhile I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\n  \n \n  \"Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at\nwhat I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely,\nand the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that\nyou're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.\" I started\nto get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don't\nyou see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook\nhis head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a\ndemonstration.\"\n  \n \n  He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any\nchange on you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There\nmust have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think\nthey'll each have the same date, perhaps?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you accumulate all that change today?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. During the week.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you\ncould have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that\nwould be\n   \n   actually\n   \n  impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll\ntell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if\nthey all come up heads.\"\n  \n \n  I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the\nfloor. They clattered and bounced\u2014and bounced together\u2014and stacked\nthemselves into a neat pile.\n  \n \n  I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a\nhandful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\n  \n \n  These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,\nthe adjacent ones touching.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\n  \n \n  \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that\nthere are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\nUniverse\u2014random and design. The sands on the beach are an example\nof random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions\nof the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so\nmany of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of\nThermodynamics\u2014quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;\nit's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other\nhand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes\nagainst it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental\nmanifestation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is\ncontrolling the coins and\u2014the other things?\""}
{"id":"I_am_a_Nucleus_7","contents":"He shook his head. \"No. All I mean is that improbable things usually\nhave improbable explanations.

But why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an\nelectrical storm. Something has it in for me!\"\n  \n \n  McGill grinned. \"Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be\nanthropomorphic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life.\"\n  \n \n  \"On what basis?

Only eggs and coffee.\"\n  \n \n  We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we\ncould hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were,\nby this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we\nheard one of them say to Danny, \"I don't know what the hell's going\non around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it.\nThey can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen\nanything like it.\"\n  \n \n  Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they\ntried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let\nthe other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had\nembarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were\nreplaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.\n  \n \n  \"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,\nonly to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches\nwhich met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts\never witnessed\u2014a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything\nelse, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical\nexcuses and threats."}
{"id":"I_am_a_Nucleus_8","contents":"Danny appeared at that moment.

Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the\nladies seemed not to be.\n  \n \n  \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my\numbrella and we'll say no more about it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\n  \n \n  The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also\ncaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the\nother two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,\nbut the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was\nMolly. My nurse-wife.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all\nright?\" Was\n   \n   I\n   \n  all right!\n  \n \n  \"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to\nthink.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I'm all right. But why....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's\nnumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced\nand it came from our phone here.

It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast\nto it.\n  \n \n  \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\n  \n \n  When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\n\"And incidentally to me.

{"id":"I_am_a_Nucleus_9","contents":"Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you\n   \n   feel\n   \n  all right, darling?\" she asked me.

For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't\nmagnetic\u2014and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,\nand a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has\nmainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,\nall you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of\niron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay\nthere, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than\nthat\u2014they go on moving.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it\nhas a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree\nthis\u2014thing\u2014has no discernible shape and motion\n   \n   is\n   \n  involved, but\nplants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but\nit does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a\nnon-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and\nit has a nucleus and it seems to be growing\u2014at least in what you might\ncall improbability.\"\n  \n \n  Molly frowned. \"Then what\n   \n   is\n   \n  it? What's it made of?\"\n  \n \n  \"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about\nthe atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to\nbe forming around a nucleus not of its own material\u2014the way a speck\nof sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of\ncrystallization.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an\nimpertinent look.\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn't have the same\ndate? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because I don't think this thing got going before today and\neverything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions\nhere and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would\nrequire retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book.\nThat telephone now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone\nrepairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.\n  \n \n  \"I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister,\" he said with strong\ndisapproval.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly not,\" I said. \"Is it broken?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not exactly\n   \n   broken\n   \n  , but\u2014\" He shook his head and took it apart some\nmore."}

The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than\nbefore and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,\nand when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the\nlieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.\n  \n \n  \"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it's at the\nstation house. What there's left of it, that is.\"\n  \n \n  Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt\nthe speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of\ncigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I\nhappened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before\nI could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the\nsidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but\nsaid nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.\n  \n \n  When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool\u2014although it\ndidn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door\nand ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the\nnext table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green\nevening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter\nreturned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold\ncuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait\nfor the fat lady.\n  \n \n  I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used\ninstead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and\nmade faces."}

Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\nbuzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\n  \n \n  When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\nwhat about that control?\"\n  \n \n  \"What control?\"\n  \n \n  \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, that little thing.\"\n  \n \n  Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly\nsharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\nLemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\nagain probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing\ngracefully.\n  \n \n  \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\nsnapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\nBurner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's,\nwould be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now.\nNot that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\nOh, very quite!\n  \n \n  \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you\nto shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig\non tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\nshe'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway\nabout your fusion control!\"\n  \n \n  \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\nbeen thinking.\"\n  \n \n  \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\nmyself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Venus dames,\" O'Rielly said dreamily, \"don't boss anything, do they?\"\n  \n \n  Callahan yelped like he'd been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\n\"O'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\nCallahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\nposition; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\nhave overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the\ndevil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O'Rielly, open your big ears\nwhilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\n  \n \n  \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\ngot one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\neverybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\nit. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\nthe shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\nfamily\u2014everything.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\nwith knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus\ndames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\npick up with a blotter.

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look!

The dear little stowaway\nwas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\nlovely neck and his own forever.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not\nopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\nhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\""}

Awp, you angel-faced\npirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\nyou don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\ndon't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\na zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\nO'Rielly's shower.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\nTrillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\nspiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\nthe doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\nand coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\n  \n \n  \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\nTrillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\n  \n \n  Trillium\u2014with her shape\u2014passing as a boy hustling bags through this\nship.

No,\ndon't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\n  \n \n  \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\nto know.\n  \n \n  The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a\nday over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\nprobably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\nFrosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\nlooked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\n  \n \n  Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\n  \n \n  Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\nerect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\nrobed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\nlesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\nfrom his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\nof two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\n  \n \n  She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\nyou a question, did I not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\nanswer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was\ndiscussing\u2014ah\u2014matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly\nhere is considering it, ma'am.\"\n  \n \n  Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\nideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life.\nYes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to\nfreeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\ndown here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\"\nCallahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense\u2014I mean,\nwomen\u2014merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\nthe control phenomenon, ma'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\nBurnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\nsaid with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't\nbother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world!\nPresent company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\ncourtly bow.\n  \n \n  \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face,\nthen in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\nshe muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\nhorrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\nagain. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for?\nThen use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\nburner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\nme, Your Excellency?\"\n  \n \n  \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as\nhe might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\never told any Venus man what to do.\n  \n \n  The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\nsteps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\nblowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\ndoor, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\nof person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\nExcellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\nsweat.\n  \n \n  Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\nfirst, Your Excellency.\"\n  \n \n  \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\n\"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\n  \n \n  No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\nWoman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge\nonto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more\nsatisfactory.\"\n  \n \n  \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\""}

He felt the way Callahan\nlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness and\nprotect it to his last breath of life.\n  \n \n  Old Woman led the way to her office.

Glaser knew that he had\nextraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. He\ntold the machine so heatedly.\n  \n \n  The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, that\nGlaser did\n   \n   not\n   \n  have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinary\nperception to an extraordinary degree. There is a\n   \n   difference\n   \n  , the\nmachine insisted.\n  \n \n  It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but built\nothers more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the owners\nof Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.\n  \n \n  And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (or\nEppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read\n   \n   Positive\n   \n  on a\nnumber of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could not\neven read music. But it had also read\n   \n   Positive\n   \n  on ninety per cent of\nthe acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been a\nsound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Mi\nit had read\n   \n   Positive\n   \n  on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out of\nbillions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at all\nwas shown by the test.\n  \n \n  So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the area\nand got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently one\nindividual, though this could not be certain) and got very definite\naction. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, and\nassumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.\n  \n \n  Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it ever\nproduces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrug\nof the shoulders in a man. They called it the \"You tell\n   \n   me\n   \n  light.\"\n  \n \n  So among the intelligences there was at least one that might be\nextraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to be\nforewarned."}

Life was bleak enough on the deserts,\nwithout being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend\nwho was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a\nfew spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge\nto work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But\nmore, he would have been among people he understood.\n  \n \n  The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to\nexist only in organized masses.

He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n  \n \n  He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the\ncongregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few\npasses he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.\nBut when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a\ncustomary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed\nchips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple\ncourtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the\nfeel. He got a seven.

He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid. Not that he looked his age\u2014he was big and blond, like Danny and\nTim and me, and could have passed for our older brother.\n  \n \n  \"Boys, boys!\" he reproved us. \"Danny, you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself\u2014picking on poor Kev.\"\n  \n \n  Even if it hadn't been Danny's fault, he would still have been blamed.\n  \n \n  Nobody was ever supposed to raise a voice or a hand or a thought to\npoor afflicted Kev, because nature had picked on me enough. And the\nnicer everybody was to me, the nastier I became, since only when they\nlost their tempers could I get\u2014or so I believed\u2014their true attitude\ntoward me.\n  \n \n  How else could I tell?\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, fella,\" Dan apologized to me. The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n  \n \n  \"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n  \n \n  \"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\n  \n \n  I was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either."}

The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\n  \n \n  Only I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n  \n \n  \"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\n  \n \n  And that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and\/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\n  \n \n  So I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\n  \n \n  I thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\n  \n \n  About all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  I didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule.

In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\n  \n \n  I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\n  \n \n  For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative.

A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\n  \n \n  However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us."}

I was a little afraid of\nSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, she\ngot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, and\nshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerable\na position herself.\n  \n \n  However, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck near\nour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they started\ncarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned into\na hospital for the duration.

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship.

{"id":"Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_2","contents":"And she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  launching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\n  \n \n  Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  , the\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\n  \n \n  All three were miserable failures.\n  \n \n  The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  exploded. The\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  vanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\n  \n \n  The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\n  \n \n  Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\n  \n \n  Cob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\n  \n \n  Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\n  \n \n  Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n  \n \n  \"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\n  \n \n  Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the\n   \n   Antigone\n   \n  , and I expect him by\n600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See\nto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start\nloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E\/O to be?\"\n  \n \n  Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\"\n  \n \n  Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V.\nHendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\""}

Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid.

But nerve\nhas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\nand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\nClay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\nappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't\nknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\nsent him.\"\n  \n \n  The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\nbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\nand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\nlarge for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\nsightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\nhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n  \n \n  He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\nthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\nmore ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\nordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n  \n \n  There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\nnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\nthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\nThey jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\nas they should have been for a plant this size.\n  \n \n  Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\nwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\nchanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\nstreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to\nhandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\nstairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\nemployees' entrance was on the third side.\n  \n \n  It wasn't."}
{"id":"LEX_2","contents":"Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\nhe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\nset to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\nopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\na soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.\nManners?\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   are\n   \n  Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n  \n \n  He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\nmicrophone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down\nthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\nfor him.\n  \n \n  He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\ngrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\nbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\nhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n  \n \n  \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n  \n \n  Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\njust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\nall the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\ninterview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to\nunnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n  \n \n  He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\nstraightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\nfor a position should.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n  \n \n  He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\nfront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\nHe did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n  \n \n  The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\na high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\nmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\npaintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\nflowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\ninto Hollywood's idea of an office.\n  \n \n  His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\nfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of\nframe supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and\ndrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n  \n \n  But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\nto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\ncomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\nthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n  \n \n  \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly."}
{"id":"LEX_3","contents":"Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\njolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\nreply that would cost him this job.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\nhave any knowledge of medicine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n  \n \n  \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\nthings like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the\n   \n   basics\n   \n  of how\nwe live.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions\nthey're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\nout of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After\nI got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\nan electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\ncompany\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n  \n \n  Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\nwith money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\ntheir products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\ncalculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\naren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter\nadmitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\ncalculus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\nengineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\nbe useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\ngetting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\nthese birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\nget a job with someone else?\"\n  \n \n  Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\nsent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\nseen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been\neasy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\nprocedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\nyou'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\nscared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\nsomething you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\nout of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\nany wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\ndegree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\""}
{"id":"LEX_4","contents":"It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\nthis straight all the way. He nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n  \n \n  \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\nbasis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n  \n \n  Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\nbeen, yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?\nSo youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a\nhighly paid minority.

And the\nstockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\nhell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have\nto, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\nsolution?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n  \n \n  Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\nWhat makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n  \n \n  \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\nschool.

He nodded with inexpressible\ntiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\nbe made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\nillusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\ncynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\nor cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\nThose were the important things. The background data I got from the\nAssociation on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\nI think you are. Am I right?\"\n  \n \n  \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if\nthat answers the question.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n  \n \n  In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\nat sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\nthe lack of employees' entrances.\n  \n \n  \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic\ndoors. Anything else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n  \n \n  Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\nthey all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\nproducts or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\nwater-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\ngoods.\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show\nyou.\""}
{"id":"LEX_5","contents":"The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\nantiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\nthe manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\ndisorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\noverhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\nof their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\nof illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\nreached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\nloading door he had seen from outside.\n  \n \n  Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\nwith raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set\nof automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\nexactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\nmaterials handling machines.\"\n  \n \n  Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\nmachines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\nformation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n  \n \n  They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\ntwo arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\nfashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\nrelaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n  \n \n  Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,\nthese machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\nplant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\na single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\nthe toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\nuseful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\nof the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\ntugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\nand before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\nto attend to mysterious duties of their own.\n  \n \n \n \n  Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\nfrustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\nreplaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\na large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\nother materials were stored.\n  \n \n  \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\nshortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the\ntrace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,\nit's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\nplant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\nmaterials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\npackage the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\nsent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\nsent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\nthe withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\npurchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\nyou through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\nthey're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\""}
{"id":"LEX_6","contents":"Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\neach one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\nor carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\nsomething to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\neverywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\nexact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\ndoing it.\n  \n \n  He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\naisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\nonrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\nspeeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\nthat was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\nexit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\nwhere they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\ngo by.\n  \n \n  Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\nroom where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard\nbusiness machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\nthat room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\ntypewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\nkeyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\nthis one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\nthere's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\nbookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"\nasked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\nhad engulfed him.\n  \n \n  \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\nevery week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n  \n \n  The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\nwhen they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\nlooked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\nsagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\nsilence remain unbroken.\n  \n \n  Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run\narticles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\nidiotic notions about specialization.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\nApparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\nalthough it hadn't been strenuous."}
{"id":"LEX_7","contents":"He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\nin contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\narrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n  \n \n  \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\nbusiness twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\nthrough university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\ngot so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\nThey bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\ndetermined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\nabsorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\ntheory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\ntried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\none of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\nway I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\nspoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\nbecause I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\nAfter three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\nsuppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\na strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\nwife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\nwas killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\nmade me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\nmade things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\nto spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I\nremember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\ngirl.\n  \n \n  \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\nemployees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\ndesign the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\nmyself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\nwasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\nplant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\nbusiness I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\nmulti-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\nordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\nyou, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\nand from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\nknowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\nbut I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\ncompare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\nof course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\ndrums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\nEverest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\nwork for me.\n  \n \n  \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\npredetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\nin units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\nthe logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\nway they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\nelectrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\nand once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n  \n \n  \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\ncompete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\ndo only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\nthe back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\nwould be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\nme free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\nnumbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\nmoney.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked."}
{"id":"LEX_8","contents":"Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\nthis plant.

I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\nimpossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\ncontrol section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\na comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\nnevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\nfigured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\nthey could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\naction with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n  \n \n  \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\nwould be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\nactivity that I'd already established.\"\n  \n \n  Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\nand did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\nthen I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\nsort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\nwas still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\nprime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\nonly be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\nTV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\nevery order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n  \n \n  \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\npressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\nlogic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\nbutton. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\ngoing well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\nor maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\nof time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\nPretty soon the machine got the idea.\n  \n \n  \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\nof the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\ntried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\nat first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\ndiscover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\norder was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\nconvincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\nexplanation.\n  \n \n  \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\ncopied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\nconsole keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\nof the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\nkeyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\nkicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n  \n \n  \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure\ncenter in an animal's brain, isn't it?\""}
{"id":"LEX_9","contents":"When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n  \n \n  \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n  \n \n  \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n  \n \n  At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n  \n \n  A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n  \n \n  Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent."}
{"id":"LEX_10","contents":"Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\nhe continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault.

It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n  \n \n  Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle.

That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order.

And in\nspace-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n \n \n  The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\never been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\nTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\non that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\nKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\nwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\nsettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\nFaster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\nefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, in\nthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\nPlanets.\n  \n \n  An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n  \n \n  Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\nwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\nisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\nmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\nno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\nunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\nprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\nsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\nmagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\nto the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n  \n \n  He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\nthat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\neven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\nall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\nhave been better than nothing.\n  \n \n  In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\nwould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\nKorvin was all alone.\n  \n \n  True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\nlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\nout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\ndiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\nnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\nat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\nimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n  \n \n  He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\nfull stock of food concentrates.\n  \n \n  But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\nanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n  \n \n  As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\nup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n  \n \n  He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if you\ndon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\nbe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\nknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\nbut none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\nreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\nKorvin,\" he said.\n  \n \n  It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\nreplied. The green being nodded.\n  \n \n  \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\nslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closing\nthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\nquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\nhis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\ntranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\nsmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\nthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparently\nthere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightly\nawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\nmost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\nacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\ndealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\ncarefully constructed than even those marvels.\n  \n \n  \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\ndoor-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\nconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\nthan solitude.\n  \n \n  \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\napproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\nto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\nsecond.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n  \n \n  Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\nas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\npointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come\nto you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\nand Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\nfrom, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\nreference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\nto go to him. Such is his command.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\ncommand of the Ruler,\" he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\ncommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\ntry.\n  \n \n  But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\ncommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat from\nthe rest of the galaxy forever.\n  \n \n  That, after all, was his job."}
{"id":"LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_2","contents":"The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\nwalls were dark-brown, the furnishings\u2014a single great chair, several\nkneeling-benches and a small table near the chair\u2014were light-brown,\nof some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\nKorvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\ncontrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n  \n \n  The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\nbroad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\ntable near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\neither side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\nsix and a half feet high.\n  \n \n  Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\nHe wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\nThe Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex\u2014if\nany\u2014and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n  \n \n  Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\nam,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n  \n \n  \"Within what limits?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\nunder four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\ndidn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\nwere at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\nwent on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\nusually less than that\u2014approximately nine or ten inches. We call\nthese\n   \n   children\n   \n  ,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n  \n \n  \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\nsaid. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\nsaid apologetically.\n  \n \n  \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\nfor you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\npaused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\nwent on. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\nprove that beyond any doubt.\"\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\nhave tests for such matters?\"\n  \n \n  \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\nmachine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\nIt will be attached to you.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\ntechnicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\ndials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\nstraps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector\u2014and Korvin felt\nhimself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\nmatch their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\nhypnop\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\nwonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\nnecessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\nThe Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\naddition to the Comity of Nations.\n  \n \n  Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\nKorvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n  \n \n  He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\nhim telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\njob\u2014not to mention the strongest personal inclinations\u2014demanded most\nstrongly that he stay alive.\n  \n \n  He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\nseat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\nelastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\nscrews, he made no resistance.\n  \n \n  \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n  \n \n  \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Are you a\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  ?\" the Ruler asked. A\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  was a small native\npet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\nbeetle.\n  \n \n  \"I am not,\" he said."}

The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it.

Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused.

Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END"}

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept."}
{"id":"MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_2","contents":"The room was large, as rooms went nowadays\u2014thirty by twenty, with deck\nupon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a\nbank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek\nhad piled up an impressive collection of data.\n  \n \n  While he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts\npoured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help\u2014oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician\nsaid. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless\nand without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything\nI can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\"\n  \n \n  Walton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically\nbacked out of his presence.\n  \n \n \n   No doubt I must radiate charisma\n   \n  , he thought. Within the building he\nwore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the\ncrowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to\nhimself.\n  \n \n  Frowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip,\nwasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior.\n  \n \n  A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic\ncircuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson\ntubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a\nyellow-brown card dropped out of the slot:\n  \n \n \n   3216847AB1\n   \n \n \n \n   PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital, New\nYork. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard. Wgt. at\nbirth 5lb. 3oz.\n   \n \n \n  An elaborate description of the boy in great detail followed, ending\nwith blood type, agglutinating characteristic, and gene-pattern,\ncodified. Walton skipped impatiently through that and came to the\nnotification typed in curt, impersonal green capital letters at the\nbottom of the card:\n  \n \n \n   EXAMINED AT N Y EUTH CLINIC 10 JUNE 2332\n   \n \n \n   EUTHANASIA RECOMMENDED\n   \n \n \n  He glanced at his watch: the time was 1026. The boy was probably still\nsomewhere in the clinic lab, waiting for the figurative axe to descend.\n  \n \n  Walton had set up the schedule himself: the gas chamber delivered\nHappysleep each day at 1100 and 1500. He had about half an hour to save\nPhilip Prior.\n  \n \n  He peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slipped\nthe baby's card into his breast pocket.\n  \n \n  That done, he typed out a requisition for explanation of the\ngene-sorting code the clinic used. Symbols began pouring forth,\nand Walton puzzledly correlated them with the line of gibberish on\nPhillip Prior's record card. Finally he found the one he wanted:\n   \n   3f2,\ntubercular-prone\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to the\nmachine.\n   \n   Revision of card number 3216847AB1 follows. Please alter in\nall circuits.\n   \n \n \n  He proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol\n   \n   3f2\n   \n  and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version.\nThe machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. So far, so good.\n  \n \n  Then, he requested the boy's file all over again. After the customary\npause, a card numbered 3216847AB1 dropped out of the slot. He read it.\n  \n \n  The deletions had been made. As far as the machine was concerned,\nPhilip Prior was a normal, healthy baby.\n  \n \n  He glanced at his watch. 1037. Still twenty-three minutes before this\nmorning's haul of unfortunates was put away.\n  \n \n  Now came the real test: could he pry the baby away from the doctors\nwithout attracting too much attention to himself in the process?"}
{"id":"MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_3","contents":"Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n  \n \n  The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n  \n \n  Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n  \n \n  \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n  \n \n  \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n  \n \n  Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n  \n \n  \"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n  \n \n  Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n  \n \n  Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n  \n \n  He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n  \n \n  Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mistake?\n   \n  But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\"\n   \n   How glibly I reel this stuff off\n   \n  , Walton thought in amazement.\n  \n \n  Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n  \n \n  Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n  \n \n  Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said:\n   \n   Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles.\n   \n \n \n  Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put him on.\"\n  \n \n  The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess\u2014I mean\u2014well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say a word about this to\n   \n   anyone\n   \n  , not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n  \n \n  The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law\u2014the Equalization\nLaw\u2014Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n  \n \n  He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position\u2014his life,\neven\u2014for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n  \n \n  Well, the thing was done.\n  \n \n  No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n  \n \n  Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n  \n \n  His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n  \n \n  Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n  \n \n  Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Official business!\"\n  \n \n  \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious\u2014unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n  \n \n  \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh,\nRoy?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much do you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system,\nwould you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of\nthis, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton\ndoesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble\u2014oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly.\n  \n \n  \"You got me this job. You can take it away. Let's call it even for now,\nshall we?\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything you like,\" Walton said. He was drenched in sweat, though\nthe ingenious executive filter in the sending apparatus of the screen\ncloaked that fact and presented him as neat and fresh. \"I have some\nwork to do now.\" His voice was barely audible.\n  \n \n  \"I won't keep you any longer, then,\" Fred said.\n  \n \n  The screen went dead.\n  \n \n  Walton killed the contact at his end, got up, walked to the window. He\nnudged the opaquer control and the frosty white haze over the glass\ncleared away, revealing the fantastic beehive of the city outside.\n  \n \n \n   Idiot!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   Fool!\n   \n \n \n  He had risked everything to save one baby, one child probably doomed\nto an early death anyway. And FitzMaugham knew\u2014the old man could see\nthrough Walton with ease\u2014and Fred knew, too. His brother, and his\nfather-substitute.\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham might well choose to conceal Roy's defection this time,\nbut would surely place less trust in him in the future. And as for\nFred....\n  \n \n  There was no telling what Fred might do. They had never been\nparticularly close as brothers; they had lived with their parents (now\nalmost totally forgotten) until Roy was nine and Fred seven. Their\nparents had gone down off Maracaibo in a jet crash; Roy and Fred had\nbeen sent to the public cr\u00e8che.\n  \n \n  After that it had been separate paths for the brothers. For Roy, an\neducation in the law, a short spell as Senator FitzMaugham's private\nsecretary, followed last month by his sudden elevation to assistant\nadministrator of the newly-created Popeek Bureau. For Fred, medicine,\nunsuccessful private practice, finally a job in the Happysleep section\nof Popeek, thanks to Roy."}

An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\n  \n \n  Magnan gulped audibly.

We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by no means.

He won't let you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if\nhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other\nCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is\ndefinitely on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could\nname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal\nhere....\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief\nand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT\nSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,\nflying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the\nwhite ensign might be?\"\n  \n \n  Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\""}

Pallid and\nquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;\nmachines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see\nanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\n  \n \n  He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back\nfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,\nwho just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a\ndecent burial.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice\nfrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,\nninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight\nsurgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded\ndeep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n  \n \n  Rice said:\n  \n \n  \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day\ndrunk!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them\ninto a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and\nshoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one\nanother in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,\nsalvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n  \n \n  Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n  \n \n  Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\n  \n \n  This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n  \n \n  \"Sam!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative\nlab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator\nshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n  \n \n  \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it."}

{"id":"Morgue_Ship_3","contents":"\"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.\nRed and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy\nofficial. \"Take a look at this!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong\nwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it\nwas.\n  \n \n  Maybe it was because the body looked a little\n   \n   too\n   \n  dead.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,\nstood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as\ndelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly\nblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed\nclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a\ncluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed\ncompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n  \n \n  Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and\nblack. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n  \n \n  Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n  \n \n  \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n  \n \n  Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That\nright?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in\nspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.\nWhat the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone\nelse.\n  \n \n  Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!\nKriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That\nmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n  \n \n  Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.\n\"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the\nVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the\nday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick\nof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling\nthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good\ngreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n  \n \n  \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution\nis taken to protect that one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n  \n \n  \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a\nbattle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll radio for help?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred\nthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has\nswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n  \n \n  Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw\nhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His\nfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,\n\"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's\nbarrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and\ndays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads\nbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who\nstart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.\nHe stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,\nhearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own\nheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n  \n \n  \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't\ncare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?\nLethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine\nbeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n  \n \n  Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n  \n \n  Lethla was alive.\n  \n \n  He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.\nHe didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the\nnecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what\nlanguage it would use if it had to.\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he\nknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a\npale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it\nlike a dead cold star.\n  \n \n  Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From\nthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,\nbiting lines into his sharp face.\n  \n \n  Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.\n\"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n  \n \n  A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.\n   \n   You\nnever catch up with the war!\n   \n \n \n  But what if the war catches up with you?\n  \n \n  What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?"}
{"id":"Morgue_Ship_4","contents":"Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the\nchugging of blood-pumps below.

He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been\ninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n  \n \n  He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it,\nEarthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n  \n \n  Lethla nodded.

He swore at the Venusian and\nthe Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and\nquick.\n  \n \n  Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came\naboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n  \n \n  Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's\nyour radio?\"\n  \n \n  \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n  \n \n  \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.\n\"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations.

When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by\nthe new bitterness in it.\n  \n \n  Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n  \n \n  He smiled. \"That's better. Now.

He's still alive, heading toward Venus\nat an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these\nair-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours.

Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.\nRice grumbled and cursed after him.\n  \n \n  On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like\na white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never\nknew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number\nninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n  \n \n  There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And\nwhat more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he\nchewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo\nwouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you\nnever knew who it would be.\n  \n \n  He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over\nthe hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that\nwas one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.\nChronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a\nslow pace.\n  \n \n  Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone.

The sag in his\nbody vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,\nwet thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n  \n \n  Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n  \n \n  He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies\nbeing ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of\nhating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it\nwould all be over.\n  \n \n  Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like\nfluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,\nhe squinted.\n  \n \n  \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good\ntrick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\""}
{"id":"Morgue_Ship_6","contents":"Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,\neyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n  \n \n  \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to\nLethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last\ntime anybody would ever board the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  alive. His stomach\nwent flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n  \n \n  If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end\nof shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind\nsearching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like\na smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,\nwater-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy\njet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be\neliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored\nbecause of his gun.\n  \n \n  Kriere would make odds impossible.\n  \n \n  Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n  \n \n  Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,\nfooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n  \n \n  Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade\nwhere Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,\nartery\u2014heart.\n  \n \n  There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and\nthis would be the last trip.\n  \n \n  Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n  \n \n  \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there\nwas too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in\nthe center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the\nstar-port.\"\n  \n \n  Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.\nBurnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back\nkept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet\nsings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,\nwhy\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of\nstars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about\nto be rescued.\n  \n \n  Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he\nwas about to end a ten-years' war.\n  \n \n  There was only\n   \n   one\n   \n  way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be\nfast.\n  \n \n  Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as\nit had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a\ngood sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered\ndirections, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies\nfrom space.\n  \n \n  Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,\ntoo.\n  \n \n  The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its\nslowness.\n  \n \n  It reached Kriere.\n  \n \n  Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n  \n \n  The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lethla watched.\n  \n \n  He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You\nknow, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . I believe it.\""}
{"id":"Morgue_Ship_7","contents":"And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all\naround Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There\nwas blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the\nhead, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n  \n \n  That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n  \n \n  Burnett spun about and leaped.\n  \n \n  The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n  \n \n  Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot\nramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back\nlike a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n  \n \n  Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and\nscreaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the\nroom swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and\nstarted laughing.\n  \n \n  He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever\nclaws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n  \n \n  Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's\nyoung face over him. Burnett groaned.\n  \n \n  Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.\nSomething wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last\ntrip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never\nhave to come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  , though, Rice.\" His voice\ntrailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll\nbe next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his\nmouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of\nthem out:\n  \n \n  \"Rice?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling\nthe shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is\nLethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling\nthis rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who\nwant to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back\nany way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen\nwarriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and\nBurnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a\nmillion miles.\n  \n \n  \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n  \n \n  Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to\ndissolve.\n  \n \n  Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n  \n \n  He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing\nout and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,\nthick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf\nat the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n  \n \n  And then he said softly:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   One hundred.\n   \n  \""}

He recognized her as\nold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.\nShe didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a\ngirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.\nShe was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified\ncriminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if\nshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,\nand not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\n  \n \n  Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n  His only problem would be staying alive for a year."}
{"id":"MUCK_MAN_2","contents":"An interview with a doctor from the Conversion Corps was required\nfor all persons who elected changeling status. The law stated that\npotential changelings must be fully informed of the rights and hazards\nof altered shape before they signed a release. The requirement held\nwhether or not the individual, like Asa, was already experienced.\n  \n \n  By the time humanity traveled to the stars, medical biology had made\nit possible to regenerate damaged or deficient organs of the body.\nRegeneration was limited only by advanced age. Sometime after a man's\ntwo hundredth year his body lost the ability to be coaxed into growing\nnew cells. A fifth set of teeth was usually one's last. As long as\nsenescence could be staved off, however, any man could have bulging\nbiceps and a pencil waist, if he could pay for the treatment.\n  \n \n  Until the medical associations declared such treatments unethical there\nwas even a short fad of deliberate deformities, with horns at the\ntemples particularly popular.\n  \n \n  From regeneration it was a short step to specialized regrowth. The\ntechniques were perfected to adapt humans to the dozen barely habitable\nworlds man had discovered. Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth\nin the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a\nman could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature\ncontrols than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets\na few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were\ngreater.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone\nwanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed\npermitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one\nyear as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had\nto spend in rehabilitation.\n  \n \n  \"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\"\nAsa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he\nasked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions.\n  \n \n  \"Four,\" answered the doctor.\n  \n \n  \"Squiffs for New Arcady. Adapted for climbing the skycraper trees and\nwith the arm structure modified into pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we\nneed spiderinos for Von Neumann Two. If you want the nearest thing we\nhave to Earth, there's Caesar's Moon, where we'd just have to double\nyour tolerance for carbon monoxide and make you a bigger and better\ngorilla than the natives. Last, of course, there's always a need for\nmuck men on Jordan's Planet.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to\nchoose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the\nalternatives.\n  \n \n  \"What's the pay range?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von\nNeumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\"\n  \n \n  Asa raised his eyebrows.\n  \n \n  \"Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the\nmud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the\nchangeling comfortable in his new environment?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure they do,\" said the doctor. \"We can make you think mud feels\nbetter than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a\ngrasshopper despite the double gravity. But we can't make you like the\nsight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Still,\" Asa mused aloud, \"it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the\nend of the year.\"\n  \n \n  He leaned forward to fill in the necessary form."}
{"id":"MUCK_MAN_3","contents":"Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special\nenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion\nchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa\nGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard\nto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once\none of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on\nspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he\ndecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all\nhe learned about space travel.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or\ncellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More\nimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and\nhad wanted to return.\n  \n \n  \"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The\nones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun\nto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to\ngo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine\nthousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that\nflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\n  \n \n  Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could\nunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while\nthe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic\nfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played\ntiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.\nElectrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but\nthe phenomenon remained a mystery.\n  \n \n  Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to\nquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only\nrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of\nlight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\n  \n \n  It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and\nfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had\never seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have\nmade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are\nthe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when\nyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes\nswooping out of nowhere at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the\nSliders?\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw grinned.\n  \n \n  \"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping\nfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.\nWhen the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in\nthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back\nand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter\ncomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live to\ntell the tale.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to\nlearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another\nphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was\npounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the\ndoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\n  \n \n  \"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\n  \n \n  Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning\nto lose consciousness.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\n  \n \n  He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before\nconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance\nto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the\nconversion tank right now.\n  \n \n  When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for\na long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\n  \n \n  It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his\neyes.\n  \n \n  Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one\nstand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that\nhis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his\nlower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward\nso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around\nas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with\nbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like\nclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of\nhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\n  \n \n  This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\n  \n \n  It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong\ntraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly\nemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under\nthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could\nstill weep.\n  \n \n  He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only\ntry hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve\nand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high\nas Kershaw's head.\n  \n \n  \"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll\ngo outside.\"\n  \n \n  Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of\nfabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as\nKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room\nwhere they had been left to revive from conversion."}
{"id":"MUCK_MAN_4","contents":"They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\n  \n \n  From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\na gun and a long knife.\n  \n \n  \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\neverywhere in proportion.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Graybar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n  \n \n  \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\n  \n \n  Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\n  \n \n  Furston laughed.\n  \n \n  \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\nwhere you eat.\"\n  \n \n  Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\nan observation tower on the roof.\n  \n \n  He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\n  \n \n  Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\n  \n \n  The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\n  \n \n  At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\ntwo were doing out here.\n  \n \n  \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\noperations.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\nGraybar aside.\n  \n \n  \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\nand work that muck.\"\n  \n \n  Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\n  \n \n  Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n  \n \n  \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\nstart shooting.\"\n  \n \n  At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\nmuch as on top of it.\n  \n \n  Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\nthe muck.\n  \n \n  \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw took a long look around.\n  \n \n  \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\n  \n \n  They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\nabout the operation was wrong.\n  \n \n  \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\nwatch.\n  \n \n  \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\nat it.\"\n  \n \n \n  A SLIDER EGG\n  \n \n \n  The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\nfor help. Asa looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Jump!\" he shouted.\n  \n \n  At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\nforward.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n  \n \n  \"On the way.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\ncharge.\n  \n \n  Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\nagain.\n  \n \n \n \n  Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\nshiver and lie still."}
{"id":"MUCK_MAN_5","contents":"Asa took a deep breath and looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.\nAsa leaped over to him.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good\none. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\n  \n \n  \"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\ngetting killed doing this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n  \n \n  \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n  \n \n  The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n  \n \n  \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\n  \n \n  While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.\nKershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred\npounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\n  \n \n  Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's\nshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\ncabin was crowded.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n  \n \n  \"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to\nHarriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might\nask him to tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that\nworried Asa.\n  \n \n  \"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In\nanother minute the helicopter was in the sky."}
{"id":"MUCK_MAN_6","contents":"A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty\nminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\n  \n \n  After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\n  \n \n  Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n  \n \n  \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\ncoming?\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\n  \n \n  If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n  \n \n  What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\""}

It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble\nwas yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of\nguards in Estates-General Correctional Institution\u2014better known to\nits inmates as the Jug\u2014and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent\nof trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to\nreach his captaincy.\n  \n \n  And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n  \n \n  He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like\nher into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she\ncouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n  \n \n  He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n  \n \n  The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\nguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the\n   \n   Civil\nService Guide to Prison Administration\n   \n  : \"Detainees will be permitted\nto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary\nwas a man who lived by the book.\n  \n \n  She burst out: \"I never got a chance!

Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Sodaro.\""}
{"id":"My_Lady_Greensleeves_2","contents":"Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was\nattractive and young\u2014not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off\nto a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the\ndisciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and\nlooked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for\nhim to judge their cases.\n  \n \n  He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your\ncell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you\nshould have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first\noffense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in\nthe mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The\nblock guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench,\nand she claimed the same business\u2014said she didn't understand when the\nother one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard\nwarned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n  \n \n  Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I\ndon't care. I don't care!\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n  \n \n  It was the only thing to do\u2014for her own sake as much as for his. He\nhad managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted\nto say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up\nforever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was\nclearly the next step for her.\n  \n \n  All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet\nto Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here.\nWhat's she in for?\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to\nviolate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her,\nCap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n  \n \n  Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n\"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the\nsmell from his nose.\n  \n \n  What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty\nbusiness? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the\nyard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage\u2014decent Civil\nService parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If\nanything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and\nlook what she had made of it.\n  \n \n  The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no\nexception, but with the difference that his is the one species that\ncreates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment\nthat clans formed, specialization began\u2014the hunters using the weapons\nmade by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the\nceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n  \n \n  Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From\nthe born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved\nto the point of smaller contact and less communication between the\nspecializations, until now they could understand each other on only the\nmost basic physical necessities\u2014and not even always then.\n  \n \n  But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree\nof civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation\nof each specialization\u2014social and genetic measures to make them\nbreed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man,\nor at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the\nspecializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer\nor Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized,\nwould be good at no specialization.\n  \n \n  And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups\nare the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal\nenforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and\ntouched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n  \n \n  \"Evening.\""}
{"id":"My_Lady_Greensleeves_3","contents":"O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those\nthings, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd\nnoticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to\nsweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\ncobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\njob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\ndidn't.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\nperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,\nnot as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He\n   \n   was\n   \n  proud of it. It was\n   \n   right\n   \n  that he should be proud of it. He was\ncivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\ndo a good, clean civil-service job.\n  \n \n  If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a\n   \n   clerk\n   \n  , he corrected\nhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\nproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014or\na mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  \n \n  Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\nbut they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Leary\nwas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\ntouch of envy how\n   \n   comfortable\n   \n  it must be to be a wipe\u2014a\n   \n   laborer\n   \n  .\nNo responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\nloaf, work and loaf.\n  \n \n  Of course, he wouldn't\n   \n   really\n   \n  want that kind of life, because he was\nCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\nweren't\n   \n   meant\n   \n  to be\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\nmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\nnext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\nthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\ncars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\nin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\nrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\ncertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\nCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  \n \n  So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called by\ndifferent names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\ncalled it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\nsnake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\nit is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  \n \n  And punishment is what you get.\n  \n \n  Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\ndisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\ninhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\nits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\nlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\nTheir names were Sauer and Flock.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\nwas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\nirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\nbelow, when she heard the yelling.\n  \n \n  \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n\"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  \n \n  The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\nguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was on\nthe outside.\n  \n \n  The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  \n \n  The outside guard shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Detail,\n   \n   halt\n   \n  !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\nthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\nhead of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\nof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,\nbecause there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\ncompany.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\nguards.\n  \n \n  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\nknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\nriled up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up\nalready.\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\nattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\ntanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\ncorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\ncould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,\nagainst the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\nrule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\nthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\nrestraining garment removed.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flat\non her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\nlike walking through molasses.\n  \n \n  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\nauntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\ndirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n\"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\nsay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\nhead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\nin the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\ntears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\npassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\nto retch."}
{"id":"My_Lady_Greensleeves_4","contents":"Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were\nlaborers\u2014\"wipes,\" for short\u2014or, at any rate, they had been once.\nThey had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even\nfor them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big,\ngrinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe\nfive-footer with the build of a water moccasin\u2014and the sad, stupid\neyes of a calf.\n  \n \n  Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.\n  \n \n  \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so\nas not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal\nlaughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble,\nFlock!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that,\nSauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"\n  \n \n  The howling started all over again.\n  \n \n  The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off\nthe tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take\na turn in here for a while?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I\ndon't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat\nyour head off!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he\ngrinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know\nyou can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut\n   \n   up\n   \n  !\" yelled the inside guard.\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help\nit. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting\nunder her skin. They weren't even\u2014even\n   \n   human\n   \n  , she told herself\nmiserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the\nsatisfaction of hearing her\u2014they were animals!\n  \n \n  Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly\nthat resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly\nnormal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against\nthe vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was\n   \n   good\n   \n  that\nSauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious\nsystem\u2014\n  \n \n  But did they have to scream so?\n  \n \n  The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to\nweeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!\n  \n \n  It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless,\nbecause noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very\nlong.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.\n  \n \n  \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his\nlittle round eyes looked terrified\u2014as perhaps they should have. Warden\nGodfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in\nthe Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the\nlast decent job he would have in his life.\n  \n \n  \"Trouble?\n   \n   What\n   \n  trouble?\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This\nafternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"\n  \n \n  The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what\ndid you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball\nin the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the\noutside\u2014an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes\ndon't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that\nit didn't\n   \n   smell\n   \n  right?\n  \n \n  \"For instance\u2014Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's\na pretty good old girl\u2014that's why she's the block orderly. She's a\nlifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women.\nBut today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she\ntold Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now\nMathias wouldn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about\nthat kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured\nhimself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a\ndesk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped\na pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the\nscalding heat.\n  \n \n  He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.\n  \n \n  \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have\nyour job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is\njust as important as my job,\" he said piously. \"\n   \n   Everybody's\n   \n  job is\njust as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to\nour own jobs. We don't want to try to\n   \n   pass\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was\nthat for the warden to talk to him?\n  \n \n  \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean,\nafter all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was\na great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  know you\ndon't want to worry about\n   \n   my\n   \n  end of running the prison.

You did\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\nYou're going to WHAT?\"\n  \n \n  He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.\nWhatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like\nclamshells in a steamer.\n  \n \n  \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n  \n \n  And he hung up\u2014more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his\nfingers.\n  \n \n  The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n  \n \n  Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it\ndidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.\nBecause five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the\nhard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  His name was Flock.\n  \n \n  He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,\nthought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the\ncrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the\nface of an agonized man.\n  \n \n  The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did\nhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that\nactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison\nrules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the\nGreensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case\nhad to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n  \n \n  \"Rest period\" it was called\u2014in the rule book. The inmates had a less\nlovely term for it."}
{"id":"My_Lady_Greensleeves_6","contents":"At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.\n  \n \n  Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat\nbed\u2014nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields\nhad a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out.\nScore one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed\nthe backs of her thighs gingerly\u2014and slowly, slowly, for the eddy\ncurrents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against\nrubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n  \n \n  The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She\nproudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.\nHe didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while\nshe attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male\nprisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was\ngrateful. At least she didn't have to live\n   \n   quite\n   \n  like a fig\u2014like an\nunderprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n  \n \n  Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's\nthe matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an\nasbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n  \n \n  Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n  \n \n  The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.\nCouldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real\nenough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I\u2014I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around\nFlock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in\nhere, he told himself\u2014not for the first time. And imagine, some people\ndidn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he\nrealized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.\nAlmost like meat scorching.\n  \n \n  It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the\nstinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to\nget all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if\nhe didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was\npretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little\nvain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability\nto make the rounds in two minutes, every time.\n  \n \n  Every time but this.\n  \n \n  For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n  \n \n  The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was\nFlock\u2014astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't\nbeen in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there\nwas something that glinted and smoked.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut\nwith pain.\n  \n \n  But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,\nsmoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though\nit had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God\nknows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how\u2014filed,\nfiled to sharpness over endless hours.\n  \n \n  No wonder Flock moaned\u2014the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly\ncooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv\nhad been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get\nhurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell\nhim not to, you hear?\"\n  \n \n  He was nearly fainting with the pain.\n  \n \n  But he hadn't let go.\n  \n \n  He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was Flock on the phone to the warden\u2014Flock with his eyes still\nstreaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing\nthe two bound deck guards.\n  \n \n  Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the\nvoice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and\nhating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt\nhimself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the\nguards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got\nyour guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n  \n \n  And he snapped the connection.\n  \n \n  O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n  \n \n  The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,\nand picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison\noperator: \"Get me the governor\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n \n   Riot!\n   \n \n \n  The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.\n  \n \n  It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority\nwith his manager and their wives\u2014and just when he was holding the\nPorkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.\n  \n \n  It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field\nto the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a\nRed Alert that was real.\n  \n \n  It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway\ncheckpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the\nnineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.\n  \n \n  Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n  \n \n  A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in\nevery limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of\nthousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the\nimpact of the news from the prison.\n  \n \n  For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely\na street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers\nrelaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the\ncorrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes\nand no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together."}
{"id":"My_Lady_Greensleeves_7","contents":"Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\nairmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\nthe alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\nand yawned and worried. An alert!

No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\nfor tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\ncouldn't get up yet\u2014it was the middle of the night.\n  \n \n  And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\nstruggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\narea to hear.\n  \n \n  They caught the words from a distance\u2014not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\ngasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n   \n   told\n   \n  Charlie they'd get out of hand and\u2014Alys, we aren't safe. You\nknow how they are about GI women!

The Jug! The governor himself had called\nthem out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\nlevels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n  \n \n  The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\nwhistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\nwere the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\ntheir picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\nin each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n  \n \n  They were ready for the breakout.\n  \n \n  But there wasn't any breakout.\n  \n \n  The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\nhelicopters hung on\u2014still ready, still waiting.\n  \n \n  The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\nThey stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\nThe prison below them was washed with light\u2014from the guard posts on\nthe walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\nthe guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n  \n \n  North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\nland, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\nlights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\nfrom their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded\ntenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\nwindow; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n  \n \n  \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\nyelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\nwhirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\nfrom the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\nright in the middle of it!\"\n  \n \n  He was partly right.

Finding\n    \n   one worth living for is the genuine problem!\n   \n \n \n \n  In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n  \n \n  \"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n  \n \n  \"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't think these are native?\"\n  \n \n  Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\n  \n \n  Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\n   \n   too\n   \n  old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n  \n \n  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long?\"\n  \n \n  Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make a rough estimate.\"\n  \n \n  Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens whistled.\n  \n \n  Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\n   \n   at least\n   \n  several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\n  \n \n  The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\n  \n \n  Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\n  \n \n  Which ought to give\n   \n   them\n   \n  , thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start."}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_2","contents":"While the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens\nremained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly\nat the walls.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since.\"\n  \n \n  \"No? How can you be sure?\" Steffens grunted. \"A space-borne race was\nroaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears\nat each other,\n   \n   that\n   \n  long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from\nVarius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these\nget to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?\"\n  \n \n  He kicked at the sand distractedly. \"And most important, where are they\nnow? A race with several thousand years....\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen thousand,\" Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:\n\"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized\nnow how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.\n  \n \n  \"But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?\nThere's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need\nto build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left\n   \n   something\n   \n  behind. The only reason they would need a camp would be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If the ship left and some of them stayed.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens nodded. \"But then the ship must have come back. Where did it\ngo?\" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black\nmidday sky. \"We'll never know.\"\n  \n \n  \"How about the other planets?\" Ball asked.\n  \n \n  \"The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The\nthird planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but\n   \n   it\n   \n  has a CO\n  2\n  atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"How about moons?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens shrugged. \"We could try them and find out.\""}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_3","contents":"The third planet was a blank, gleaming ball until they were in close,\nand then the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly,\nin places, the surface showed through. The ship went down through the\nclouds, falling the last few miles on her brakers. They came into the\nmisty gas below, leveled off and moved along the edge of the twilight\nzone.\n  \n \n  The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The third planet, a\nhot, heavy world which had no free oxygen and from which the monitors\nhad detected nothing, was all that was left. Steffens expected nothing,\nbut he had to try.\n  \n \n  At a height of several miles, the ship moved up the zone, scanning,\nmoving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint dark\noutlines of bare rocks and hills moved by below.\n  \n \n  Steffens turned the screen to full magnification and watched silently.\n  \n \n  After a while he saw a city.\n  \n \n  The main screen being on, the whole crew saw it. Someone shouted and\nthey stopped to stare, and Steffens was about to call for altitude when\nhe saw that the city was dead.\n  \n \n  He looked down on splintered walls that were like cloudy glass pieces\nrising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center\nof the city, there was a huge, charred hole at least three miles in\ndiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved.\n  \n \n  Steffens went down low to make sure, then brought the ship around and\nheaded out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun.\nThe rocks rolled by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then\nthere were more cities\u2014all with the black depression, the circular\nstamp that blotted away and fused the buildings into nothing.\n  \n \n  No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen a war, for\nthere had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundred\nyears.\n  \n \n  The ship circled around to the dark side of the planet. When they were\ndown below a mile, the radiation counters began to react. It became\napparent, from the dials, that there could be nothing alive.\n  \n \n  After a while Ball said: \"Well, which do you figure? Did our friends\nfrom the fourth planet do this, or were they the same people as these?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not take his eyes from the screen. They were coming around\nto the daylight side.\n  \n \n  \"We'll go down and look for the answer,\" he said. \"Break out the\nradiation suits.\"\n  \n \n  He paused, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to\nthis world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one\nof the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then,\nthousands of years ago. He began to realize how important it really was\nthat Ball's question be answered.\n  \n \n  When the ship had gone very low, looking for a landing site, Steffens\nwas still by the screen. It was Steffens, then, who saw the thing move.\n  \n \n  Down far below, it had been a still black shadow, and then it moved.\nSteffens froze. And he knew, even at that distance, that it was a robot.\n  \n \n \n \n  Tiny and black, a mass of hanging arms and legs, the thing went gliding\ndown the slope of a hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a full second,\nsaw the dull ball of its head tilt upward as the ship came over, and\nthen the hill was past."}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_4","contents":"Quickly Steffens called for height. The ship bucked beneath him and\nblasted straight up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck.\nSteffens remained by the screen, increasing the magnification as the\nship drew away. And he saw another, then two, then a black gliding\ngroup, all matched with bunches of hanging arms.\n  \n \n  Nothing alive but robots, he thought,\n   \n   robots\n   \n  . He adjusted to full\nclose up as quickly as he could and the picture focused on the screen.\nBehind him he heard a crewman grunt in amazement.\n  \n \n  A band of clear, plasticlike stuff ran round the head\u2014it would be the\neye, a band of eye that saw all ways. On the top of the head was a\nsingle round spot of the plastic, and the rest was black metal, joined,\nhe realized, with fantastic perfection. The angle of sight was now\nalmost perpendicular. He could see very little of the branching arms of\nthe trunk, but what had been on the screen was enough. They were the\nmost perfect robots he had ever seen.\n  \n \n  The ship leveled off. Steffens had no idea what to do; the sudden sight\nof the moving things had unnerved him. He had already sounded the\nalert, flicked out the defense screens. Now he had nothing to do. He\ntried to concentrate on what the League Law would have him do.\n  \n \n  The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was forbidden\nunder any circumstances. But could a bunch of robots be called a race?\nThe Law said nothing about robots because Earthmen had none. The\nbuilding of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any\nrate, Steffens thought, he had made contact already.\n  \n \n  While Steffens stood by the screen, completely bewildered for the first\ntime in his space career, Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly.\nFrom the bright new bruise on his cheek, Steffens guessed that the\nsudden climb had caught him unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.\n  \n \n  \"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"\n  \n \n  \"They were.\"\n  \n \n  Ball stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion\nof dots in the mist.\n  \n \n  \"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"\n  \n \n  Ball was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly\nat Steffens.\n  \n \n  \"Well, what do we do now?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite\npossibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and\nsee if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Can\n   \n  we go down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot\nconstitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his\nfingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all.\nThey could be the natives.\"\n  \n \n  Ball gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet\u2014the brains of\nthem, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added,\n\"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"\n  \n \n  Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the\nscreen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.\n  \n \n  The Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed\nto do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking\nfor the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of\nhuman colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very\nclearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this\nrobot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the\nother, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of\nduty.\n  \n \n  And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him,\nthat the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and\ngone.\n  \n \n  He stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought\nopened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an\noutpost?\n  \n \n \n   An outpost!\n   \n \n \n  He turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was\nlost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and\nstirred up trouble....\n  \n \n  The thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away.\nA voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our\ndesire is only to serve....\n   \n  \""}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_5","contents":"\"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously\nthrough shocked lips.\n  \n \n  Everyone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens\nwas not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.\n  \n \n  \"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is\nonly to serve.\"\n  \n \n  And then the robots sent a\n   \n   picture\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  As perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took\nshape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone\nagainst a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots.\nWith slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the\nhanging arms of its side, of its\n   \n   right\n   \n  side, and extended it toward\nSteffens, a graciously offered hand.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized\nright away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The\nrobot mind had helped.\n  \n \n  When the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He\nwaited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of\nthe robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if\nthey wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more\nhappened, he began to lose his fear.\n  \n \n  While the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back.\nHe concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good\nmeasure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking\nhands.\n  \n \n  \"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what\n   \n   they\n   \n  had said, and\nexplained: \"We have come from the stars.\"\n  \n \n  It was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered\nbaffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order\nsomeone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and\n   \n   think\n   \n  a message?\n  \n \n  No, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:\n  \n \n  \"We request\u2014we respectfully request permission to land upon your\nplanet.\""}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_6","contents":"Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n  \n \n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were."}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_7","contents":"After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\n  \n \n  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\n   \n   feel\n   \n  their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\n  \n \n  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\n  \n \n  Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\n  \n \n  Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n  \n \n  \"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\n  \n \n  The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n  \n \n  \"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\n  \n \n  The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n  \n \n  \"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n  \n \n  \"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\n   \n   Makers\n   \n  , which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\n  \n \n  It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\n  \n \n  The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\n  \n \n  Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n  \n \n  \"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n  \n \n  \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\n  \n \n  Could that be\n   \n   pain\n   \n  in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\n  \n \n  War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\n  \n \n  He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ,\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  could live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n  \n \n  The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\n  \n \n  If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n  \n \n  Were they immortal?"}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_8","contents":"\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n  \n \n  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n  \n \n  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n  \n \n  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens tried to understand that.\n  \n \n  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n  \n \n  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\n  \n \n  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n  \n \n  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n  \n \n  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n  \n \n  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n  \n \n  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n  \n \n  \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\n   \n   Factory\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The Factory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\n  \n \n  Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n  \n \n  \"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\n  \n \n  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace."}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_9","contents":"The Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\n  \n \n  Surprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\n  \n \n  Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\n  \n \n  But when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\n  \n \n  At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\n  \n \n  It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\n  \n \n  Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\n  \n \n  He had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had."}
{"id":"Orphans_of_the_Void_10","contents":"\"What do you\n   \n   do\n   \n  ?\" Steffens asked.\n  \n \n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled."}

It\n   \n   was\n   \n  something big to plan a crime.\nA civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting,\nblackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA\u2014Crime\nPrevention Association. There were no longer any prisons\u2014CPA officials\nhad declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent\ncrime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of\ningenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime\nalmost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men\nin the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.\n  \n \n  No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill\nsomeone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he\nwasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all\ncriminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock\ntreatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and\na dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few\ncriminals\u2014only ten in New York during the past year\u2014any city could\nafford the CPA hospitals.\n  \n \n  The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because\nit did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with\nprisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.\n  \n \n  And, ironically, a man who\n   \n   did\n   \n  commit a crime was a sort of hero. He\nwas a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses\nto kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a\nhero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was\u2014when he left one of the\nCPA hospitals\u2014a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a\nman who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.\nAnd therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatment\nwas commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the\nword an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" the girl said. \"I'm honored.

There was something\nwrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with\nbushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something\nof his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate\nhadn't made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men\nto high political positions were women.\n  \n \n  Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly,\nlikable person.

The President of the United States was a capable\nman, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked\nsomething like a bulldog had been elected as New York's police\ncommissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters.\n  \n \n  \"Where's the girl?\" Joe asked.\n  \n \n  \"I processed her while you were out cold.

{"id":"PICK_A_CRIME_8","contents":"When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a\nchild, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid\nof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\nat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\nown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\nfeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\nhim to make a mistake.\n  \n \n  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\nTwenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\nalleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\nfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\nup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n  \n \n  If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\nwere discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received,\nthe message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\nin two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\nmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\nto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\nsomeone's pocket at forty yards.\n  \n \n  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\nstore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\nof business for years.\n  \n \n  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devices\nplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\nheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\nmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\npoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\nof it would kill a human.\n  \n \n  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\nsupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\nof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\npointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\nof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\nthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n  \n \n  And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\nof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\nthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\ndifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\ntheir aim was infallible."}

With the huge atomic power plants scattered across\nthe country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously\nlow prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power\nrequired to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of\nfour dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of\nthe devices had cost even less.\n  \n \n  And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at\nthe individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked\nsubliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio\nor watching television, if a person heard station identification, he\ninvariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.\nIf he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters\ndeclaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he\nalways found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit\nanything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.\n  \n \n  It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and\nheard them without thinking about them.

That is,\ninstead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls\nwere, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and\nthe owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating\nanother room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by\nlaw, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but\nevidently he didn't want to pay for installation.\n  \n \n  When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to\nclose the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the\nbed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at\nnight and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.\n  \n \n  Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the\ncrime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it."}

Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded American\nInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throw\na cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a woman\nlike Marge\u2014\n  \n \n  It's so\n   \n   permanent\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in the\nBlissful 'Fifties\u2014but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,\nand all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got\ntheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved Spouse\nCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life if\nI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.\n  \n \n  You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a man\nhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.\n  \n \n  So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keep\nMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.\n  \n \n  Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes\nand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was where\nthe dream stopped.\n  \n \n  She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long\nenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was\ncrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling\ndetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,\nwhich happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly\nheadache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half\nshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we\ngot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case."}

His wife is no joy to live\nwith either, but at least he could take a spin down to Rio once in a\nwhile with one of the stenographers and get away with it.\n  \n \n  I knew better than to try. Marge was already so jealous that I couldn't\neven smile at the company receptionist without a twinge of guilt. Give\nMarge something real to howl about, and I'd be ready for the Rehab\nCenter in a week.\n  \n \n  But I'd underestimated Marge. She didn't need anything real, as I found\nout when Jeree came along.\n  \n \n  Business was booming and the secretaries at the office got shuffled\naround from time to time. Since I had an executive-type job, I got an\nexecutive-type secretary. Her name was Jeree and she was gorgeous. As\na matter of fact, she was better than gorgeous. She was the sort of\nsecretary every businessman ought to have in his office. Not to do any\nwork\u2014just to sit there.\n  \n \n  Jeree was tall and dark, and she could convey more without saying\nanything than I ever dreamed was possible. The first day she was\nthere, she conveyed to me very clearly that if I cared to supply the\nopportunity, she'd be glad to supply the motive.\n  \n \n  That night, I could tell that Marge had been thinking something over\nduring the day. She let me get the first bite of dinner halfway to my\nmouth, and then she said, \"I hear you got a new secretary today.\"\n  \n \n  I muttered something into my coffee cup and pretended not to hear.\n  \n \n  Marge turned on her Accusing Look #7. \"I also hear that she's\nfive-foot-eight and tapes out at 38-25-36 and thinks you're handsome.\"\n  \n \n  Marge had quite a spy system.\n  \n \n  \"She couldn't be much of a secretary,\" she added.\n  \n \n  \"She's a perfectly good secretary,\" I blurted, and kicked myself\nmentally. I should have known Marge's traps by then.\n  \n \n  Marge exploded. I didn't get any supper, and she was still going strong\nat midnight. I tried to argue, but when Marge got going, there was no\nstopping her. I had my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned.\n  \n \n  Harry Folsom administered the\n   \n   coup de grace\n   \n  at coffee next morning.\n\"What you need is an Ego Prime,\" he said with a grin. \"Solve all your\nproblems. I hear they work like a charm.\"\n  \n \n  I set my coffee cup down. Bells were ringing in my ears. \"Don't be\nridiculous. It's against the law. Anyway, I wouldn't think of such a\nthing. It's\u2014it's indecent.\"\n  \n \n  Harry shrugged. \"Just joking, old man, just joking. Still, it's fun to\nthink about, eh? Freedom from wife. Absolutely safe and harmless. Not\neven too expensive, if you've got the right contacts. And I've got a\nfriend who knows a guy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Just then, Jeree walked past us and flashed me a big smile. I gripped\nmy cup for dear life and still spilled coffee on my tie.\n  \n \n  As I said, a guy gets fed up.\n  \n \n  And maybe opportunity would only knock once.\n  \n \n  And an Ego Prime would solve all my problems, as Harry had told me."}
{"id":"PRIME_DIFFERENCE_3","contents":"It was completely illegal, of course. The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n  \n \n  From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n  \n \n  The law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n  \n \n  But everybody knew that if you\n   \n   really\n   \n  wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one. Black\nmarket prices were steep and you ran your own risk, but it could be\ndone.\n  \n \n  Harry Folsom told his friend who knew a guy, and a few greenbacks got\nlost somewhere, and I found myself looking at a greasy little man with\na black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse\noff lower Broadway.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes,\" the little man said. \"Mr. Faircloth.

We never see the\nmerchandise ourselves\u2014\" He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"Now were\nyou interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?\"\n  \n \n  I assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back door\nfor Utility models.\n  \n \n  \"Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful\nworkmanship.

You want perfect duplication.\nYes, indeed. Domestic situations can be\u2014awkward, shall we say. Very\nawkward\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems were\nany affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom.\n  \n \n  \"We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement.

{"id":"PRIME_DIFFERENCE_5","contents":"Practical androids had been a pipe dream until Hunyadi invented the\nNeuro-pantograph. Hunyadi had no idea in the world what to do with it\nonce he'd invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers bought\nhim body and soul, sub-contracted the problems of anatomy, design,\nartistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with\nthe modern Ego Primes we have today.\n  \n \n  I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked\noutside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it pretty\nwoozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in the\nrecovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Prime\nwhen I got him. Finally the door opened and the head technician walked\nin, followed by a tall, sandy-haired man with worried blue eyes and a\ntired look on his face.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Meet George Faircloth Prime,\" the technician said, grinning at me like\na nursing mother.\n  \n \n  I shook hands with myself. Good firm handshake, I thought admiringly.\nNothing flabby about it.\n  \n \n  I slapped George Prime on the shoulder happily. \"Come on, Brother,\" I\nsaid. \"You've got a job to do.\"\n  \n \n  But, secretly, I was wondering what Jeree was doing that night.\n  \n \n  George Prime had remote controls, as well as a completely recorded\nneurological analogue of his boss, who was me. George Prime thought\nwhat I thought about the same things I did in the same way I did. The\nonly difference was that what I told George Prime to do, George Prime\ndid.\n  \n \n  If I told him to go to a business conference in San Francisco and make\nthe smallest possible concessions for the largest possible orders,\nhe would go there and do precisely that. His signature would be my\nsignature. It would hold up in court.\n  \n \n  And if I told him that my wife Marge was really a sweet, good-hearted\ngirl and that he was to stay home and keep her quiet and happy any time\nI chose, he'd do that, too.\n  \n \n  George Prime was a duplicate of me right down to the sandy hairs on\nthe back of my hands. Our fingerprints were the same. We had the same\nmannerisms and used the same figures of speech. The only physical\ndifference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression\nburied in the hair above his ear. A little pressure there would stop\nGeorge Prime dead in his tracks.\n  \n \n  He was so lifelike, even I kept forgetting that he was basically just a\npile of gears.\n  \n \n  I'd planned very carefully how I meant to use him, of course.\n  \n \n  Every man who's been married eight years has a sanctuary. He builds it\nup and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's\nnatural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things. Sometimes\nit takes him years of diligent work to establish his hideout and be\nconfident that it will stay inviolate, but if he starts early enough,\nand sticks with it long enough, and is fierce enough and persistent\nenough and crafty enough, he'll probably win in the end. The girls hate\nhim for it, but he'll win.\n  \n \n  With some men, it's just a box on their dressers, or a desk, or a\ncorner of an unused back room. But I had set my sights high early in\nthe game. With me, it was the whole workshop in the garage."}
{"id":"PRIME_DIFFERENCE_6","contents":"At first, Marge tried open warfare. She had to clean the place up, she\nsaid. I told her I didn't\n   \n   want\n   \n  her to clean it up. She could clean\nthe whole house as often as she chose, but\n   \n   I\n   \n  would clean up the\nworkshop.\n  \n \n  After a couple of sharp engagements on that field, Marge staged a\nstrategic withdrawal and reorganized her attack. A little pile of wood\nshavings would be on the workshop floor one night and be gone the next.\nA wrench would be back on the rack\u2014upside down, of course. An open\npaint can would have a cover on it.\n  \n \n  I always knew. I screamed loudly and bitterly. I ranted and raved. I\nswore I'd rig up a booby-trap with a shotgun.\n  \n \n  So she quit trying to clean in there and just went in once in a while\nto take a look around. I fixed that with the old toothpick-in-the-door\nroutine. Every time she so much as set foot in that workshop, she had a\nbattle on her hands for the next week or so. She could count on it. It\nwas that predictable.\n  \n \n  She never found out how I knew, and after seven years or so, it wore\nher down. She didn't go into the workshop any more.\n  \n \n  As I said, you've got to be persistent, but you'll win.\n  \n \n  Eventually.\n  \n \n  If you're\n   \n   really\n   \n  persistent.\n  \n \n  Now all my effort paid off. I got Marge out of the house for an hour\nor two that day and had George Prime delivered and stored in the big\ncloset in the workshop. They hooked his controls up and left me a\nmanual of instructions for running him. When I got home that night,\nthere he was, just waiting to be put to work.\n  \n \n  After supper, I went out to the workshop\u2014to get the pipe I'd left\nthere, I said. I pushed George Prime's button, winked at him and\nswitched on the free-behavior circuits.\n  \n \n  \"Go to it, Brother,\" I said.\n  \n \n  George Prime put my pipe in his mouth, lit it and walked back into the\nhouse.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later, I heard them fighting.\n  \n \n  It sounded so familiar that I laughed out loud. Then I caught a cab on\nthe corner and headed uptown.\n  \n \n  We had quite a night, Jeree and I. I got home just about time to start\nfor work, and sure enough, there was George Prime starting my car,\nbusiness suit on, briefcase under his arm.\n  \n \n  I pushed the recall and George Prime got out of the car and walked into\nthe workshop. He stepped into his cradle in the closet. I turned him\noff and then drove away in the car.\n  \n \n  Bless his metallic soul, he'd even kissed Marge good-by for me!"}
{"id":"PRIME_DIFFERENCE_7","contents":"Needless to say, the affairs of George Faircloth took on a new sparkle\nwith George Prime on hand to cover the home front.\n  \n \n  For the first week, I was hardly home at all. I must say I felt a\nlittle guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all\nthe time\u2014he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that\nhe literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same\nwhenever I took him out of his closet.\n  \n \n  \"She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,\" I'd say. \"You'll learn\nto like her after a bit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I like her,\" George Prime said. \"You told me to, didn't you?\nStop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.\"\n  \n \n  He sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. \"You're sure\nyou understand the exchange mechanism?\" I asked. I didn't want any\nfoul-ups there, as you can imagine.\n  \n \n  \"Perfectly,\" said George Prime. \"When you buzz the recall, I wait for\nthe first logical opportunity I can find to come out to the workshop,\nand you take over.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you might get nervous. You might inadvertently tip her off.\"\n  \n \n  George Prime looked pained. \"Really, old man! I'm a Super Deluxe model,\nremember? I don't have fourteen activated Hunyadi tubes up in this\ncranial vault of mine just for nothing. You're the one that's nervous.\nI'll take care of everything. Relax.\"\n  \n \n  So I did.\n  \n \n  Jeree made good all her tacit promises and then some. She had a very\ncozy little apartment on 34th Street where we went to relax after\na hard day at the office. When we weren't doing the town, that is.\nAs long as Jeree didn't try too much conversation, everything was\nwonderful.\n  \n \n  And then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the\naccounting department. Or Dorothy in promotion. Or Jane. Or Ingrid.\n  \n \n  I could go on at some length, but I won't. I was building quite a\nreputation for myself around the office.\n  \n \n  Of course, it was like buying your first 3-V set. In a week or so, the\nnovelty wears off a little and you start eating on schedule again. It\ntook a little while, but I finally had things down to a reasonable\nprogram.\n  \n \n  Tuesday and Thursday nights, I was informally \"out\" while formally\n\"in.\" Sometimes I took Sunday nights \"out\" if things got too sticky\naround the house over the weekend. The rest of the time, George Prime\ncooled his heels in his closet. Locked up, of course. Can't completely\ntrust a wife to observe a taboo, no matter how well trained she is.\n  \n \n  There, was an irreconcilable amount of risk. George Prime had to\nquick-step some questions about my work at the office\u2014there was no\nway to supply him with current data until the time for his regular\ntwo-month refill and pattern-accommodation at the laboratory. In the\nmeantime, George Prime had to make do with what he had.\n  \n \n  But as he himself pointed out he was a Super Deluxe model."}

We hadn't had a\ngood fight in days. Weeks, come to think of it.\n  \n \n  I thought it over and shrugged. Old age, I figured. She was bound to\nmellow sometime.\n  \n \n  But pretty soon I began to wonder if she wasn't mellowing a little too\nmuch.\n  \n \n  One night when I got home, she kissed me almost as though she really\nmeant it. There wasn't an unpleasant word all through dinner, which\nhappened to be steak with mushrooms, served in the dining room (!) by\ncandlelight (!!) with dinner music that Marge could never bear, chiefly\nbecause I liked it.\n  \n \n  We sat over coffee and cigarettes, and it seemed almost like old\ntimes.\n   \n   Very\n   \n  old times, in fact I even caught myself looking at Marge\nagain\u2014really\n   \n   looking\n   \n  at her, watching the light catch in her hair,\nalmost admiring the sparkle in her brown eyes.

That's elemental psychology. I can\ngive you page references.\"\n  \n \n  I ought to mention that George Prime had a complete set of basic texts\nrun into his circuits, at a slightly additional charge.

She sympathized\nwith my hard day at the office and agreed heartily that the boss,\ndespite all appearances, was in reality a jabbering idiot. After\ndinner, I suggested a movie, but Marge gave me an odd sort of look and\nsaid she thought it would be much nicer to spend the evening at home by\nthe fire.\n  \n \n  I'd just gotten settled with the paper when she came into the living\nroom and sat down beside me.

There was no mistaking the disappointment in her\nvoice. Now I knew that things were out of hand.\n  \n \n  The next evening, I activated George Prime and caught the taxi at the\ncorner, but I called Ruby and broke my date with her. I took in an\nearly movie alone and was back by ten o'clock. I left the cab at the\ncorner and walked quietly up the path toward the garage.\n  \n \n  Then I stopped.

On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n  \n \n  \"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again.

He'll be back in a moment.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n  \n \n  \"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both.

Her feet scraped on\nsome projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher.

He looked out across the\nheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly\naround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and\nstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully\nbecause of the lesser gravitation.\n  \n \n  Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha he\nwas well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick and\npowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features\nwere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were\na curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore\nno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his\nrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n  \n \n  The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the\nlittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to\nwait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to\nbring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space\ncruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's\nmentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a\nplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n  \n \n  Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them\nall only three had proven worthy of consideration.

It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished\nmetal at the reflection of himself!\n  \n \n  The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious\ntime.

{"id":"QUEST_OF_THIG_2","contents":"Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had\nground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid\ndesolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was\ngoing stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that\nshiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly\nhe had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't\ndared touch the machine since.\n  \n \n  For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never\nbeen further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised\nhis wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on\na trailer tour of the\n   \n   West\n   \n  that very summer. Since that promise, he\ncould not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and\nbe-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out\nof his subconscious.

He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand\nclamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of\nhis head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more."}
{"id":"QUEST_OF_THIG_3","contents":"\"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured\nEarthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that\nmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n  \n \n  \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he\nwears he might be Thig.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we\nwill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to\nthe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without\narousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the\ntwo inner planets.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear\nthese clumsy sheathing upon his body.

Carefully\ncultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they\nknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely\nlacking in their early training and later life. They were trained\nantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde\nwere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling\nrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,\ntheir love-life, their everything!\n  \n \n  So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped\non two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to\none another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their\nheads.\n  \n \n  For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain\ndry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman\nproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped\ncompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his\nbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured\nbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n  \n \n  \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\n\"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new\nbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is\naroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming\nbaubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and\npainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship\nand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running\ninland to his home.\n  \n \n  Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood\nmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place\nwhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that\nold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of\nthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his\npocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n  \n \n  He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on\nthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little\nEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his\nacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from\naround his heart.\n  \n \n  Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the\ndead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men\nhad no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other\nprimitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding\nthe emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n  \n \n  Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,\ntrembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked\nachingly up into his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called\nup at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that\nSaddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"\nand three other editors asked for shorts soon.\""}

All the better this\nway, he realized\u2014more natural.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the\nglittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used\nto hunt treasure and I found an old chest.

{"id":"QUEST_OF_THIG_5","contents":"\"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks\nlater and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt\nbeside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n  \n \n  \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went\non as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as\nbeautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n  \n \n  Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the\nexposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car\nand the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living\nquarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the\nchaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n  \n \n  Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows\nand report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,\nincluding Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force\nto wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,\nof course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be\nlanded. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,\nimperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the\nHordes?\n  \n \n  Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the\ndead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three\nmonths he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed\nfor reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady\nglory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had\nexperienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against\nthe wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt\ndivision of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer\nthought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty\nadded zest to every day's life.\n  \n \n  The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to\nthe Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,\nwould one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to\nthe progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan\ncivilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain\nwell-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast\nmechanical hives.\n  \n \n  There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had\ncaught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath\nthem. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid\nred the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and\ncactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,\nwho nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son\nof Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n  \n \n  Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better\nof his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to\nblast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the\nroad toward the beach.\n  \n \n  The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly\nbut they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the\ndoor and called after him.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n  \n \n  He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she\nwould have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of\nperson when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a\nhand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n  \n \n  Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the\nautumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that\nlived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked\nin the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the\ncareless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be\nsapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never\nbe written, but he toyed with the idea.\n  \n \n  So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from\nthe unquestioning worship of the Horde!"}
{"id":"QUEST_OF_THIG_6","contents":"\"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report\non the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now\nhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to\nOrtha at once.\n  \n \n  \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the\ncomplete destruction of all biped life upon it.

I imagine that\nthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient\nfor the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and\nexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for\nexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once\na race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own\ndegree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a\nrace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way\nof a superior race?

Some form of fever perhaps native to this\nworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n  \n \n  Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the\nsquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments\nand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the\nwalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of\na decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of\nthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or\nvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n  \n \n  The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble\nclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's\nbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly\nhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children\nof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must\nstand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an\nempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.\n  \n \n  \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a\nwoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need\nthis planet.\"\n  \n \n  Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its\ncase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac\nof the finest members of the Horde.\n  \n \n  \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.\n\"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we\nmust eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n  \n \n  Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick\njaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying\nthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into\nKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it\ncould be uttered.\n  \n \n  Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness\nand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and\nfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly\nstruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand\nfought against that lone arm of Thig."}

Thig's fingers pressed down\nupon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the\ndecomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water.

He\nwas in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of\nbruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon\nhis skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed\nhim with those savage blows upon the head.\n  \n \n  Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his\nancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now\nowed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently\nused the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his\nunconscious body.\n  \n \n  Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control\nroom. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies\nthrough the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered\nwhy he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures\nof his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible\nfor his sudden madness.\n  \n \n  The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association\nof memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack\nbeneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the\nweapon. He tugged it free.\n  \n \n  In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck\ntoward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,\nthe metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp\nscuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled\nout into a senseless whinny.\n  \n \n  Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length\nof the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared\nfull into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there\nwatching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten\nlips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and\nchest. He was a madman!\n  \n \n  The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and\nnow the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all\nserved to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.\nThe shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of\nthe Orthan.\n  \n \n  So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad\nstare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over\nthe skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that\nvictory had given him to drive him along.\n  \n \n  He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought\nsobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After\nall, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking\nof while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n  \n \n  He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and\nread the last few nervously scrawled lines:\n  \n \n \n   Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that\nstrikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent\nthere. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and\ndestroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.\nAlready I feel the insidious virus of....\n   \n \n \n  And there his writing ended abruptly.\n  \n \n  Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the\nplanet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's\npath she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger\non 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n  \n \n  Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of\na half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's\nhull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n  \n \n  He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving\nhim from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new\nbody was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the\nemotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months\nbefore, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his.\n  \n \n \n \n   Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the\nrockets driving him from the parent ship.\n   \n \n \n \n  He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the\ngreat exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no\nregret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first\nexistence.\n  \n \n  He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the\nmonotonous routine of existence that had once been his\u2014and his heart\nthrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days\nhe had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n  \n \n  He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a\ntiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The\nrocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching\nthe ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n  \n \n  He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the\nroundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion\nthat all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his\nrockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that\ncrowded his mind.\n  \n \n  He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time\nhe had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys\nbelow. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,\ndespite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer\nspace.\n  \n \n  He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight\ndifferences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers\ntrembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said\na brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very\ndeeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories\nwere hot, bitter pains."}

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply."}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2","contents":"The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n  \n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it."}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_3","contents":"Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn.

Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb."}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_4","contents":"Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n  \n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n  \n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n  \n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n  \n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n  \n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n  \n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n  \n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman\u2014and ugly, my son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n  \n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n  \n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n  \n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n  \n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n  \n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n  \n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n  \n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n  \n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n  \n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave."}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_5","contents":"The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n  \n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n  \n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n  \n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal\u2014gold, silver and brass\u2014vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n  \n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped\u2014mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n  \n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n  \n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n  \n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n  \n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n  \n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n  \n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n  \n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n  \n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n  \n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n  \n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n  \n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n  \n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n  \n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner."}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6","contents":"The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n  \n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n  \n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n  \n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n  \n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n  \n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n  \n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n  \n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n  \n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n  \n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n  \n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n  \n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n  \n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n  \n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n  \n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes\u2014-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\""}

Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n  \n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n  \n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n  \n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n  \n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n  \n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n  \n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n  \n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n  \n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged\u2014thickened\u2014as he saw the features of Noork.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\""}
{"id":"Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8","contents":"A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe.

Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark.

Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics.

A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him.

In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\n   \n   meloderge\n   \n  that was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\n  \n \n  Outside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n  \n \n  \"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\n  \n \n  The other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"And why, Ryd?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\n   \n   then\n   \n  , but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n  \n \n  \"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\n  \n \n  Ryd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\""}
{"id":"Saboteur_of_Space_3","contents":"All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in."}
{"id":"Saboteur_of_Space_4","contents":"It was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\n  \n \n  They emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\n  \n \n  As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\n  \n \n  And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\n  \n \n  Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\n  \n \n  And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n  \n \n  \"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where else?\" said Mury."}
{"id":"Saboteur_of_Space_5","contents":"The official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\u2014as it came\nabout\u2014just a little too late.\n  \n \n  The guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\n   \n   Shahrazad's\n   \n  airlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\n  \n \n  The slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" he inquired frostily.\n  \n \n  \"What goes on here?\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \"The crew's signaled all\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\" interrupted\nthe tall man with asperity. \"The City is naturally interested in the\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\" He paused,\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \"I\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\"\n  \n \n  The guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\n  \n \n  Fully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\npointing at its licensed owner.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \"that you'd better come aboard\nwith us.\"\n  \n \n  The guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\u2014for he was still very\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\n  \n \n  Above, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\n  \n \n  \"Cover him, Ryd,\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\" The outer gangway had slid up,\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel."}
{"id":"Saboteur_of_Space_6","contents":"Mury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\n  \n \n  Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n  \n \n  \"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\n  \n \n  He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\n  \n \n  The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\n  \n \n  Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n  \n \n  \"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\n   \n   ex officio\n   \n  the brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\n  \n \n  He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yet Arliess.\"\n  \n \n  \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\n  \n \n  Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\n  \n \n  A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\n  \n \n  Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\n  \n \n  Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\n  \n \n  Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n  \n \n  \"What's that, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that well enough.

Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess.

Arthritic joints sent\nflashes of pain along his limbs. Here she comes, he thought, feeling\nneither glad nor sad.\n  \n \n  He coughed and slipped polarized goggles over his eyes.\n  \n \n  The spaceport emerged bathed in infra red. Hangars, cradles, freighter\ncatapults and long runways stood out in sharp, diamond-clear detail.\nHigh up, beyond the cone of illumination, a detached triple row of\nbright specks\u2014portholes of the liner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  \u2014sank slowly down.\n  \n \n  There was no eagerness in him. Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\nto die.\n  \n \n  As though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\nsnuggle into the cradle's ribs.\n  \n \n  The passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Attention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\nminutes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\n  \n \n \n   Red signal.\n   \n  In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\n  \n \n  He felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\n  \n \n  A hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\n  \n \n  Dropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n   \n  ,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\n  \n \n  He clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\n  \n \n  The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\n  \n \n  The loud-speaker blared. \"\n   \n   Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  With the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\n  \n \n  Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n  \n \n  \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in."}
{"id":"SIGNAL_RED_2","contents":"Captain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n  \n \n  \"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\n  \n \n  The captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n  \n \n  \"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\n  \n \n  Shano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\n  \n \n  Descending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n  \n \n  \"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\n   \n   Rourke\n   \n  . \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\n  \n \n  In his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\n  \n \n  What were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited."}
{"id":"SIGNAL_RED_3","contents":"The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\n  \n \n  Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\n  \n \n  The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\n  \n \n  Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\n  \n \n  Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\n  \n \n  He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\n  \n \n  He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\n  \n \n  A bell clanged.\n  \n \n  Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\n  \n \n  Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\n  \n \n  Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears."}
{"id":"SIGNAL_RED_4","contents":"The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n  \n \n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n   \n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n  \n \n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n  \n \n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n  \n \n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n  \n \n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n  \n \n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n  \n \n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n  \n \n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n  \n \n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n  \n \n  \"Hold fire.\"\n  \n \n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Stand by.\"\n  \n \n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n  \n \n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n  \n \n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n  \n \n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n  \n \n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n  \n \n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n  \n \n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n  \n \n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n  \n \n  Shano blinked.\n  \n \n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n \n \n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n   \n \n \n \n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n  \n \n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n  \n \n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing."}
{"id":"SIGNAL_RED_5","contents":"A tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n  \n \n  \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\n  \n \n  Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n  \n \n  \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\n  \n \n  Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Stardust's\n   \n  mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\n  \n \n  Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\n  \n \n  The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\n  \n \n  The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and thought."}

The guts\nof the space ship.\n  \n \n  Then he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing from\na fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still working\naway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-down\npins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at his\nhands, and shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"One try,\" he said to himself. \"One try, Shano. One important thing in\nyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you.

Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they drop\noff, lift them up again.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked back\nsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, \"Pop, pop,\" behind him and\nmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Another\njerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, and\nlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blank\nthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,\nthe way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, then\nlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shooting\npain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard the\nhigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinery\ngo. He was running the cosmic drive.\n  \n \n  A bell clanged somewhere. \"Engine room! Engine room!

Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling the\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  toward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet.\nIf he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. After\nthat....\n  \n \n  \"Home,\" he coughed. \"Hell! Who wants to go home?\"\n  \n \n  He plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranian\nfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippled\nship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.\nA useless old man.\n  \n \n  Coughing came out all mixed up with laughing."}

By eight o'clock a wet, heavy,\nsnow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were\nall down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee\nand remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It\nwas well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed\nin a field near the settlement.\n  \n \n  There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the\ncolonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore\ngrumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had\nconvenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but\nno one went out to greet them.\n  \n \n  After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship\nand stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained\nthere, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly\nthing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or\njust plain orneriness.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I never,\" a nice lady said.\n  \n \n  \"What's he just\n   \n   standing\n   \n  there for?\" another lady said.\n  \n \n  And all of them thought: well, God knows what's in the mind of a\nsoldier, and right away many people concluded that he must be drunk.\nThe seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children\nand the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so\ncarefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally,\nto despise soldiers.\n  \n \n  The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind."}

And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly.

The rest, including some women and children,\nwere missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,\neven books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were\nthe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n  \n \n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n  \n \n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n  \n \n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n  \n \n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of\nthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died\nin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those\nships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a\nsociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only\ndefense Earth had.\n  \n \n  This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth\nwith a bottle on his hip."}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_4","contents":"An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven\nface, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and\nlistened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists\nwere beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great\nsuddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait,\nbetween acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.\n  \n \n  Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those\nin the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan\ngrinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake\nit and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly\nand inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and\nimpregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set\nup automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever\nhaving lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home\nout of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But\nat least this was better than the wailing of the cities.\n  \n \n  This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all\nby any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an\noutcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing.\nHe stirred restlessly.\n  \n \n  By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much\nto say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: \"Lupus,\nLupus\u2014doesn't that mean wolves or something?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very\npossible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for\ndiscussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the\nhell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.\n  \n \n  But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of\nwomen began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their\nanger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and\nconfronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.\n  \n \n  \"See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our\n   \n   home\n   \n  . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been\npaying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you\nearned your keep. We demand....\"\n  \n \n  It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped\nthat he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him\nnow and giving him that name of ancient contempt, \"soldier boy.\" The\ngloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.\n  \n \n  \"There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that\nwere obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for\nthe brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.\""}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_5","contents":"Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted\nthe army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was\nnot the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be\ncoming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had\nrealized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history\nof Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble\ndream, it was ended now and it was time to move.\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get going,\" he finally said, and there was quiet.\n\"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of\nthis system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed\nto have you gone by then.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and\nthe rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two\nstopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man\nsaid he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off\nhis planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to\ncheck the bomb, grateful for the action.\n  \n \n  Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the\nradio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the\nwire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and\nit felt fine.\n  \n \n  Dylan had been called up out of a bar\u2014he and Bossio\u2014and told what had\nhappened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This\nwould be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him.\nAfter thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk,\na man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like\nthat. It would take time.\n  \n \n  He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.\n  \n \n  Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain.\nWell, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty\nyears he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way\nalong the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled\nand got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot\nof ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and\nhe had done them all.\n  \n \n  Once he had even studied military tactics.\n  \n \n  He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green.\nBut he'd been only nineteen when his father died\u2014of a hernia, of a\ncrazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked\ntoo long on a heavy planet\u2014and in those days the anti-war conditioning\nout on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians\nof the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down\ndoctor. And ... now he was a captain.\n  \n \n  He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait\nand the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days\nwas upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell\nwith it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of\nthe bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults\nwhich are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the\ncore of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point:\nit made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed\nnobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something\npleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.\n  \n \n  Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it\nthrew him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire\nhad just been cut."}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_6","contents":"Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n  \n \n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n  \n \n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n  \n \n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n  \n \n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n  \n \n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n  \n \n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n  \n \n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\""}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_7","contents":"It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was\nsilent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,\n\"Maybe an animal?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or\nfound it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?\nThe wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one\nis cut too\u2014newly cut.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.\n  \n \n  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that\na bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that\nsomething didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the\ncenter of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then\nwalked right out again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"\n  \n \n  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them.\nI'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"\n  \n \n  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his\nhands.\n  \n \n  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that\nhe'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was\nperhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.\n  \n \n  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?\nTelepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?\n  \n \n  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there\nwould be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really\nknow.\n  \n \n  Were they small? Little animals?\n  \n \n  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable\nbrain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large\nas a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long\nbefore a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly\nshown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.\n  \n \n  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.\n  \n \n  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he\nstraightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out\nhis pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last\ntime he had fired it. He never had\u2014he never had fired a gun."}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_8","contents":"The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\""}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_9","contents":"Dylan swung slowly to look at him. \"As far as I can figure, an alien\ncut it.\"\n  \n \n  Rush shook his head. \"No. Ain't been no aliens near this camp, and\nno peculiar animals either. We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no\nunidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year\nago.\" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. \"Uh-uh. One of\nus did it.\"\n  \n \n  The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet.\n  \n \n  \"Telepathy?\" asked Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"Might be.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if\none of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?\"\n  \n \n  Rush calmly\u2014at least outwardly calmly\u2014lit his pipe. There was a\nstrength in this man that Dylan had missed before.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know,\" he said gruffly. \"But these are aliens, mister. And until\nI know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.\"\n  \n \n  He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.\n  \n \n  Then Rossel jumped. \"My God!\"\n  \n \n  Dylan moved to quiet him. \"Look, is there any animal at all that ever\ncomes near here that's as large as a dog?\"\n  \n \n  After a pause, Rush answered. \"Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like\na reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we\nlanded. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.\" He rose slowly,\nthe rifle held under his arm. \"I b'lieve we might just as well go post\nthem sentries.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to\nsay. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained\nexpression on his face, to put through that call to Three.\n  \n \n  When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, \"Where you want them sentries? I got\nWalt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow.\n\"You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises,\nwithin calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five\nminutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.\"\n  \n \n  The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. \"Nice day for\nhuntin',\" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering\nhis footprints."}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_10","contents":"The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide\nwarm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae;\ncuriously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans\ncome. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He\nsaw that they were armed.\n  \n \n \n \n  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced\nlizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been\nwatching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware\nof their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.\n  \n \n  That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that\nnight and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But\n   \n   flexibility\n   \n  , he reminded himself sternly,\n   \n   is the first principle of\nabsorption\n   \n  , and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection\nreached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the\nhour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer\ntold him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and\nthat the attack there had probably begun.\n  \n \n  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay\nquietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow,\nthanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he\nwould not have to venture out into that miserable cold.\n  \n \n  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with\nuncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was\ndistinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could\ntake no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single\nbutton, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling\nof the colonists' ship."}
{"id":"SOLDIER_BOY_11","contents":"When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow,\nthinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later\nthe realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three\nhad never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard\nthe signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was\nall they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered.\nThere was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He\nchecked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the\nair was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.\n  \n \n  Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what\nhe felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said\nhopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the\nmen in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and\nhe was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what\nwould have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But\neven stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he\nrealized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then\nthat he thought of Bossio.\n  \n \n  Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three\nwas dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was\ngone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow.\nMore than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken,\nunalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead\u2014the one\nthing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had.\nIn all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his\nfriendship and his trust.\n  \n \n  He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the\npeople were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were\nbeginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him\nwith hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.\n  \n \n  Bossio\u2014a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no\ngrudges\u2014Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried\nto help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days\nof his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and\ndie to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four\nhours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company.

If peace leads to no\nconflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be\nlearned. So he could not hate these people.\n  \n \n  But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went\ninto the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might\nbe leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see\nthe fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and\ntried, for the last time, to call Bossio.\n  \n \n  After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was\na very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and\nhe was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he\nmust be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a\nmackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.\n  \n \n  They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of\neveryone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like\nthat, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the\ncoffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the\nship.\n  \n \n  It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see\na great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes.\nThen he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the\nweight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some\nof the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and\nwere still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went\nautomatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The\nelders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep\nthemselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.\n  \n \n  In the end, the ship took forty-six people.\n  \n \n  Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him\nstanding by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried\nin her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected,\nrose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went\nslipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never\nunderstood before, because he had never once been among men in great\ntrouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while\nthere was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and\nthe airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp\nburning smell\u2014she couldn't get off the ground."}

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia.

Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life.

{"id":"SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_2","contents":"The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\ntypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\nAcademician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\nwho still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\nhaving his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\neyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n  \n \n  That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\nGirard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\nGubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\ncourage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\nthe Ultrawelfare State.\n  \n \n  Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\nLofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\nbright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\nthe cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\nmiserably failed.\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\nIn his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\nPond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\nbeen trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't two\nmen in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing our\ndelving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\nus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\nroad to his destiny.\"\n  \n \n  His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\ntraining forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers\nthroughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\nforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\nlack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\nadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\nancestors did?\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\nand tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\npresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's\nway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with\nthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous\npastimes.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap\nrebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\nreality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more\nthan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\nUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\nsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\nsociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\nclothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\nof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\ninto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\npopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\ndossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\nyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\nthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\ntrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\nlife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\nvery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\nHe was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\nof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\nmade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\ndrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\nfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\nour pleas for a few more trips?\"\n  \n \n  \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\""}
{"id":"SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_3","contents":"Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\nseemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\nthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\nman.\n  \n \n  He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\nalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\nactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\nthe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one\nneed face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the\nfact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n  \n \n  His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's\nleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the\npoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\ntake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\npilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\nexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\nincreasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in\n   \n   our\n   \n  minds, Hans, we are\nnear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\nspark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\nhold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\nto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be\nthat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\non Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\nExploration.\"\n  \n \n  \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n  \n \n  \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\nLooking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\nface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\njustify the means?\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin blinked at him.\n  \n \n  The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\nfailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read\nof the sailor and his way of life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\ndo with it?\"\n  \n \n  \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\nthan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\ntendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\nheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\nbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\nsea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\nfor years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talk\nof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\none short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\nheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\nwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\njail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\ncan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd\npersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\nthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n  \n \n  He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\nuniversal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\nnobody can, ah,\n   \n   con\n   \n  you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\nour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n  \n \n  The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\nmethods, my dear chap.\""}
{"id":"SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_4","contents":"II\n  \n \n  Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\nexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\nof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't\nbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his\nname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n  \n \n  When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\nwere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\nthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\nfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\ntaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\nthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\nhad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\ntake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n  \n \n  Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\na bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\ndangers met and passed.\n  \n \n  Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\nhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor\nneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n  \n \n  He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't\nany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the\nreputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\nfellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\nnot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did\nyou need?\n  \n \n  It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n  \n \n  In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\nin adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\nThey had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\nworking hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\nIt finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\nbut two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\nbecame obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\nthirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\nto have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\nof them ever really becoming efficient.\n  \n \n  The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\nunemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\nunemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\nreasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\nand a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\nwere needed, a draft lottery was held.\n  \n \n  All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\nwere drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\nmight feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\ngranted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\nthey fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\ndividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\nsold for a lump sum on the market.\n  \n \n  Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\nvacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\nof his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\nobviously called for.\n  \n \n  He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd\naccumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\nto blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\nwas burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\nwasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n  \n \n  Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\nfell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\nrate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the\nclassiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\nall the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n  \n \n  Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\ncenturies since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\nthe tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's\nprofits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\nquite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\nmust leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\nusually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\nhurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\ndenied him.\n  \n \n  Si was going to do it differently this time.\n  \n \n  Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\nworks. But nothing but the best."}
{"id":"SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_5","contents":"To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\nretirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\nattached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\nA bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In\nthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\nperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't\nneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\ntitles.\n  \n \n  Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\ncard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\nauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\nscreen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n  \n \n  In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\nInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\nthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\napiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\nscreen went dead.\n  \n \n  One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\nspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\nwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\nwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n  \n \n  He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\ntwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\nthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\nplace really made sense. The big city.\n  \n \n  He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\nand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\nmight as well do it up brown.\n  \n \n  He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\ncar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\ncontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\ndestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on\nthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\nhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\ngossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n  \n \n  The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\nshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\nrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\ndirection of the pressure was reversed.\n  \n \n  Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\nsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\ncanopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n  \n \n  A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\nyour credit card within ten minutes.\"\n  \n \n  Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\nswank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\nthe guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\nthe full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\nEmpire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\nthe all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n  \n \n  He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\ntable, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\nhe well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine\nor do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\nmanaged to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n  \n \n  He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\nhimself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness\nhe presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\ndirection so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\nmattress.\n  \n \n  He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\nfell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\nagainst the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\nregistration could be completed.\n  \n \n  For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\neasy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\naround in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\nThis time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\nthe grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n  \n \n  He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\nat the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\ndime a dozen.\n  \n \n  He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\n\"Kudos Room.\"\n  \n \n  The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\""}
{"id":"SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_6","contents":"At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\nmoment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.\nHowever, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\ngoing to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\nhis way to the bar.\n  \n \n  There was actually a bartender.\n  \n \n  Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\nair of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\nthey had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\nHe put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\ndrink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\nas to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n  \n \n  Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd\ndreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\nconning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\nto his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\ntake a look at the others present.\n  \n \n  To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\nthat he placed, at least\u2014top teevee stars, top politicians of the\nUltrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n  \n \n  He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\nwho occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\nand then swallowed.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Zo-ro-as-ter\n   \n  ,\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\nhaving cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\neyes. Every pore, but\n   \n   every\n   \n  pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\ngrace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n  \n \n  His stare couldn't be ignored.\n  \n \n  She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\nOut Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\nKudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\nbuilding the drink.\n  \n \n  Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\non me?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\nOriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n  \n \n  The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n  \n \n  The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a\nspace pin?\"\n  \n \n  Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you\nbeen on at least a Moon run.\"\n  \n \n  She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\n\"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\nSi,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n  \n \n  She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\nSeymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything\nlike this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\ncurrent sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\n\"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to\nif they say Seymour.\"\n  \n \n  \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\nsuch that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having\nmet him.\n  \n \n  Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\nbored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\nhim in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Academician\n   \n  Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\n   \n   Doc\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have\nmuch time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\nthat. But how come you cried?\""}

The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\nlaboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\nspawning its first-born.\n  \n \n  For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\nof the U.

{"id":"Spacemen_Die_at_Home_2","contents":"Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't\nsee 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n  \n \n  I blinked. \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"My folks.\"\n  \n \n  That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in\na strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\n\"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie\nTaggart.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\nveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\nago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\n   \n   Lunar\nLady\n   \n  , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\nSands.\n  \n \n  I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island\nSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like\nme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\nremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n  \n \n  My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It\nwasn't surprising. The\n   \n   Lunar Lady\n   \n  was in White Sands now, but\nliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\n  \n \n \n   It doesn't matter\n   \n  , I told myself.\n  \n \n  Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n  \n \n  Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\ngarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\ntenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\nhe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at\nthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was\nmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\nhalf as big.\n  \n \n  And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\nwere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\nthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\nlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\nthe sons of Earth.\n  \n \n \n   They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\ncivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\na hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\n   \n \n \n  I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared."}
{"id":"Spacemen_Die_at_Home_3","contents":"At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\nbabbling wave.\n  \n \n  Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n  \n \n  His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\nlike a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\nrows.\n  \n \n  But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and\nold, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\nit was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n  \n \n  He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n  \n \n  \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate\ntonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as\ngood spacemen should!\"\n  \n \n  Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\nwalking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\nwith some silent melody.\n  \n \n  And you, Laura, were with him.\n  \n \n  \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n  \n \n  I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\nof your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\ngolden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\nof a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\ngentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n  \n \n  \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for\nthe past year.\"\n  \n \n  A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\nintroduction of Charlie.\n  \n \n  You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\nStardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\nscorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\nshiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.\nHis tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n  \n \n  And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\nresult of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\naccustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\nknew, would find them ugly.\n  \n \n  You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to\nmeet you, Charlie. Just think\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first\nto reach the Moon!\"\n  \n \n  Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the\nweekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're\nplanning to see the town tonight.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their\nown plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.\nCharlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\nMoon?\"\n  \n \n  Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\nthat he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\nfizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n  \n \n  But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n  \n \n  \"We'd really like to come,\" I said."}

{"id":"Spacemen_Die_at_Home_5","contents":"I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\nThey were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\ndeep-rooted, belonging to Earth.

I knew\nsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n  \n \n  There was silence.\n  \n \n  You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\nflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\nfeeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n  \n \n  You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,\nLaura?\"\n  \n \n  You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be\nthinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I could never hate you.\"\n  \n \n  \"It\u2014it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you\nwant to go to them.

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n  \n \n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_2","contents":"He turned to the port to stare out at the planet. The Sol-type sun\nmust be rising, since there was a dim light. But the thick clouds that\nwrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change,\nit wasn't raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls of\nfog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forest\nglowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feeding\nanimals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even the\ndeep gorge where they'd found Hennessy's carefully buried ship was\ncompletely hidden by the fog.\n  \n \n  There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animals\nnow, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute,\ntrying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them....\n  \n \n  But there was no time.\n  \n \n  Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load of\ndeep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any sign\nof Hennessy. He'd been here a week longer than he should have stayed\nalready. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happened\nto the men who'd deserted their ship and its equipment, he'd have to\nreport back.\n  \n \n  He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn't exposed enough\nof the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air by\nluck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectors\noriginally.\n  \n \n  \"Bob!\" Jane Corey's voice cut through his pondering. \"Bob, there are\nthe kids!\"\n  \n \n  Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caught\nhis eye.\n  \n \n  The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantastic\nspeed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something that\nmoved there.\n  \n \n  He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, just\nbeyond the movement he'd seen through the mist.\n  \n \n  Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground.\nSomething began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, but\nGwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets.\n  \n \n  They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them.\nYoung Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together.\n  \n \n  Then the mists cleared.\n  \n \n  Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets.\nShaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almost\neight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuited\ncadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was a\nmomentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning the\nothers forward."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_3","contents":"\"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of\nthe little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was\nagonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\nback at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\nconfusion. But someone was taking over now\u2014one of the crew women. The\njeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\nGwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\n  \n \n  There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\nirritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\nthe seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\njeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\nup speed. The other two followed.\n  \n \n  There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\nsurrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\nhorrible in a travesty of manhood.\n  \n \n  The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\nracing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\nabout, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\nmiles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\nspite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\ndownward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\n  \n \n  \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to\nleave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\nkids. But it was too late to go back.\n  \n \n  The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\na gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\nhad to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\n  \n \n  Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\ntrail to confuse the pursuers.\n  \n \n  There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\nglimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\nfaces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\nwindshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\nsteering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\n  \n \n  The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\nother jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\nto help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\nthe horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\n  \n \n  A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\n  \n \n  He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\nseemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\nagainst the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\nleader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\nshoulder.\n  \n \n  The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\nleaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\nfor the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_4","contents":"The arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distorted\nshoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\nhands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\nnose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\nthe captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\nsound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\nfurther move, though it was still breathing.\n  \n \n  Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\nwas either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\nkick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\nonto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\non another before heading back.\n  \n \n  \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\nhis own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live\u2014and you're\ndetailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\nlanguage or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\nand why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\nanswer.\"\n  \n \n  Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien\nmetabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat\nsickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\nmakes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\nno sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\n  \n \n  \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\nanything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying\nour time here already.\"\n  \n \n  The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been\npicked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\nbusy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\nas he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\ninformative with retelling.\n  \n \n  If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\ntime and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That\nwas almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\nto be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had\nbeen overcome by the aliens.\n  \n \n  It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\nprimitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its\nfuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\nthese creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a\nlittle more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship\ncunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\n  \n \n  Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\nsomething\u2014and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\nremotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_5","contents":"The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\ninto a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\nprevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\na drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life\nthere to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\n  \n \n  But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\nfinally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\n  \n \n  It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go\u2014but it would\nrender the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\nman had to colonize.\n  \n \n  And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\nexplorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\nterraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\nbegan filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\nspace.\n  \n \n  Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\nfour more months back.\n  \n \n  In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\nfootholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems.

If not, as\nit now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\n  \n \n  Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\nstrip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\n  \n \n  But how could primitives do what these must have done?\n  \n \n  He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\ncemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\nlaminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\nhand had been able to do for centuries.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\nsee a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\n  \n \n  He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\nsquatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\nThey were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\nFor the return of their leader\u2014or for something that would give the\nship to them?\n  \n \n  Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\"\n  \n \n  Barker's voice sounded odd.\n  \n \n  \"Physically fine. You can see him. But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\nat Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\nchecking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\n  \n \n  There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\nsound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker\nseemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\n  \n \n  The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\nthick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\nsome kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\nunerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.\n  \n \n  \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_6","contents":"\"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\nBarker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was\ntaut with strain.\n  \n \n  The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\nits head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\n  \n \n  \"He never meant to hurt the kids\u2014just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\nquickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very\nwell. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds\nfit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\ngets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n  \n \n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have? How many were brown?\"\n  \n \n  The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\ncuriously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\nspread out.\n  \n \n  Three. Seven. Zero.\n  \n \n  The answers were right.\n  \n \n  By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\ntwisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\nlong time telling.\n  \n \n  When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\nsilence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\npossible, Doc?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\nby what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under\nthe microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about\ntheir kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be\na hereditary change\u2014the things that affect the body don't change the\ngerm plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\nthe fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\ndown to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\nmonsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\ntall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\n  \n \n  The kids of the exploring party...."}
{"id":"Spawning_Ground_7","contents":"Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,\nset the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgle\nas the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto the\nground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to the\nship again.\n  \n \n  He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd had\ntime to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,\nhowever much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting off\ngiving the gist of it to Jane.\n  \n \n  \"It was the blobs,\" he summarized it. \"They seem to be amused by men.\nThey don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessy\ndoesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,\nall life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.\n  \n \n  \"And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside the\nhull. It doesn't show yet\u2014but we're changed. In another month, Earth\nfood would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeper\nthis time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colony\nwhere three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll never\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Nobody would know. Their children\u2014odd children who matured in eight\nyears\u2014would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earth\ntools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.\nNothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the new\neyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.\n  \n \n  She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what must\nnow be her home. Then she sighed. \"You'll need practice, but the others\ndon't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'll\nbelieve it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really been\nchanged yet, have we?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. \"No.\nThey have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was only\npuzzlement in her face. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her the\nsame answer he had found for himself. \"The spawning ground!\"\n  \n \n  It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant her\nseed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preserve\nthat seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already were\nbecoming uncertain.\n  \n \n  Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead of\nmen having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strange\nchildren of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek back\nto civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhaps\nsome of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next\nrise to culture a better one.\n  \n \n  \"We're needed here,\" he told her, his voice pleading for the\nunderstanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. \"These people need\nas rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.\nThe fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them with\na decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe or\naccept the idea\u2014or even let us come back. We have to stay here.\"\n  \n \n  She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. \"Be\nfruitful,\" she whispered. \"Be fruitful and spawn and replenish an\nearth.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he told her. \"Replenish the stars.\"\n  \n \n  But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.\n  \n \n  Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanes\nagain, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, they\ncould adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead them\nthrough all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyond\nnumbering.\n  \n \n  Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for the\nchildren of men!"}

Nine years after the great\nbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this\ntiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain\nher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.\n  \n \n  The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact.

Ignoring the pain and pulling on\nthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly\nto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve\nof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring\nthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she\nwas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the\ncubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling\nfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle\nto come would be her apparent harmlessness.\n  \n \n  Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born\nScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that\nof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black\nstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had\nsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.\n  \n \n  The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and\nevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:\nShould he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two\nmonths since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.\nYes, he would shoot.\n  \n \n  Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,\nhoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With\nsatisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind\nof the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up\nbehind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.\nHe had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,\nhe would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.\nWomen auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.\n  \n \n  Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved\nfaster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in\nthe mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He\nwas not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly\nonward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,\nthinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards\nin this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and\nthe dull light in his brain went out.\n  \n \n \n \n   She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.\n   \n \n \n \n  Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from\nbehind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.\nFor I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite\neffective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped\nthe odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam\npower down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While\nhe bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the\nbeam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at\nleast, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of\na woman.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.\n  \n \n  \"Name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Evelyn Kane.\"\n  \n \n  The eyes of the inquisitor widened. \"So you admit to a Terran name.\nWell, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply\nlorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry\ncorporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,\nwhere is the corporal? Did you kill him?\"\n  \n \n  He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have\nthe guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a\nway, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran\nclass. No\u2014he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford\nanother woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with\nthis cool murderess.\n  \n \n  \"Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the\ncorporal?\" He leaned impatiently over his desk.\n  \n \n  The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The\nguards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was\ntheir custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.\n  \n \n  She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the\ninquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.\n  \n \n  \"If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the\nguards out for a few minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on her hip. \"I\nhave interesting information.\"\n  \n \n  So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he\ncould take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the\nguards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one\nanother.\n  \n \n  Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib\ngingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He\nwould certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut\nshort with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind\ngreater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the\nrecorder.\n  \n \n  \"Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,\" she asked\ntersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.\n  \n \n  \"Perat, Viscount of Tharn,\" replied the man mechanically.\n  \n \n  \"What is the extent of his jurisdiction?\"\n  \n \n  \"From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles\nradius.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for\npassage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.\"\n  \n \n  The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a\nseal at its bottom.\n  \n \n  \"You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:\n'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'\"\n  \n \n  The man's pen scratched away obediently.\n  \n \n  Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.\nShe took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.\n\"Call the guards,\" she ordered.\n  \n \n  He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.\n  \n \n  \"This person is no longer a prisoner,\" said the inquisitor woodenly.\n\"She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of\nZone One.\"\n  \n \n  When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any\nmemory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the\nrecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,\nand sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for\nauditing."}
{"id":"Stalemate_In_Space_3","contents":"Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended\nfrom the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly\nbe high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a\nsimilar ability in a mere clerk.\n  \n \n  Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings\nwere still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either\nshot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of\nradiation-remover was everywhere.\n  \n \n  She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.\n  \n \n  \"What is that?\" she asked the transport attendant.\n  \n \n  \"The Commandant is shooting prisoners,\" he replied laconically.\n  \n \n  \"Oh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where did you want to go?\"\n  \n \n  \"To the personnel office.\"\n  \n \n  \"That way.\" He pointed to the largest building of the group\u2014two\nstories high, reasonably intact.\n  \n \n  She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there\nwith dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and\nwas admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed\nher stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene\ncoughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.\n  \n \n  A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered\nsomething to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.\n  \n \n  In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn\nfrowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under\ncertain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.\n  \n \n  The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some\nsort, who was studying her visa.\n  \n \n  \"I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria\u2014ah\u2014\"\u2014he looked at the visa\nsuspiciously\u2014\"S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to\nS'ria Gerek, here\"\u2014he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back\u2014\"I\nwish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether\nthey want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to\nH.Q.?\"\n  \n \n  She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given\nsome answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It\nwould have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in\nhis eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had\ncombed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring\nthe narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided\nyellow hair. He was studying her covertly.\n  \n \n  \"The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,\" she said\nsimply. \"I was told that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , that is, I mean\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate\nloudly into her mechanical transcriber.\n  \n \n  Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,\nmanaged a delicate flush. \"I meant to say, I thought I would be happier\nworking for\u2014working here. So I asked for a transfer.\"\n  \n \n  S'ria Gorph beamed. \"Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,\nyou know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we\ncut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\"\u2014winking\nartfully\u2014\"and I'll see that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and\nanxiety. He appeared to listen.\n  \n \n  Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was\ncertain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The\nchances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length\nof time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all\npossible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen\npersonal secretaries and\/or concubines and would take small interest in\nthe lowly employees that amused Gorph.\n  \n \n  Gorph looked at her uncertainly. \"Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,\nsends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.\" He\npointed to a hallway. \"All the way through there, across to the other\nwing.\"\n  \n \n  As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and\ncalculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could\nfeel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that\nthe Faeg had ceased firing."}
{"id":"Stalemate_In_Space_4","contents":"Her heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt a\nvery strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild\ninterest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers\nin the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception\nof Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he\nwould let her dance for him.\n  \n \n  The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed\na sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath\nfor long. Perat was merely amused at her \"lie\" to his under-supervisor.\nHe had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false\nmemories.\n  \n \n  She opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on the\nbalustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence.\n  \n \n  The five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as were\nmost of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could be\nseen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner\nof his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his\nabdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely\ncut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings\u2014apparently\nidentical\u2014on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness\nand unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an\nunnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic\nof a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel\npleasures.\n  \n \n  In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her\nappraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe\nwas there awaiting it.\n  \n \n  \"You are right,\" he said coldly, still staring into the court below.\n\"Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.\"\n  \n \n  He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. \"Take this.\"\n  \n \n  He had not as yet looked at her.\n  \n \n  She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered\nher and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly\ntwenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.\n  \n \n  Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank\u2014was left standing.\nHis arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the\nkiller above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their\neyes met, and he started imperceptibly.\n  \n \n  Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was\nwhite, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could\nbe no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.\n  \n \n  Her father.\n  \n \n  The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment\nthat she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream.\nA dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his\neyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read\nbedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.\n  \n \n  An icy, amused voice came through: \"Our orders are to kill all\nprisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It\nwarms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.\"\n  \n \n  Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was\nexplaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because\nall captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own\nmen, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not\nrelegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his\nunderlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of\nthat contempt. His next words did not surprise her.\n  \n \n  \"It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill\nthem. You are shuddering you know?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat dropped\nfrom it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill the\nCommandant and save her father for a little while. But then the\nproblem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved\nmore quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the\ncontrary if she could get him interested in her\u2014\n  \n \n  \"So far as our records indicate,\" murmured Perat, \"the man down there\nis the last living Terran within\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  . It occurred to me that\nour newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The\nFaeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's\neyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other\nnights\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted\nthe ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully,\nwithout expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.\n  \n \n  Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised\nthe gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed\nthe trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran\nofficer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground,\nface up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.\n  \n \n  The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first\nwith amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Come here,\" he ordered.\n  \n \n  The Faeg dropped from her hand. With a titanic effort she activated her\nlegs and walked toward him.\n  \n \n  He was studying her face very carefully.\n  \n \n  She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that she\nhad to lean on the coping.\n  \n \n  With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung\nover her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the\nmentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created\nfor her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be\nthinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar\ncompletely.\n  \n \n  He dropped his hand. \"I'm sorry,\" he said with a quiet weariness. \"I\nshouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.\"\nThen: \"Have you ever seen me before?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you have a son?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back,\nsurveying the courtyard and the dead. \"Gorph will be wondering what\nhappened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.\"\n  \n \n  Apparently he suspected nothing.\n  \n \n \n   Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.\n   \n \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Perat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple\n   \n   terif\n   \n  and following the\nthinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floated\nfrom his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's club\nsomewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly on\ntiptoe.\n  \n \n  For the last thirty \"nights\"\u2014the hours allotted to rest and sleep\u2014it\nhad been thus. By \"day\" she probed furtively into the minds of the\noffice staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official\nmessages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews.\nBy night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, nor\nhis probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult to\nelude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blotted\nout memory and knowledge.\n  \n \n  \"Enough for now,\" he ordered. \"Careful of your rib.\"\n  \n \n  When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first\nnight, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed\nfloor, and of falling.\n  \n \n  Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own\ncouch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel\nof metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur\nstereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been\ninstalled in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them\nwaited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some\ntwo feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a\nwoman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through\na luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.\n  \n \n  Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy\nwere complete strangers.\n   \n   But the woman\u2014!\n   \n \n \n  \"That is Phaen, my father,\" said Perat quietly. \"He stayed at home\nbecause he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on\nTharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general\nresemblance to the Tharn line.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\n   \n   can you deny that you are the woman\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.\n  \n \n  \"There seemed to be some similarity\u2014\" she admitted. Her throat was\nsuddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know\nthe woman.\n  \n \n  The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the\nroom, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling\nscowl.\n  \n \n  \"Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar\nidentical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!\"\n  \n \n  Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but\nher mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled\nin her plan for destruction. She\n   \n   must\n   \n  make it a known quantity.\n  \n \n  \"Did your father send it to you?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, of\ncourse.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did he say about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and\naccept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and\nthat\u2014well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all, except that he included this ring.\" He pulled one of the\nduplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.\n\"It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my\nmajority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of\nits kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak,\nbut I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?\"\n  \n \n  Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.\n  \n \n  \"Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?\" murmured Perat.\n\"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentient\nphase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old\ncount was right.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could be courtmartialed for that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight\u2014an appeal\nfrom a death sentence.\" He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and\npoured another glass of\n   \n   terif\n   \n  . \"Some fool inquisitor can't show\nproper disposition of a woman prisoner.\"\n  \n \n  Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. \"Indeed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him\nalone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who\ntries for a little extra profit.\"\n  \n \n  She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The\nstimulus would almost certainly make him remember.\n  \n \n  \"I'll wait for you,\" she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in\na languorous yawn.\n  \n \n  \"Very well.\" Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at\nher. \"On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and\nthe others have gone.\"\n  \n \n  Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you'd better come,\" insisted Perat.\n  \n \n  She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly,\nand then followed him out.\n  \n \n  This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of\nperfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.\n  \n \n  \"Odd smell,\" commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.\n  \n \n  \"Odd scent,\" corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about\nthe earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in\nthe use of the \"perfume.\" The adrenalin glands, they had explained,\nprovided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin\nslowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and blood\npressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But there\ncould be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they had\npointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly\nwith the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed\nover-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened\npersons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.\n  \n \n  The question remained\u2014who would be the more frightened, she or the\ncondemned inquisitor?\n  \n \n  She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was\nstanding stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered\nthe Zone Provost's chambers."}

Two more blasts, quickly\ntogether, and the sound of a\nscream faintly.\n  \n \n  Frowning, worrying about the\nsounds, Alan momentarily forgot\nto watch his step until his foot\nsuddenly plunged into an ant\nhill, throwing him to the jungle\nfloor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again,\nfor the tenth time, and stood\nuncertainly in the dimness.\nFrom tall, moss-shrouded trees,\nwrist-thick vines hung quietly,\nscraping the spongy ground like\nthe tentacles of some monstrous\ntree-bound octopus. Fitful little\nplants grew straggly in the\nshadows of the mossy trunks,\nforming a dense underbrush that\nmade walking difficult.

Two short, popping\nsounds echoed across the stillness,\ndrowned out almost immediately\nand silenced by an\nexplosive crash. Alan started,\n\"Blaster fighting!

He\ntried to run, but vines blocked\nhis way and woody shrubs\ncaught at his legs, tripping him\nand holding him back.

Alan froze. \"My God,\nPete built those things wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\nof claws and teeth hurled\nitself from the smoldering\nbranches and crashed against the\nrobot, clawing insanely at the\nantenna and blaster barrel.\nWith an awkward jerk the robot\nswung around and fired its blaster,\ncompletely dissolving the\nlower half of the cat creature\nwhich had clung across the barrel.\nBut the back pressure of the\ncat's body overloaded the discharge\ncircuits. The robot started\nto shake, then clicked sharply\nas an overload relay snapped\nand shorted the blaster cells.\nThe killer turned and rolled back\ntowards the camp, leaving Alan\nalone.\n  \n \n  Shakily, Alan crawled a few\nfeet back into the undergrowth\nwhere he could lie and watch the\ncamp, but not himself be seen.\nThough visibility didn't make\nany difference to the robots, he\nfelt safer, somehow, hidden. He\nknew now what the shooting\nsounds had been and why there\nhadn't been anyone around the\ncamp site. A charred blob lying\nin the grass of the clearing confirmed\nhis hypothesis. His stomach\nfelt sick.\n  \n \n  \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"that Pete assembled\nthese robots in a batch and then\nactivated them all at once, probably\nnever living to realize that\nthey're tuned to pick up human\nbrain waves, too. Damn!\nDamn!\" His eyes blurred and\nhe slammed his fist into the soft\nearth.\n  \n \n  When he raised his eyes again\nthe jungle was perceptibly darker.\nStealthy rustlings in the\nshadows grew louder with the\nsetting sun. Branches snapped\nunaccountably in the trees overhead\nand every now and then\nleaves or a twig fell softly to the\nground, close to where he lay.\nReaching into his jacket, Alan\nfingered his pocket blaster. He\npulled it out and held it in his\nright hand. \"This pop gun\nwouldn't even singe a robot, but\nit just might stop one of those\npumas.\"\n  \n \n  They said the blast with your name on it would find\nyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\n  \n \n  Slowly Alan looked around,\nsizing up his situation. Behind\nhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\nHe shuddered. \"Not a\nvery healthy spot to spend the\nnight. On the other hand, I certainly\ncan't get to the camp with\na pack of mind-activated mechanical\nkillers running around.\nIf I can just hold out until morning,\nwhen the big ship arrives ...\nThe big ship! Good\nLord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\noily sweat punctuated his forehead.\nPeggy, arriving tomorrow\nwith the other colonists, the\nwives and kids! The metal killers,\ntuned to blast any living\nflesh, would murder them the\ninstant they stepped from the\nship!\n  \n \n \n  A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\nhe'd married just three weeks\nago. He still couldn't believe it.\nIt was crazy, he supposed, to\nmarry a girl and then take off\nfor an unknown planet, with her\nto follow, to try to create a home\nin a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\nbut Peggy and her green eyes\nthat changed color with the\nlight, with her soft brown hair,\nand her happy smile, had ended\nthirty years of loneliness and\nhad, at last, given him a reason\nfor living. \"Not to be killed!\"\nAlan unclenched his fists and\nwiped his palms, bloody where\nhis fingernails had dug into the\nflesh.\n  \n \n  There was a slight creak above\nhim like the protesting of a\nbranch too heavily laden. Blaster\nready, Alan rolled over onto his\nback. In the movement, his elbow\nstruck the top of a small\nearthy mound and he was instantly\nengulfed in a swarm of\nlocust-like insects that beat disgustingly\nagainst his eyes and\nmouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\narms before his face he jumped\nup and backwards, away from\nthe bugs. As he did so, a dark\nshapeless thing plopped from\nthe trees onto the spot where he\nhad been lying stretched out.\nThen, like an ambient fungus,\nit slithered off into the jungle\nundergrowth.\n  \n \n  For a split second the jungle\nstood frozen in a brilliant blue\nflash, followed by the sharp report\nof a blaster. Then another.\nAlan whirled, startled. The\nplanet's double moon had risen\nand he could see a robot rolling\nslowly across the clearing in his\ngeneral direction, blasting indiscriminately\nat whatever mind\nimpulses came within its pickup\nrange, birds, insects, anything.\nSix or seven others also left the\ncamp headquarters area and\nheaded for the jungle, each to a\nslightly different spot.\n  \n \n  Apparently the robot hadn't\nsensed him yet, but Alan didn't\nknow what the effective range\nof its pickup devices was. He\nbegan to slide back into the\njungle. Minutes later, looking\nback he saw that the machine,\nthough several hundred yards\naway, had altered its course and\nwas now headed directly for\nhim.\n  \n \n  His stomach tightened. Panic.\nThe dank, musty smell of the\njungle seemed for an instant to\nthicken and choke in his throat.\nThen he thought of the big ship\nlanding in the morning, settling\ndown slowly after a lonely two-week\nvoyage. He thought of a\nbrown-haired girl crowding with\nthe others to the gangway, eager\nto embrace the new planet, and\nthe next instant a charred nothing,\nunrecognizable, the victim\nof a design error or a misplaced\nwire in a machine. \"I have to\ntry,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\ntry.\" He moved into the blackness.\n  \n \n  Powerful as a small tank, the\nkiller robot was equipped to\ncrush, slash, and burn its way\nthrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,\nit was slowed by the\nlarger trees and the thick, clinging\nvines, and Alan found that\nhe could manage to keep ahead\nof it, barely out of blaster range.\nOnly, the robot didn't get tired.\nAlan did.\n  \n \n  The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\nshadows that wavered\nand danced across the jungle\nfloor, hiding debris that tripped\nhim and often sent him sprawling\ninto the dark. Sharp-edged\ngrowths tore at his face and\nclothes, and insects attracted by\nthe blood matted against his\npants and shirt. Behind, the robot\ncrashed imperturbably after\nhim, lighting the night with fitful\nblaster flashes as some\nwinged or legged life came within\nits range.\n  \n \n  There was movement also, in\nthe darkness beside him, scrapings\nand rustlings and an occasional\nlow, throaty sound like an\nangry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\non his pocket blaster. Swift\nshadowy forms moved quickly in\nthe shrubs and the growling became\nsuddenly louder. He fired\ntwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\nSharp screams punctuated\nthe electric blue discharge as\na pack of small feline creatures\nleaped snarling and clawing\nback into the night.\n  \n \n \n  Mentally, Alan tried to figure\nthe charge remaining in his blaster.\nThere wouldn't be much.\n\"Enough for a few more shots,\nmaybe. Why the devil didn't I\nload in fresh cells this morning!\"\n  \n \n  The robot crashed on, louder\nnow, gaining on the tired human.\nLegs aching and bruised,\nstinging from insect bites, Alan\ntried to force himself to run\nholding his hands in front of\nhim like a child in the dark. His\nfoot tripped on a barely visible\ninsect hill and a winged swarm\nexploded around him. Startled,\nAlan jerked sideways, crashing\nhis head against a tree. He\nclutched at the bark for a second,\ndazed, then his knees\nbuckled. His blaster fell into the\nshadows.\n  \n \n  The robot crashed loudly behind\nhim now. Without stopping\nto think, Alan fumbled along the\nground after his gun, straining\nhis eyes in the darkness. He\nfound it just a couple of feet to\none side, against the base of a\nsmall bush. Just as his fingers\nclosed upon the barrel his other\nhand slipped into something\nsticky that splashed over his\nforearm. He screamed in pain\nand leaped back, trying frantically\nto wipe the clinging,\nburning blackness off his arm.\nPatches of black scraped off onto\nbranches and vines, but the rest\nspread slowly over his arm as\nagonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\nbeing ripped away layer by\nlayer.\n  \n \n  Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\nAlan stumbled forward.\nSharp muscle spasms shot from\nhis shoulder across his back and\nchest. Tears streamed across his\ncheeks.\n  \n \n  A blue arc slashed at the trees\na mere hundred yards behind.\nHe screamed at the blast. \"Damn\nyou, Pete! Damn your robots!\nDamn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\nHe stepped into emptiness.\n  \n \n  Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\nby the water, the pain began to\nfall away. He wanted to lie there\nforever in the dark, cool, wetness.\nFor ever, and ever, and ...\nThe air thundered.\n  \n \n  In the dim light he could see\nthe banks of the stream, higher\nthan a man, muddy and loose.\nGrowing right to the edge of the\nbanks, the jungle reached out\nwith hairy, disjointed arms as\nif to snag even the dirty little\nstream that passed so timidly\nthrough its domain.\n  \n \n  Alan, lying in the mud of the\nstream bed, felt the earth shake\nas the heavy little robot rolled\nslowly and inexorably towards\nhim. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\nhe thought, \"in battle\ndress.\" He tried to stand but his\nlegs were almost too weak and\nhis arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\nhim,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\nthe Lord High Executioner.\" He\nlaughed. Then his mind cleared.\nHe remembered where he was.\n  \n \n \n  Alan trembled. For the first\ntime in his life he understood\nwhat it was to live, because for\nthe first time he realized that he\nwould sometime die. In other\ntimes and circumstances he\nmight put it off for a while, for\nmonths or years, but eventually,\nas now, he would have to watch,\nstill and helpless, while death\ncame creeping. Then, at thirty,\nAlan became a man.\n  \n \n  \"Dammit, no law says I have\nto flame-out\n   \n   now\n   \n  !\" He forced\nhimself to rise, forced his legs\nto stand, struggling painfully in\nthe shin-deep ooze. He worked\nhis way to the bank and began to\ndig frenziedly, chest high, about\ntwo feet below the edge.\n  \n \n  His arm where the black thing\nhad been was swollen and tender,\nbut he forced his hands to dig,\ndig, dig, cursing and crying to\nhide the pain, and biting his\nlips, ignoring the salty taste of\nblood. The soft earth crumbled\nunder his hands until he had a\nsmall cave about three feet deep\nin the bank. Beyond that the\nsoil was held too tightly by the\nroots from above and he had to\nstop.\n  \n \n \n  The air crackled blue and a\ntree crashed heavily past Alan\ninto the stream. Above him on\nthe bank, silhouetting against\nthe moons, the killer robot stopped\nand its blaster swivelled\nslowly down. Frantically, Alan\nhugged the bank as a shaft of\npure electricity arced over him,\nsliced into the water, and exploded\nin a cloud of steam. The\nrobot shook for a second, its\nblaster muzzle lifted erratically\nand for an instant it seemed almost\nout of control, then it\nquieted and the muzzle again\npointed down.\n  \n \n  Pressing with all his might,\nAlan slid slowly along the bank\ninches at a time, away from the\nmachine above. Its muzzle turned\nto follow him but the edge of\nthe bank blocked its aim. Grinding\nforward a couple of feet,\nslightly overhanging the bank,\nthe robot fired again. For a split\nsecond Alan seemed engulfed in\nflame; the heat of hell singed his\nhead and back, and mud boiled\nin the bank by his arm.\n  \n \n  Again the robot trembled. It\njerked forward a foot and its\nblaster swung slightly away. But\nonly for a moment. Then the gun\nswung back again.\n  \n \n  Suddenly, as if sensing something\nwrong, its tracks slammed\ninto reverse. It stood poised for\na second, its treads spinning\ncrazily as the earth collapsed underneath\nit, where Alan had\ndug, then it fell with a heavy\nsplash into the mud, ten feet\nfrom where Alan stood.\n  \n \n  Without hesitation Alan\nthrew himself across the blaster\nhousing, frantically locking his\narms around the barrel as the\nrobot's treads churned furiously\nin the sticky mud, causing it to\nbuck and plunge like a Brahma\nbull. The treads stopped and the\nblaster jerked upwards wrenching\nAlan's arms, then slammed\ndown. Then the whole housing\nwhirled around and around, tilting\nalternately up and down like\na steel-skinned water monster\ntrying to dislodge a tenacious\ncrab, while Alan, arms and legs\nwrapped tightly around the blaster\nbarrel and housing, pressed\nfiercely against the robot's metal\nskin.\n  \n \n  Slowly, trying to anticipate\nand shift his weight with the\nspinning plunges, Alan worked\nhis hand down to his right hip.\nHe fumbled for the sheath clipped\nto his belt, found it, and extracted\na stubby hunting knife.\nSweat and blood in his eyes,\nhardly able to move on the wildly\nswinging turret, he felt down\nthe sides to the thin crack between\nthe revolving housing and\nthe stationary portion of the robot.\nWith a quick prayer he\njammed in the knife blade\u2014and\nwas whipped headlong into the\nmud as the turret literally snapped\nto a stop.\n  \n \n  The earth, jungle and moons\nspun in a pinwheeled blur,\nslowed, and settled to their proper\nplaces. Standing in the sticky,\nsweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\nthe robot apprehensively. Half\nburied in mud, it stood quiet in\nthe shadowy light except for an\noccasional, almost spasmodic\njerk of its blaster barrel. For\nthe first time that night Alan\nallowed himself a slight smile.\n\"A blade in the old gear box,\neh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n  \n \n  He turned. \"Well, I'd better\nget out of here before the knife\nslips or the monster cooks up\nsome more tricks with whatever\nit's got for a brain.\" Digging\nlittle footholds in the soft bank,\nhe climbed up and stood once\nagain in the rustling jungle\ndarkness.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\nPete could cram enough brain\ninto one of those things to make\nit hunt and track so perfectly.\"\nHe tried to visualize the computing\ncircuits needed for the\noperation of its tracking mechanism\nalone. \"There just isn't\nroom for the electronics. You'd\nneed a computer as big as the\none at camp headquarters.\"\n  \n \n \n  In the distance the sky blazed\nas a blaster roared in the jungle.\nThen Alan heard the approaching\nrobot, crunching and snapping\nits way through the undergrowth\nlike an onrushing forest\nfire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\nThey communicate with each\nother! The one I jammed must\nbe calling others to help.\"\n  \n \n  He began to move along the\nbank, away from the crashing\nsounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\neyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\nI'll bet anything they're\nautomatically controlled by the\ncamp computer. That's where\ntheir brain is!\" He paused.\n\"Then, if that were put out of\ncommission ...\" He jerked away\nfrom the bank and half ran, half\npulled himself through the undergrowth\ntowards the camp.\n  \n \n  Trees exploded to his left as\nanother robot fired in his direction,\ntoo far away to be effective\nbut churning towards him\nthrough the blackness.\n  \n \n  Alan changed direction slightly\nto follow a line between the\ntwo robots coming up from\neither side, behind him. His eyes\nwere well accustomed to the dark\nnow, and he managed to dodge\nmost of the shadowy vines and\nbranches before they could snag\nor trip him. Even so, he stumbled\nin the wiry underbrush and\nhis legs were a mass of stinging\nslashes from ankle to thigh.\n  \n \n  The crashing rumble of the\nkiller robots shook the night behind\nhim, nearer sometimes,\nthen falling slightly back, but\nfollowing constantly, more\nunshakable than bloodhounds\nbecause a man can sometimes cover\na scent, but no man can stop his\nthoughts. Intermittently, like\nphotographers' strobes, blue\nflashes would light the jungle\nabout him. Then, for seconds\nafterwards his eyes would see\ndancing streaks of yellow and\nsharp multi-colored pinwheels\nthat alternately shrunk and expanded\nas if in a surrealist's\nnightmare. Alan would have to\npause and squeeze his eyelids\ntight shut before he could see\nagain, and the robots would\nmove a little closer.\n  \n \n  To his right the trees silhouetted\nbriefly against brilliance as\na third robot slowly moved up\nin the distance. Without thinking,\nAlan turned slightly to the\nleft, then froze in momentary\npanic. \"I should be at the camp\nnow. Damn, what direction am\nI going?\" He tried to think\nback, to visualize the twists and\nturns he'd taken in the jungle.\n\"All I need is to get lost.\"\n  \n \n  He pictured the camp computer\nwith no one to stop it, automatically\nsending its robots in\nwider and wider forays, slowly\nwiping every trace of life from\nthe planet. Technologically advanced\nmachines doing the job\nfor which they were built, completely,\nthoroughly, without feeling,\nand without human masters\nto separate sense from futility.\nFinally parts would wear out,\ncircuits would short, and one by\none the killers would crunch to\na halt. A few birds would still\nfly then, but a unique animal\nlife, rare in the universe, would\nexist no more. And the bones of\nchildren, eager girls, and their\nmen would also lie, beside a\nrusty hulk, beneath the alien\nsun.\n  \n \n  \"Peggy!\"\n  \n \n  As if in answer, a tree beside\nhim breathed fire, then exploded.\nIn the brief flash of the\nblaster shot, Alan saw the steel\nglint of a robot only a hundred\nyards away, much nearer than\nhe had thought. \"Thank heaven\nfor trees!\" He stepped back, felt\nhis foot catch in something,\nclutched futilely at some leaves\nand fell heavily.\n  \n \n  Pain danced up his leg as he\ngrabbed his ankle. Quickly he\nfelt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\nthe rotten luck, anyway!\" He\nblinked the pain tears from his\neyes and looked up\u2014into a robot's\nblaster, jutting out of the\nfoliage, thirty yards away.\n  \n \n \n  Instinctively, in one motion\nAlan grabbed his pocket blaster\nand fired. To his amazement the\nrobot jerked back, its gun wobbled\nand started to tilt away.\nThen, getting itself under control,\nit swung back again to face\nAlan. He fired again, and again\nthe robot reacted. It seemed familiar\nsomehow. Then he remembered\nthe robot on the river\nbank, jiggling and swaying for\nseconds after each shot. \"Of\ncourse!\" He cursed himself for\nmissing the obvious. \"The blaster\nstatic blanks out radio\ntransmission from the computer\nfor a few seconds. They even do\nit to themselves!\"\n  \n \n  Firing intermittently, he\npulled himself upright and hobbled\nahead through the bush.\nThe robot shook spasmodically\nwith each shot, its gun tilted upward\nat an awkward angle.\n  \n \n  Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\nstars, real stars brilliant in the\nnight sky, and half dragging his\nswelling leg he stumbled out of\nthe jungle into the camp clearing.\nAhead, across fifty yards of\ngrass stood the headquarters\nbuilding, housing the robot-controlling\ncomputer. Still firing at\nshort intervals he started across\nthe clearing, gritting his teeth\nat every step.\n  \n \n  Straining every muscle in\nspite of the agonizing pain, Alan\nforced himself to a limping run\nacross the uneven ground, carefully\navoiding the insect hills\nthat jutted up through the grass.\nFrom the corner of his eye he\nsaw another of the robots standing\nshakily in the dark edge of\nthe jungle waiting, it seemed,\nfor his small blaster to run dry.\n  \n \n  \"Be damned! You can't win\nnow!\" Alan yelled between blaster\nshots, almost irrational from\nthe pain that ripped jaggedly\nthrough his leg. Then it happened.\nA few feet from the\nbuilding's door his blaster quit.\nA click. A faint hiss when he\nfrantically jerked the trigger\nagain and again, and the spent\ncells released themselves from\nthe device, falling in the grass\nat his feet. He dropped the useless\ngun.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" He threw himself on\nthe ground as a new robot suddenly\nappeared around the edge\nof the building a few feet away,\naimed, and fired. Air burned\nover Alan's back and ozone tingled\nin his nostrils.\n  \n \n  Blinding itself for a few seconds\nwith its own blaster static,\nthe robot paused momentarily,\njiggling in place. In this\ninstant, Alan jammed his hands\ninto an insect hill and hurled the\npile of dirt and insects directly\nat the robot's antenna. In a flash,\nhundreds of the winged things\nerupted angrily from the hole in\na swarming cloud, each part of\nwhich was a speck of life\ntransmitting mental energy to the\nrobot's pickup devices.\n  \n \n  Confused by the sudden dispersion\nof mind impulses, the\nrobot fired erratically as Alan\ncrouched and raced painfully for\nthe door. It fired again, closer,\nas he fumbled with the lock\nrelease. Jagged bits of plastic and\nstone ripped past him, torn loose\nby the blast.\n  \n \n  Frantically, Alan slammed\nopen the door as the robot, sensing\nhim strongly now, aimed\npoint blank. He saw nothing, his\nmind thought of nothing but the\nred-clad safety switch mounted\nbeside the computer. Time stopped.\nThere was nothing else in\nthe world. He half-jumped, half-fell\ntowards it, slowly, in tenths\nof seconds that seemed measured\nout in years.\n  \n \n  The universe went black.\n  \n \n  Later. Brilliance pressed upon\nhis eyes. Then pain returned, a\nmulti-hurting thing that crawled\nthrough his body and dragged\nragged tentacles across his\nbrain. He moaned.\n  \n \n  A voice spoke hollowly in the\ndistance. \"He's waking. Call his\nwife.\"\n  \n \n  Alan opened his eyes in a\nwhite room; a white light hung\nover his head. Beside him, looking\ndown with a rueful smile,\nstood a young man wearing\nspace medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\nhe acknowledged the question in\nAlan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\nThat was three days ago. When\nyou're up again we'd all like to\nthank you.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\ngreen-eyed girl was pressed\ntightly against him. Neither of\nthem spoke. They couldn't. There\nwas too much to say.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n October 1958.

A 40 credit tour is no substitute!\n   \n \n \n \n  The picture changed on the illuminated panel that filled the forward\nend of the shelf on which Michael lay. A haggard blonde woman sprawled\napathetically in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Rundown, nervous, hypertensive?\" inquired a mellifluous voice. \"In\nneed of mental therapy? Buy Grugis juice; it's not expensive. And they\nswear by it on Merop\u00e9.\"\n  \n \n  A disembodied pair of hands administered a spoonful of Grugis juice to\nthe woman, whereupon her hair turned bright yellow, makeup bloomed on\nher face, her clothes grew briefer, and she burst into a fast Callistan\nclog.\n  \n \n  \"I see from your hair that you have been a member of one of the\nBrotherhoods,\" the passenger lying next to Michael on the shelf\nremarked inquisitively. He was a middle-aged man, his dust-brown hair\nthinning on top, his small blue eyes glittering preternaturally from\nthe lenses fitted over his eyeballs.\n  \n \n  Michael rubbed his fingers ruefully over the blond stubble on his scalp\nand wished he had waited until his tonsure were fully grown before\nhe had ventured out into the world. But he had been so impatient to\nleave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the\nBrotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world\nthat had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal\nbehavior, \"I have been a Brother.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a\nBrotherhood?\" his shelf companion wanted to know. \"Trouble over a\nfemale?\"\n  \n \n  Michael shook his head, smiling. \"No, I have been a member of the\nAngeleno Brotherhood since I was an infant. My father brought me when\nhe entered.\"\n  \n \n  The other man clucked sympathetically. \"No doubt he was grieved over\nthe death of your mother.\"\n  \n \n  Michael closed his eyes to shut out the sight of a baby protruding its\nfat face at him three-dimensionally, but he could not shut out its\nlisping voice: \"Does your child refuse its food, grow wizened like a\nmonkey? It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" Michael replied. \"Father said that was one of the few\nblessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.\"\n  \n \n  Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. \"Be careful,\nyoung man!\" he warned. \"Lucky for you that you are talking to someone\nas broad-minded as I, but others aren't. You might be reported for\nviolating a tabu. An Earth tabu, moreover.\"\n  \n \n  \"An Earth tabu?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Motherhood is sacred here on Earth and so, of course, in\nthe entire United Universe. You should have known that.\""}
{"id":"Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_2","contents":"Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the\nLodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe\nso that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself,\nwith confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all\nthe customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all\nthe other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before\nthat wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing\nwith them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the\nsame laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no\ndifferences, and hence no wars.\n  \n \n  Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years\nthere had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and\nplenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar\nsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths\nof Aldebaran were still trying to add\n   \n   thought\n   \n  to the statute).\n  \n \n  Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any\nreason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to\nretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive\nforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had,\nperhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the\nworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's\nface upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the\npast\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal\nfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?\n  \n \n  The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged\nBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved\nyour majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why\ndon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\"\n  \n \n  Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying\nthe ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because\nhe had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his\npreparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence."}
{"id":"Tea_Tray_in_the_Sky_3","contents":"A large scarlet pencil jumped merrily across the advideo screen.

He had been dead for some time now, but\nthe dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face,\ntrickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop,\nfrom his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at\na queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow\nwhere his eyes had been.\n   \n \n \n \n   There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the\nblood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great\nbanks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would\nnever come to life again.\n   \n \n \n \n   I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as\nbefore: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not\nchanged, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold\nand alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like\nthe machinery, and like Peter.\n   \n \n \n \n   It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what\nPeter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,\neither. It was just an emptiness\u2014a void that could not be filled by\neating or drinking.\n   \n \n \n \n   It was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise\nthan they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for\nreason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\n   \n \n \n \n   But the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore.\nFor the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could\nnot solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within\nme, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly\u2014something moved on the skin of my\ncheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\n   \n \n \n \n   A tear was trickling down my cheek."}
{"id":"THE_AVENGER_2","contents":"Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\nsatisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud.

The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history.

They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly."}
{"id":"THE_AVENGER_3","contents":"It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\nlaboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\na halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\nmechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\nHe mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\nin the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\nfar enough to admit him.\n  \n \n  Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\non her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\nblonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n  \n \n  \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\nThen she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\nhours straight.

Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n  \n \n  She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\nwalked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\npapers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\nand pressed the stud.\n  \n \n  A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\nsuddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n  \n \n  Lorelei caught her breath.\n  \n \n  It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\nthe warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\ntransport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\nbeen dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\nyes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\ndisappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\nheartbeat they were gone.\n  \n \n  There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\ndefiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\nflesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\nmen and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\njoined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\nhelpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\nhorrible than any cry of agony.\n  \n \n  \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\nstrangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\nstreets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it."}
{"id":"THE_AVENGER_4","contents":"Lorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\n\"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides,\nand they know it; but they have to do it. This isn't like a war, where\nthe noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be\nany noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about\nthem, so that he can fight them\u2014and then it may not be enough.\"\n  \n \n  The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared\naway from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached\nout to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles\ntense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating\nup the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the\nrest.\n  \n \n  \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ...\nforty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted.\nThen they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone\nthrough the solid wall, or simply melted away.\n  \n \n  The man and woman clung together, waiting.\n  \n \n  There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and\nother faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man\nscreamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty\ngurgle and died, leaving silence again.\n  \n \n  Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms\nwere jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away\nfrom him and started toward the inner room.\n  \n \n  \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\n  \n \n  She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there!\n   \n   Peter!\n   \n  \" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\n  \n \n  There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been\ncleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down\nthe narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal\ncages, and paused just short of it.\n  \n \n  The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the\ndistorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his\nrange of vision."}
{"id":"THE_AVENGER_5","contents":"Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\nLorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\nbroad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\nglazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\nstraight ahead of him.\n  \n \n  The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\nIn a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\nparalyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n  \n \n  The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\nrelaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\nlegs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\ngrew gradually flatter.\n  \n \n  When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\npuddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n  \n \n  There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\nfear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\nin a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n  \n \n  The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\nbut there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n  \n \n  The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\nears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\nseemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\nwere lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\nthe eyes were alive.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\ntime he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\nswaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\nslowly....\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't\u2014Go back!\" The horrible,\nmindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\nHis insides writhed to thrust it out.\n  \n \n  She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\nfloor.\n  \n \n  The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\nit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\nfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\nthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead."}
{"id":"THE_AVENGER_6","contents":"Somebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n  \n \n  He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei\u2014\" but his mouth only\ntwitched feebly.

There was a blurred face before him;\nin a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\noddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\nstarched odor.\n  \n \n  \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\npressed him back into the sheets.\n  \n \n  \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n  \n \n  \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly.

He\nturned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n  \n \n  Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\nstand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\nmilky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n  \n \n  In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\nbefore he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't\u2014fool me. It's been\n   \n   more\n   \n  \u2014than three\u2014months.\"\n  \n \n  He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\nkept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\nout of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd\nbeen in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\nsooner.\n  \n \n  \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n\"Seeing that assistant of hers\u2014it was enough to knock anybody out,\nespecially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\n   \n   them\n   \n  for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know\u2014you talked a lot. It's a\nmiracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n  \n \n  \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why\nI haven't been able to see her.\"\n  \n \n  Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to\ntake it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,\nand a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,\nas soon as you're well enough to be moved.

Dr. Arnold's voice went on\nafter a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\nIt didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\neven take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\nwhen a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\none time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\ndidn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd\nbeen annoyed, I think.

{"id":"THE_AVENGER_9","contents":"Peter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you\nwere searching for.\"\n  \n \n  His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your\nbrain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve\ninstinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours\nof work. You are a superman.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\n  \n \n  He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he\nstood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but\nlittle in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled\nover his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of\nflesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had\na tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\n  \n \n  He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once\naccidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\n  \n \n  \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so\nlong\u2014keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from\nyou, not telling you, even, about Earth until now\u2014because I had to be\nsure. But now, the waiting is over.\n  \n \n  \"They're still there, I'm sure of it\u2014the people, and the Invaders. You\ncan kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive\nknowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we\nhad a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with\nyou. You are completely, coldly logical, just as\n   \n   they\n   \n  are. You can\nunderstand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What\u2014what did\nyou say?\"\n  \n \n  I repeated it patiently.\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an\ninstant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his\nsuffering, but I could recognize it.\n  \n \n  \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just\nas the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the\nthings which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I\nwent to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as\nthe invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are\nmore nearly kin to me than your people.\""}

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes."}
{"id":"The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_2","contents":"When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\n  \n \n  The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\n  \n \n  The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\n  \n \n  And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\n  \n \n  He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\n  \n \n  He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\n  \n \n  He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\n  \n \n  He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\n  \n \n  And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\n  \n \n  The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\n  \n \n  Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\n  \n \n  The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\n  \n \n  He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\n  \n \n  The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\n  \n \n  Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal."}
{"id":"The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_3","contents":"The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout."}
{"id":"The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_4","contents":"Then one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\n  \n \n  The crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\n  \n \n  Eric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\n  \n \n  The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\n  \n \n  A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n  \n \n  \"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\n  \n \n  Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\n  \n \n \n \n  She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\n  \n \n  She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\n  \n \n  Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\n  \n \n  After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\n  \n \n  The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\n  \n \n  Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\n  \n \n  Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\n  \n \n  The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\n  \n \n  Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\n  \n \n  There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\""}
{"id":"The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_5","contents":"Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n  \n \n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n  \n \n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n  \n \n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n  \n \n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n  \n \n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n  \n \n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n  \n \n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n  \n \n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n  \n \n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n  \n \n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing.

He was the man people thought of when the word\n\"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether\nhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been\nable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but\nlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The\ngovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the\nIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\n  \n \n  For the past seven years Macklin\u2014who\n   \n   was\n   \n  the Advanced Studies\nDepartment of Firestone University\u2014had been involved in devising a\nfaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the\nnearer stars.

If so, it was a case of\n   \n   Ad\nastra per aspirin\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.\n  \n \n  Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild\nstroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was\nknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of\nthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several\nweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen\naround the campus."}

He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. \"If those are his wishes, I can't go against them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Mrs. Macklin!\" Mitchell protested. \"You will have to get a court\norder overruling your husband's wishes.\"\n  \n \n  She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. \"That\nwas my original thought. But I've redecided.\"\n  \n \n  \"Redecided!\" Carson burst out almost hysterically.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put\nhim back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again,\nwhere he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy\nnow. Like a child, but happy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the Army man said levelly, \"if you don't help us\nrestore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order\ndeclaring him incompetent.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he is not! Legally, I mean,\" the woman stormed.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us\nthe edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once\nhe's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and\nFerris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin\nto sanity.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said.\n  \n \n  The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is\ninvolved.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of\nvascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to\ngive those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To\nparalyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment\nthere is\n   \n   no\n   \n  chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs.\nMacklin,\" Mitchell interjected.\n  \n \n  Her mouth grew petulant. \"I don't care. I would rather have a live\nhusband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him\ncomfortable....\"\n  \n \n  Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led\nhim back into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"I'm no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin\nstupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life,\nand now she can dominate him completely.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous\nof her husband's genius.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don't know. I don't know what the hell to tell\nthe Pentagon. I think I'll go out and get drunk.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go with you,\" Ferris said.\n  \n \n  Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.\n  \n \n  Carson squinted. \"Any particular reason, doctor?\"\n  \n \n  \"To celebrate,\" Ferris said.\n  \n \n  The colonel shrugged. \"That's as good a reason as any.\"\n  \n \n  On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together in\nbewilderment.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Macklin was playing jacks.\n  \n \n  He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great\ncurving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto\nand the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not\nhis head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed \"M\" so it was all the\nsame.\n  \n \n \n \n  Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.\n  \n \n  He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his\nheart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from\nthe nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.\n  \n \n  After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.\n  \n \n  \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said.\n  \n \n  Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the\nphone instead of his wife.\n  \n \n  \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean, are you alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Army\ndoctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him give\nme anything, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good boy,\" the biologist said. \"Listen, doctor\u2014Elliot\u2014El, old son.\nI'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you go\nback to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me,\ndon't you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a slight hesitation.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Macklin said, \"if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?\"\n  \n \n  \"But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if\nI could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly.\n  \n \n  \"You've found yourself worrying\u2014thinking\u2014about a lot of other\nproblems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind of\nscientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used to\nhave time to think about.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of those\nworries just as you got rid of the others?\" Mitchell asked.\n  \n \n  \"I guess I'd like that,\" the mathematician replied.\n  \n \n  \"Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don't\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I\u2014yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put me\nback where I was instead of helping me more?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so. But I don't guess I can come anyway. The Army is\nwatching me pretty close.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's alright,\" Mitchell said quickly. \"You can bring along Colonel\nCarson.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he won't like you fixing me up more.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he can't stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me\u2014I\nwant you to come right on over here, El.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so,\" Macklin said uncertainly."}

It made a one-night\n   \n  pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to\n   \n  find that death stalked it from the\n   \n  jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He\nknocked over the pitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  , but it didn't matter. The pitcher\nwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\nvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\nspring them.\n  \n \n  \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\ndown the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n  \n \n  \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\na curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\nI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\nSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n  \n \n  \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a\nlot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\nI've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\neleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!\nNothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n  \n \n  I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\nBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face\nunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n  \n \n  Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\ngrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\ngirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\nslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\ntoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n  \n \n  I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\nShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n  \n \n  I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n  \n \n  Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\nShannon?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\npleasantly and said, very gently:\n  \n \n  \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n  \n \n  I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if\nhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\nsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n  \n \n  The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\nin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\ngrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\nclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\nwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n  \n \n  There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\nblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n  \n \n  I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\nback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\ngot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\nand let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n  \n \n  Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n  \n \n  I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\nIt knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\nquivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n  \n \n  Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you,\nJig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n  \n \n  The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm\nShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\nthe table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\nstayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\nthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\never met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more\nthan you could see through sheet metal.\n  \n \n  I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n\"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\nlike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\nBeamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.\""}
{"id":"The_Blue_Behemoth_2","contents":"I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't\nsay anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\npitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n  \n \n  \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n  \n \n  Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\nindependent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\nthe burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\nstarted to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n  \n \n  He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\nignored him. He went on, quietly,\n  \n \n  \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\nvaluable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\ntoil and boredom....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\nentertainment of the\u2014\n   \n   proper\n   \n  sort has been available. I propose to\nremedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\na tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n  \n \n  Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\nspeak, and I kicked him again.\n  \n \n  \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\nseveral engagements....\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n  \n \n  \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n  \n \n  The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\nglared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n  \n \n  It was Gow, our zoo-man\u2014a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\ncolony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\nscenery\u2014scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\ncurtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\nthan the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n  \n \n  Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\nain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\nfit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\nsee? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\nship'll hold her.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\ncleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\nfinished for him.\n  \n \n  \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\nVenusian\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\nBrothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n  \n \n  She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\na little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\nwouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\ncircus than even I could stand.\n  \n \n  Beamish looked impressed. \"A\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . Well, well! The mystery\nsurrounding the origin and species of the\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  is a fascinating\nsubject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n  \n \n  We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\nat least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n  \n \n  It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\nBeamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\nsecond I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\nstomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\nagreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\noff half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n  \n \n  \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\nthe morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n  \n \n  We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\ngrab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n  \n \n  \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\nHere.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\ncan get lushed enough on this.\"\n  \n \n  Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\nhe said suddenly,\n  \n \n  \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\"\n  \n \n  \"It may be crooked.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\nyelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\nwhere the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\npoked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\n   \n   thildatum\n   \n  !\""}
{"id":"The_Blue_Behemoth_3","contents":"It was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where\nShannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late\nas it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting\naround and smoking and looking very ugly.\n  \n \n  It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless\nunder the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead and\ndried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown\nred dust gritted in my teeth.\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to\nthe roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his\nfeet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\n  \n \n  They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I\ngrinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more\nthan money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out of\nhis own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in\nweeks we'd come in at the front door.\n  \n \n  I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,\nBucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.\nBucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\n  \n \n  \"Now?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" I said.\n  \n \n  We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join\nin. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went\nhome happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\n  \n \n  The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the\ngreen girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the\nmuscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers\nand joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the\npassageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\n\"They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I've\nrewarded them.\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\n  \n \n  \"Let's go see Gertrude.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going\ninto the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a city\nguy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But\nBucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....\"\n  \n \n  The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall down\nthe ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't....\nOh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends?\n  \n \n  It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was\na dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand. We started down\nthe long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and\ncompression units.\n  \n \n  Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn't\nnear as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It's\nthe smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,\nbreathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled\naround them as strong as the cage bars.\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and\nthen wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.\nA high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,\nripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\n  \n \n  It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same\ntime. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I\ncould think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a great\nmetallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow\nhad them nicely conditioned to that gong."}
{"id":"The_Blue_Behemoth_4","contents":"But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel\nthem inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of\nthem.

They were uneasy that night,\nall of a sudden....\n  \n \n  Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She's gettin'\nworse,\" he said. \"She's lonesome.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an\nowl's. He swayed slightly. \"That's sure tough.\" He sniffled.\n  \n \n  I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank\nand even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a\ndeep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . There's only\ntwo of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will\nmake much difference.\n  \n \n  They're what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old\nDame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The\n   \n   cansins\n   \n  were pretty\nsuccessful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and\nnow there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even\nthe Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\n  \n \n  I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck\nsome place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little\nbird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.\n  \n \n  I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage\nwith her hands\u2014yeah, hands\u2014hanging over her knees and her snaky head\nsunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.\nHer eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\n  \n \n  The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the\nmane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes\nclear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like\nold Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\n  \n \n  Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow!\nNobody's ever seen a male\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . There may not even be any.\"\n  \n \n  Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head.\nThe sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That\nclose, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold\ninside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You'll have to snap her out of\nthis, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.\"\n  \n \n  He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood\nlooking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he\nturned to Gertrude.\n  \n \n  \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak's wreck\nand everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know\nher. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\n  \n \n  He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a\nwoman's talking about a sick child.\n  \n \n  \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain't sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need\nher.\" I took Shannon's arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.\"\n  \n \n  He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at\nus. Bucky sobbed.\n  \n \n  \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But\nit's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with\nGertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\n  \n \n  We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed\nhigh and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all\naround us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\n  \n \n  Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist\nrose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly\nwith blue, cold fire.\n  \n \n  I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow\u2014for God's sake!\"\n  \n \n  I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp\nand heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and\nroars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all\nI could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.\n  \n \n  I thought, \"\n   \n   Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wants\nto kill us!\n   \n  \" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I\nsobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\n  \n \n  One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I\nrolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the\nhollow of his shoulder.\n  \n \n  The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the\nback of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my\nmouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\n  \n \n  Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\n\"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!\"\n  \n \n  Then I went out.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His\nlittle brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of his\nteeth, and he gummed\n   \n   thak\n   \n  -weed. It smelt.\n  \n \n  \"You pretty, Mis' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\n  \n \n  He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and\nsaid, \"Where's Shannon? How is he?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow come\nnickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down\na couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the\nwashstand\u2014I was in my own cell\u2014and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned\nsnakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch\nplaid. I felt sick.\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was\na big burn across his neck. He said:\n  \n \n  \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\n  \n \n  Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\n  \n \n  \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in.\nSomebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\n  \n \n  I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far.\nNobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.\"\n  \n \n  \"One hundred U.C.'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge\nmining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged. \"You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off the\ncreditors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn't a\ncomfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign.\" He put his hand on the\nlatch and looked at my feet. \"And\u2014uh\u2014Jig, I....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!\"\n  \n \n  We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,\nand Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking\nlike a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian\nstrong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had\nkittens.\n  \n \n  Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. It\nlived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out\nof their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\n  \n \n  Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.\nAnybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It\ndidn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at\ndinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I\nwas ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\n  \n \n  Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our\nitinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It\nwas Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a\nbunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle\nof it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\n  \n \n  I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and\nour router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\n  \n \n  \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\n  \n \n  I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and\nwent out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they\nweren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus\nheat was already sneaking into the ship.\n  \n \n  While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,\nscreaming."}
{"id":"The_Blue_Behemoth_5","contents":"The canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in\nthe mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I\nstood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\n  \n \n  I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was\nstanding in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her\ntriangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn't have anything on\nbut her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn't\nsound nice.\n  \n \n  You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with\nthe electric power they carry in their own bodies. They're Venusian\nmiddle-swampers, they're not human, and they never forget it.\n  \n \n  Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with\nwhite reptilian teeth.\n  \n \n  \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can\nsmell it in the swamp wind.\"\n  \n \n  The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under\nher jaw pulsed like a toad's, and her eyes were red.\n  \n \n  \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken.\nThey are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\n  \n \n  She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight\nand cold. Bucky said,\n  \n \n  \"Let's eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\n  \n \n  We weren't half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing\nfield when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We\ncould see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\n  \n \n  He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or\nfour tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\n  \n \n  Bucky said, \"Jig\u2014it's Sam Kapper.\"\n  \n \n  We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled\naround to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man\nwho crawled and whimpered in the mud.\n  \n \n  Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and\ncarnivals. He'd given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren't\ntoo broke, and we were pretty friendly.\n  \n \n  I hadn't seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed,\nhard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick,\nlooking down at him.\n  \n \n  Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over\nlike animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over\nand put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\n  \n \n  I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I\nonly caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't\nrealize until later that he looked familiar.\n  \n \n  We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a\ncouple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled\nthe curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the\ncigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\n  \n \n  Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What's the trouble?\""}
{"id":"The_Blue_Behemoth_6","contents":"Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines\nof his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\nwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n  \n \n  He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n  \n \n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n  \n \n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned.

{"id":"The_CONJURER_of_VENUS_1","contents":"The CONJURER of VENUS\n  \n \n  By CONAN T. TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n  \n \n  \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n  \n \n  For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\""}
{"id":"The_CONJURER_of_VENUS_2","contents":"\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose."}
{"id":"The_CONJURER_of_VENUS_3","contents":"Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers\nsought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He\ncaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened\nand became a rock.\n  \n \n  Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light\nhad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the\nimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three\nhundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe\nthat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the\nspotlight as if by magic.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n  \n \n  No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n  \n \n  Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound\npassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself\nflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently\nwent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest\ntake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n  \n \n  The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers\ndug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for\nprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She\ndrew closer to him.\n  \n \n  A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able\nto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was\nsuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she\nhad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n  \n \n  Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer\nlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his\nbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation\nwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he\nsensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this\nway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these\nRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself\nwas not prepared to disagree.\n  \n \n  Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...\ngoing.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience\nto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n  \n \n  The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,\nperhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music\nand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else\nthat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium\nsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.\nHe was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...\n  \n \n \n   watching a space ship float in an endless void\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into\nhis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,\nthe sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and\nCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not\nin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he\nknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out\non the periphery of his universe, perhaps of\n   \n   the\n   \n  universe.\n  \n \n  All he saw was the space ship.\n  \n \n  It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen\nin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n  \n \n  Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off\nstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his\ndestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was\nthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n  \n \n  The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and\nthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now\nhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n  \n \n  He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who\nwas Vee Vee?\n  \n \n  The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship\nvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,\nat Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n  \n \n  \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on\nhis arm.\n  \n \n  \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n  \n \n  \"See what?\"\n  \n \n  \"The space ship!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.\n\"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact\nwith my dream.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your dream?\"\n  \n \n  He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,\nand look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of\nsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left\ntold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The\nVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat\nof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a\nhigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had\nnot heard it before in this place.\n  \n \n  He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n  \n \n  The vision would not come.\n  \n \n  He shook his head and tried again.\n  \n \n  Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a\nwoman in love.\n  \n \n  He tried again for the space ship.\n  \n \n  It would not come.\n  \n \n  Anger came up instead.\n  \n \n  Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept\nintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n  \n \n  So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not\ndreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n  \n \n  His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n  \n \n  Cold flowed over him.\n  \n \n  Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n  \n \n  The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here\nand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to\nVenus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.\nAnother voice took its place.\n  \n \n  \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...\nthis is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian\nDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,\ncan float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n  \n \n  \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.\nWe are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian\nBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n  \n \n  \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our\nmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some\nother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n  \n \n  \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n  \n \n  A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if\nthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to\nhim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days\nwhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n  \n \n  \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n  \n \n  The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,\nMaster! Do something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n  \n \n  \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,\nif action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we\ncan all die.\"\n  \n \n  \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go\ntogether.\"\n  \n \n  The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the\nlittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n  \n \n  \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n  \n \n  \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n  \n \n  \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see\nthem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that\nforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n  \n \n  \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a\nVenusian being jarred out of his dream.\n  \n \n  \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n  \n \n  A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n  \n \n  Unger fell.\n  \n \n  He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,\nbody-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n  \n \n  There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The\nsilence went. Voices came.\n  \n \n  \"Who did that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked\nthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the\nmeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At\nhis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was\nback in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as\nif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n  \n \n  On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up\naround his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came\nhungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n  \n \n  \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back\nof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of\nVenusians were attacking a man.\n  \n \n  \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  here!\"\n  \n \n  In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired\nblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft\nthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\nStruck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But\nthere seemed to be an endless number of them.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had\nslid out of his sight.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n  \n \n  \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important\none.\"\n  \n \n  Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.\nJohnson followed."}

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days."}
{"id":"THE_CREATURES_THAT_TIME_FORGOT_2","contents":"The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n   \n   short\n   \n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n  \n \n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n  \n \n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n  \n \n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n  \n \n \n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n   \n \n \n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n   \n   long\n   \n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n  \n \n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n  \n \n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability."}

Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths."}
{"id":"THE_CREATURES_THAT_TIME_FORGOT_4","contents":"All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves."}

They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon."}

KASTLE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by von Dongen\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n   The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be\nwelcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a\nhero...?\n   \n \n \n  There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual\nspeeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had\nonce been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had\nsince engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything\nwasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as\nat-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,\none of the crew of the spaceship\n   \n   Washington\n   \n  , first to set Americans\nupon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His\nHonor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n  \n \n  Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the\nhometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal\ntour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat\nbetween the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,\nand looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National\nGuard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of\nthe churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their\nparishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous\nnational interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them\ncome around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as\nthey'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as the\nnewspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014the\nGalloping Twenties.\n  \n \n  He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man\nand he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than\nany man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a\nkiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old\nfriends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.\nHe wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps\nhe would talk.\n  \n \n  Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had\nreturned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great\nmariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,\npassing, and then the arrival.\n  \n \n  The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him\noff at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.\nThey had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,\nalmost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had\nwanted it to be as before.\n  \n \n  The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had\nescorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.\nHe was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with\nstrangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing\nbeside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,\ntheir eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was\nstill too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n  \n \n  He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate\nflagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental\nknocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was\nsurprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching\nat a window.\n  \n \n  And perhaps she\n   \n   had\n   \n  been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n  \n \n  The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she\nhadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved\nin high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.\nRalphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual\nsupport, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They\nlooked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,\n\"It's good to be home!\"\n  \n \n  Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other\narm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the old\njokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the\nand-\n   \n   then\n   \n  -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.\nShe was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the\ndifference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to\nRalphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could\nthink of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n  \n \n  Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the\nfloor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I\ndidn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n  \n \n  So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that\neverything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General\nCarlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left\nWashington.\n  \n \n  \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need\nthe time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\""}
{"id":"THE_FIRST_ONE_2","contents":"Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,\na cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat\ndown beside him\u2014but she had hesitated. He\n   \n   wasn't\n   \n  being sensitive; she\nhad hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n  \n \n  Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De\nGama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon\u2014but more\nso. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked\nwith him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic\njourney\u2014even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius\nin uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.\n  \n \n \n   The eyes. It always showed in their eyes.\n   \n \n \n  He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy\nalready tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of\nfeature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself\ntwenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a\nway that few ten-year-old faces are.\n  \n \n  \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty good.\"\n  \n \n  Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and\nhe made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the\nwarmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as\nhe left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had\nfeared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in\ncontinent-to-continent experimental flight.\n  \n \n  They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.\nBut now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the\nlong journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt\nand the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's\nHarmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,\nhe waved his hand\u2014it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook\u2014and\nran from the room and from the house.\n  \n \n  He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in\nhis arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very\ntired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd\nbeen lying down all the months of the way back.\n  \n \n  She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and\nmake small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do\u2014make small talk\nand pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;\nthey wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much."}
{"id":"THE_FIRST_ONE_3","contents":"She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past\nthe small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was\nnewly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an\nornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more\nominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire\nfence around the experimental station.\n  \n \n  \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n  \n \n  She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the\nfresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you\nto get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.\nYou always said it reminded you\u2014being able to see the sky\u2014that you\nwere going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it\nto this bed again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n  \n \n  \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom\nset and I really didn't know\u2014\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n  \n \n  He was sure then that she\n   \n   had\n   \n  known, and that the beds and the barrier\nbetween them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went\nto the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,\nbegan to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars\nstill showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n  \n \n  She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n  \n \n  He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite\nwall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the\nscars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing\ndiagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.\nThere were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd\nbeen treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen\nthem.\n  \n \n  Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would\nkeep them from her until they were gone.\n  \n \n  Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter\nReed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found\ndistasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,\nhe began to understand that there would be many things, previously\nbeneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;\nRalphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably\nchanged\u2014because they thought\n   \n   he\n   \n  had changed.\n  \n \n  He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let\nhimself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known\nbefore.\n  \n \n  But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began\nfiltering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same\nman who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and\nfriends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could\ncommunicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One\nwould again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for\u2014a\nreturn to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash\ninstead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be\ngranted to him.\n  \n \n  He slept."}
{"id":"THE_FIRST_ONE_4","contents":"Dinner was at seven\n  p.m.\n  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille\ncame. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate\nin the dining room at the big table.\n  \n \n  Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His\nfamily had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of\ntalkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes\u2014especially with\ncompany present\u2014to describe everything and anything that had happened\nto him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially\nwith his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been\ngood-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n  \n \n  This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"\nwas perhaps the word.\n  \n \n  They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,\nefficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked\nat Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,\n\"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times\nbefore, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip\nsomething like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time\nshe burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was\nthe fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort\nher; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n  \n \n  He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched\nher left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move\nit\u2014she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool\nembrace at the door\u2014then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it\ndrop out of sight.\n  \n \n  So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,\nthe hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n  \n \n  The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe\nbegan to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform\nhouses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.\n\"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before\u2014\" At that point he\nlooked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in\nthis normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,\nmumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a\nlittle; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n  \n \n  Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday\nGarden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between\nJoe and Mother\u2014his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt\nalone\u2014and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose\nbushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or\ntrowel.\"\n  \n \n  Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that\u2014a pitiful twitching of\nthe lips\u2014and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,\nand then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I\nhave a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a\nwhile.\" She touched his shoulder in passing\u2014his affectionate, effusive\nmother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often\nirritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses\u2014she barely\ntouched his shoulder and fled.\n  \n \n  So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served\u2014thin, rare\nslices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He\ncut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie\nand said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"\nRalphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and\nmurmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said\nLucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going\ninto the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of\ncourse,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n  \n \n  Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at\nRalphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was\nchewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at\nLucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n  \n \n  He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass\noverturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They\nwere all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big\nright fist\u2014Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a\nscene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the\nFirst One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear\nof, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n  \n \n  Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n  \n \n  He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of\nthe lot of you.\""}
{"id":"THE_FIRST_ONE_5","contents":"Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food\ndown his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear\u2014\" He didn't answer. She began\nto cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said\nanything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been\nthe time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about\ngetting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"\nand he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n  \n \n  He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special\ndessert she'd been preparing half the day\u2014a magnificent English trifle.\nShe served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She\nhesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the\nboy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the\ntable. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,\n\"Hey, I promised\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or\nsomething; anything to get away from your father.\"\n  \n \n  Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n  \n \n  Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening\ntogether\u2014talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n  \n \n  Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n  \n \n  Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I\nwant to. The question is whether\n   \n   you\n   \n  want to.\"\n  \n \n  They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their\neyes\u2014his wife's and son's eyes\u2014could not meet his, and so he said he\nwas going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in\nall probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that\nthey shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n  \n \n  He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n  \n \n  But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a\nlighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,\nand it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I\ncould barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want\nto go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n  \n \n  He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful\ntimes together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and\nclosest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n  \n \n  Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down!"}
{"id":"THE_FIRST_ONE_6","contents":"It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd\nalso expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to\nexpect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded\nvery much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter and\nfull of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and\nclapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so much\nmore gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was\ngood for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along\non the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n  \n \n  They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to\nManfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee\nand Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he\nmerely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n  \n \n  There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there\nmany times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized\nhim. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as\nif he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n  \n \n  At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he\nsaid, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his\nmind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her\nface\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual\nof flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going\nto be sick.\n  \n \n  \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n  \n \n  They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.\nAnd through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,\nmechanical dancing doll.\n  \n \n  The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,\n\"Beddy-bye time.\"\n  \n \n  Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n  \n \n  He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited\nfor her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.\nBecause while she put herself against him, there was something in her\nface\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him know\nshe was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when\nthe music ended, he was ready to go home.\n  \n \n  They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of\nPhil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,\nPhil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old\nself. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with\nthe First One.\n  \n \n  They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and\nPhil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and\nlooked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence\nparalleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's\nthe most popular place on earth?\"\n  \n \n  Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a\nlittle sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a\nwhile longer, not yet aware of his supposed\n   \n   faux pas\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter\nrumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n  \n \n  Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n  \n \n  Phil said, \"Because people are\u2014\" And then he caught himself and waved\nhis hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the\nwindow, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting\ntombstones.\n  \n \n  The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been\nnothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should\nlet me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home\u2014or that's what everyone\nseems to think.

Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\nin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\nfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\nwas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there were\nany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\nwere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\nangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\nstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\nlocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had\ndone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\nand Saiph ... it happened.\n  \n \n  The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\ncollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\nand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\nthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\nhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\ndangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\nthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\nit.\n  \n \n  McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n  \n \n  Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not\nquite utter silence.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\nlike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\nstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n  \n \n  Probably it was only an illusion.\n  \n \n  But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n  \n \n  It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\nfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n   \n   Starship Jodrell Bank\n   \n  to\nthis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\nhurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\nexasperation: \"If I could only\n   \n   see\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\nbaker's dough, not at all resilient.\n  \n \n  A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\nwas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor."}
{"id":"THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_2","contents":"It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was the\nlight? And what were these other things in the room?\n  \n \n  Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like\nhaving tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was\nlooking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could\nsee made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct\na logical explanation for that with no trouble\u2014maybe a subspace\nmeteorite striking the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  , an explosion, himself knocked\nout, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more\nholes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n  \n \n  How to explain a set of Gibbon's\n   \n   Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire?\n   \n  A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the\nchemistry set\u2014or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric\nthat, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing\nsuit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of\nthe objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair\u2014why,\nhe'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old\nenough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n  \n \n  Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were\nstrange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were\nnot papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made\nof some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or\nprocessed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.\nBut they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"\u2014the color of aged\ndriftwood or unbleached cloth.\n  \n \n  Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth\nwall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;\nfrom them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be\nventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse\nthan what he already had.\n  \n \n  McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a\nlittle light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his\ncourage flowed back when he could see again.\n  \n \n  He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago\u2014subjectively it\nseemed to be minutes\u2014he had been aboard the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  with\nnothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting\none of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being\nshaken up and\u2014he admitted it\u2014scared damn near witless, he did not\nseem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what\nhad happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n  \n \n  He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been\nan accident to the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a\ncooling brain.\n  \n \n  McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow\nrefreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head\nhe remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n  \n \n  It held a radio.\n  \n \n  He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest\nof the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he\nsaid, \"calling the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling\n   \n   Jodrell\nBank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n  \n \n  But there was no answer.\n  \n \n  Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,\nsomething more than a million times faster than light, with a range\nmeasured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,\nhe was a good long way from anywhere.\n  \n \n  Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n  \n \n  He reached for the microphone again\u2014\n  \n \n  He cried aloud.\n  \n \n  The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than\nbefore.\n  \n \n  For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped\nhis eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in\nthe pinkish glimmer; but the hand\u2014his own hand, cupped to hold the\nmicrophone\u2014he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting\nmoment of study, his chest.\n  \n \n  McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Someone else could.\n  \n \n  Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination\nof a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new\nantibiotic\u2014and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,\nsailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that\n   \n   may\n   \n  contain food.\n  \n \n  Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\")\nHatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but\nit did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in\nany way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n  \n \n  If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,\nthey might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an\nadventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences\nof his culture. Both enjoyed games\u2014McCray baseball, poker and\nthree-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human\ndescription. Both held positions of some importance\u2014considering their\nages\u2014in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n  \n \n  Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,\nhard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were\nnot organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which\nobeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes\ncurl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well\na yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested\nin the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater\ndistances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of\nInverse Squares.\n  \n \n  Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\"\nwhich had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little\nexcited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on\nvarious errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest\nlimbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a\nstate of violent commotion.\n  \n \n  The probe team had had a shock.\n  \n \n  \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the\nothers mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the\nspecimen from Earth.\n  \n \n  After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n\"Incredible\u2014but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch\nhim,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to\nwatch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of\nthem could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of\na creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as\nHerrell McCray."}
{"id":"THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_3","contents":"Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure in\nwhich he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of all\nprobes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once.\n  \n \n  Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report:\n  \n \n  \"The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began to\ninspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his own\nmembers in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure.\nAfter observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unable\nto see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him.\n  \n \n  \"This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relatively\nundisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact,\nmanipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we had\nprovided for him.\n  \n \n  \"He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organs\nin his breathing passage.\n  \n \n  \"Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificial\nskin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.\"\n  \n \n  The supervising council rocked with excitement. \"You're sure?\" demanded\none of the councilmen.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forces\nnow, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulating\na carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by the\nvibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fantastic,\" breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. \"How\nabout communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but\nwe thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\"\n  \n \n  The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. It\nwas not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left in\nthe probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was going\non\u2014knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in the\ndark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room for\nhim briefly and again produced the rising panic.\n  \n \n  Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back.\n  \n \n  \"Stop fidgeting,\" commanded the council leader abruptly. \"Hatcher, you\nare to establish communication at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, sir....\" Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly;\nhe would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesture\nwith. \"We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homey\nfor him\u2014\" actually, what he said was more like,\n   \n   we've warmed the\nbiophysical nuances of his enclosure\n   \n  \u2014\"and tried to guess his needs;\nand we're frightening him half to death. We\n   \n   can't\n   \n  go faster. This\ncreature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormal\nforces\u2014heat, light, kinetic energy\u2014for his life. His chemistry is not\nours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism is\ncloser to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatures\nwere intelligent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in\n   \n   a\n   \n  way, and you must learn that way. I know.\" One lobster-claw\nshaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itself\nin an admonitory gesture. \"You want time. But we don't have time,\nHatcher. Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Masses\nteam has just turned in a most alarming report.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have they secured a subject?\" Hatcher demanded jealously.\n  \n \n  The councillor paused. \"Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their\nsubjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.\"\n  \n \n  There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. The\ncouncil room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spoke\nagain, each council member poised over his locus-point, his members\ndrifting about him.\n  \n \n  Finally the councillor said, \"I speak for all of us, I think. If the\nOld Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerably\nnarrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all. You must do\neverything you can to establish communication with your subject.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the danger to the specimen\u2014\" Hatcher protested automatically.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014is no greater,\" said the councillor, \"than the danger to every one\nof us if we do not find allies\n   \n   now\n   \n  .\""}
{"id":"THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_4","contents":"Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.\n  \n \n  It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a\nreputation for demanding results at any cost\u2014even at the cost of\ndestroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.\n  \n \n  Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot\nbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathy\nthat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward\ncommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting\nphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But\nHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough\ngetting him here.\n  \n \n  Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of\nhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he\ntook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not\nentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his\nbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which\nHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the\neating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture\nof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for\nanother day.\n  \n \n  He returned quickly to the room.\n  \n \n  His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers\nreported\u2014nothing new\u2014and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the\ncouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his\nstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but\ndecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other\nhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was\nnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat\nof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical\nbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in\nages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and\nhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it\u2014with\nits population\u2014as a decoy, had they arrived at all.\n  \n \n  Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near\nthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they\nhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of\nfleeing again.\n  \n \n  But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their\nexistence to their enemies\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Hatcher!\"\n  \n \n  The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his\nsecond in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Wait....\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something\nwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to\nhim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted\nthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into\nhis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had\njust taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image\nwas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a\ncathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to\nshow.\n  \n \n  Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And\u2014is it a different species? Or\nmerely a different sex?\"\n  \n \n  \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited.\n  \n \n  Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n\"No matter,\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\"\n  \n \n  And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We\nmay be in the process of killing our first one now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Killing him, Hatcher?\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like\npuppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to\ngo into Stage Two of the project at once.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,\nhe had an inspiration.\n  \n \n  The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been\nand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to\nhave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed\nit.\n  \n \n  Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything\u2014even\nhimself.\n  \n \n  \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that\npinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now\nthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects\non some strange property of the light.\n  \n \n  At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n  \n \n  He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n  \n \n  For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm and\nalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was\ngone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had\nhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,\nperhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very\nfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n  \n \n  McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no\nchange.\n  \n \n  And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n  \n \n  He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell\none. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger\nnow. He stood there, perplexed.\n  \n \n  A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,\namazement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you\ncalling from?\"\n  \n \n  He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. \"This\nis Herrell McCray,\" he cried. \"I'm in a room of some sort, apparently\non a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  calling. Answer, please!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   am\n   \n  answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\"\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell McCray,\nHerrell McCray, this is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  responding to your message,\nacknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\"\n  \n \n  It kept on, and on.\n  \n \n  McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they\ndidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or\u2014no.\nThat was not it; they\n   \n   had\n   \n  heard him, because they were responding.\nBut it seemed to take them so long....\n  \n \n  Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his\nmind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was\nit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n  \n \n  Did that mean\u2014did it\n   \n   possibly\n   \n  mean\u2014that there was a lag of an hour\nor two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his\nsuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took\n   \n   hours\n   \n  to get a message to the ship and back?\n  \n \n  And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?"}
{"id":"THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_5","contents":"Herrell McCray was a navigator, which is to say, a man who has learned\nto trust the evidence of mathematics and instrument readings beyond the\nguesses of his \"common sense.\" When\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  , hurtling faster\nthan light in its voyage between stars, made its regular position\ncheck, common sense was a liar. Light bore false witness.

Perhaps it was impossible to believe what the radio's\nmessage implied; but it was not necessary to \"believe,\" only to act.\n  \n \n  McCray thumbed down the transmitter button and gave a concise report\nof his situation and his guesses. \"I don't know how I got here.

And warm.\n  \n \n  Very warm, he thought tardily; and more than that. The halogen stench\nwas strong in his nostrils again.\n  \n \n  Hurriedly McCray scrambled into the suit. By the time he was sealed\ndown he was coughing from the bottom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps\nthat pained him, uncontrollable. Chlorine or fluorine, one of them was\nin the air he had been breathing. He could not guess where it had come\nfrom; but it was ripping his lungs out.\n  \n \n  He flushed the interior of the suit out with a reckless disregard for\nthe wastage of his air reserve, holding his breath as much as he could,\ndaring only shallow gasps that made him retch and gag.

It was good up to at least five hundred degrees in thin\nair, perhaps three or four hundred in dense. In thin air or in space it\nwas the elastic joints and couplings that depolymerized when the heat\ngrew too great; in dense air, with conduction pouring energy in faster\nthan the cooling coils could suck it out and hurl it away, it was the\nrefrigerating equipment that broke down.\n  \n \n  McCray had no way of knowing just how hot it was going to get. Nor,\nfor that matter, had the suit been designed to operate in a corrosive\nmedium.\n  \n \n  All in all it was time for him to do something."}
{"id":"THE_FIVE_HELLS_OF_ORION_6","contents":"Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax,\ntungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft.\n  \n \n  McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his\ngauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the\nman who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something\nconcrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had\nbeen brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could,\ndo next; all those questions could recede into the background of his\nmind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned\noven.\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Crash-clang!\n   \n  The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his\ngauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see\nthe plastic\u2014or whatever it was\u2014of the door. It was chipping out. Not\neasily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white\npowdery residue.\n  \n \n  At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through\nit. Did he have an hour?\n  \n \n  But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it\nmust have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar.\nMcCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide.\n  \n \n  He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare.\n  \n \n  McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it\nas nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out,\nbut it would retard them.\n  \n \n  The room was again unlighted\u2014at least to McCray's eyes. There was not\neven that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing\nbut the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were\nevidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been\ncupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have\nbeen workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not\npossible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them.\nSome were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended\nfrom the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these\nbenches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants\nor shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the\nback of his neck.\n  \n \n  He tapped half-heartedly at one of the closed cupboards, and was not\nsurprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he\ncould batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of\nits contents when he was through; and there was the question of time.\n  \n \n  But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches.\nMetallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a\nstiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he\nthought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun.\n  \n \n  In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even\na couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked\nbeside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen\nin survival locker, on the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  \u2014and abruptly wished he were\ncarrying now\u2014but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange\nassortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had\nbeen more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was\nprepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard.\n  \n \n  The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals\nall along:\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  calling Herrell McCray....\"\n  \n \n  And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits\ntoned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in\npanic and fear: \"\n   \n   Jodrell Bank!\n   \n  Where are you? Help!\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first\nsurvival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and\na troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and\nseemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher,\nit was something far more immediate to his interests.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\"\n  \n \n  His assistant vibrated startlement.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight\ntoward her.\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but\nhe did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was\ncause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty,\nneeded so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved\nmuch better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at\nthe queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers.\nHatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and\ndeath. He said, musing:\n  \n \n  \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get\u2014almost\u2014a\nwhisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this\nfemale is perhaps not quite mute.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well.\nRemember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he\nis alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with\nthe female\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But?\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\""}

A fifth leaned\nagainst the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.\n  \n \n  At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform\nand with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male\npassengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional\nglances Retief's way.\n  \n \n  A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair.

It\nwould be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against.\n  \n \n  Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and\ncoffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room.

The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took\na cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted\nend in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.\n  \n \n  The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.\n  \n \n  \"You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad,\" the thug said in a\ngrating voice. \"What's your game, hick?\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I want my coffee,\" he said.

They had grown\nsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, of\nnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n  \n \n  But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they\ncame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed\nthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born\nin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low\nvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might\nlie at the long journey's end. For the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  was coming home; the\nsun ahead was\n   \n   the\n   \n  Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning."}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_2","contents":"Knof Llud, the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth.

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\""}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_4","contents":"Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That\nwas from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first\ndisappointments.\n  \n \n  He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four\nyears old.

It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enough\nfuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after\nmore than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and\nperhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n  \n \n  \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according\nto the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if the\nother expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstable\nphase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from\noverpopulation.\n  \n \n  \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about\nEarth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a\ndecree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be\nforgotten back there?\n  \n \n  \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signs\nof homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that\nwas once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n  \n \n  Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then\nhe sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n  \n \n  The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake\nhim. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them\nonce in translation from the ancient English....\n  \n \n  ... for my purpose holds\n  \n \n  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n  \n \n  Of all the western stars, until I die."}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_5","contents":"Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight."}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_6","contents":"The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became\nunhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea\nwhat it had been\u2014a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of\nthe Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars\nsuch collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have\nbeen done. The\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  collision armor was nonmaterial and for\npractical purposes invulnerable.\n  \n \n  Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the\nintercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,\nfrowning\u2014surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,\nmaybe\u2014it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n  \n \n  He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook\nthe vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded\ncat.\n  \n \n  \"Captain?\" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,\nwe're being attacked!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,\nthen felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all\nthese years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.\nThere was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start\u2014three\nshort buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the\ninterstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,\n\"Now\u2014attacked by what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a\nsixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  framework. The\nnavigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft, not\nfifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to\nshow them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them\nlong enough to tell much.\"\n  \n \n  \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry\nanything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n  \n \n  In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were\nbig; he had heard his father's words.\n  \n \n  \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old\nseriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,\nhuh, Dad?\"\n  \n \n  Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"\nHe headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n  \n \n  There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.\nTheir faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions\nof horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty\nengines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n  \n \n  To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,\nmost of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof\nLlud.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n  \n \n  Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and\nthey're all banging away at us.\"\n  \n \n  The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen\nwhere occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice\nfrom the same position.\n  \n \n  Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.\nHis young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in\nhis father.\n  \n \n  \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have\nunlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they\ncan't touch us as long as our power lasts\u2014or until they bring up some\nbigger stuff.\""}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_7","contents":"The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,\nwould be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting\nthe\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  shell was doing it at velocities where the\ndistinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n  \n \n  But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive\nfield which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of\nthe ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly\ntransmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and\nall space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A\nmeteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized by\nthe impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite\nforces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its\ndeflection was negligible.\n  \n \n  The people in the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  would have felt nothing at all of\nthe vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their\ninertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,\nwas intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to\nprovide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n  \n \n  One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in\nwait for us. But why on Earth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why\u2014on\nEarth.

Even if\none were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or\nchange course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left\nif there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhaps\nin a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around\nwheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,\nalways attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The\ninterstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of the\nvision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling\nthe watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn\napart.\n  \n \n  Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was\npaying attention to him. The men on the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  bridge looked\nquestions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed\ninto many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, \"It must have\ncaught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored\ntoo direct a hit.\"\n  \n \n  He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been\ngot, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  ,\nexcept that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their\nsize was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance\nand speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by\nthe Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching\nships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than\nGwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.\nTiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n  \n \n  \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine\nas it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human\norigin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy\nthey had explored, but one of the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  might have encountered\nand been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to\nconquer."}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_8","contents":"It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a\nconstant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into\nspace, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That\nargued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind\nit.\n  \n \n  Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate\nwe're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight\nhours.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not\nknowing why we're being attacked.\"\n  \n \n  Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a\nthought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological\nadvantage, too!\"\n  \n \n  His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have\nnoticed it.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he\nhadn't made himself clear, \"In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts\nswinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n  \n \n  Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've\ngot something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in\na position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I\nwas going to say\u2014I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At\nleast we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n  \n \n  And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an\naudio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,\nrepeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n  \n \n  \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that\nthey were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and\nquerying again, \"Who are\n   \n   you\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under\nmultiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater\namounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but\nconverting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own\nnerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of\nhis ship.\n  \n \n  Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,\nCaptain\u2014I've got some data on Earth now.\"\n  \n \n  Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But\nthey told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and\nthose were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up\ninquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n  \n \n  \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.\n\"First of all\u2014there are no lights on the night side. And on the\ndaylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces\nof cities, canals, and the like\u2014but it does not.\n  \n \n  \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal\ngreen vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates\nreflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide\u2014so the\nvegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine\nmoss or even a coarse mold.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n  \n \n  \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well\u2014we tried\nphotography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing\nand likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is\nopaque to it.\"\n  \n \n  The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps\nyou can answer some of these riddles before\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We know who you are\n   \n  ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a\nstrange accent, \"\n   \n   and pleading will do you no good.\n   \n  \""}
{"id":"THE_GIANTS_RETURN_9","contents":"Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from\nhim once more.

The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already\nreturned and been destroyed, as you will soon be\u2014the sooner, if you\ncontinue toward Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice\u2014which must be coming\nfrom Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships\u2014was not very smart; it\nhad already involuntarily told him a couple of things\u2014that it was not\nas sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned\nto speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the\n   \n   Quest\nIII's\n   \n  ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow\nfrightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n  \n \n  He shoved those facts back for future use.

He named a vision frequency.\n  \n \n  \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its\nlanguage that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the\nchanges that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize\nyour position, you will follow the intelligent example of the\n   \n   Quest\nI's\n   \n  commander.\"\n  \n \n  Knof Llud stiffened. The\n   \n   Quest I\n   \n  , launched toward Arcturus and the\nstar cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  the\nmost hopeful of the expeditions\u2014and its captain had been a good friend\nof Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to\nhim?\"\n  \n \n  \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some\ntime,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he\npreferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short\npause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n  \n \n  Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a\npicture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,\nbut undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed\nthe same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the\n   \n   Quest\nIII\n   \n  , but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head\nseemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n  \n \n  He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.\nWhy do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n  \n \n  The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great\neyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a\npoisonous hatred.\n  \n \n  \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\""}

They always balk at a time like this,\nwhen they can see it'll be hard work.\"\n  \n \n  Joseph Hill wiped his plump face and coiled some of the rope's slack\naround his thick waist.\n  \n \n  \"Together now, Karl.\n   \n   One! Two!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  They stood knee-deep in mud on the bank, pulling and straining on the\nrope, while some few yards distant, in the shade of a grove of trees,\ntheir tiny yllumphs nibbled grass and watched them critically, but made\nno effort to come closer.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the list.\"\n  \n \n  Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope.\n  \n \n  \"That's what I've been thinking about,\" he said, worried.\n  \n \n  They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft\nbobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened\nto tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of it\nsolidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling,\nrushing waters, but that didn't matter. They'd be back in ten hours or\nso, long before the heavy raft could be washed free.\n  \n \n  \"How much time have we got, Karl?\"\n  \n \n  The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical eye at\nthem. He estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to help\nbeach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put\ndown at Landing City.\n  \n \n  \"Two hours, maybe a little more,\" he stated hastily when Hill looked\nmore worried. \"Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for our\nnumbers on the list.\"\n  \n \n  He turned back to the raft, untied the leather and horn saddles, and\nthrew them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. He cinched his\nsaddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it.\n  \n \n  Hill watched him curiously. \"What are you taking the furs for? This\nisn't the trading rocket.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and\nmaybe\n   \n   she'll\n   \n  appreciate the coverings then.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never would have thought of it yourself,\" Hill grunted. \"Grundy\nmust have told you to do it, the old fool. If you ask me, the less\nyou give them, the less they'll come to expect. Once you spoil them,\nthey'll expect you to do all the trapping and the farming and the\nfamily-raising yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to sign up,\" Karl pointed out. \"You could have applied\nfor a wife from some different planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"One's probably just as good as another. They'll all have to work the\nfarms and raise families.\"\n  \n \n  Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling\nup and headed into the thick forest."}
{"id":"THE_GIRLS_FROM_EARTH_2","contents":"It was quiet as Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail\nand he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making\nthat night. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to. And it\nwould be good to have somebody to help with the trapping and tanning,\nsomebody who could tend the small vegetable garden at the rear of his\nshack and mend his socks and wash his clothes and cook his meals.\n  \n \n  And it was time, he thought soberly, that he started to raise a family.\nHe was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children.\n  \n \n  \"You going to raise a litter, Joe?\"\n  \n \n  Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the\nsame thing.\n  \n \n  \"One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,\" Hill answered\ndefensively. \"Need some kids to cut the trees, a couple more to pole\nthem down the river, some to run the mill itself and maybe one to sell\nthe lumber in Landing City. Can't do it all myself.\"\n  \n \n  He paused a moment, thinking over something that had just occurred to\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"I've been thinking of your plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe I ought to\nhave one for my wife to take care of, too.\"\n  \n \n  Karl chuckled. \"I don't think she'll have the time!\"\n  \n \n  They left the leafy expanse of the forest and entered the grasslands\nthat sloped toward Landing City. He could even see Landing City itself\non the horizon, a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy\nstreets, and the small rocket port\u2014a scorched thirty acres or so\nfenced off with barbed wire.\n  \n \n  Karl looked out of the corner of his eye at Hill and felt a vague wave\nof uneasiness. Hill was a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and\nbristly stubble of a man who was used to living alone and who liked\nit. But once he took a wife, he would probably have to keep himself in\nclean clothes and shave every few days. It was even possible that the\nwoman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut.\n  \n \n  The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto the\nmain path from the small side trails.\n  \n \n  Hill broke the silence first. \"I wonder what they'll be like.\"\n  \n \n  Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly. \"They're Earthwomen, Joe.\n   \n   Earth!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  It was easy to act as though he had some inside information, but Karl\nhad to admit to himself that he actually knew very little about it. He\nwas a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman.\nHe had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage\nof them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket\noffice, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed\ndisturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted\nbroadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the\nstories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing\n   \n   definite\n   \n  to\noffer, no real facts at all.\n  \n \n  Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few\nmonths shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival\nspirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles\nfarther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet;\nand then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in\nyllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember.\n  \n \n  \"They say they're good workers,\" Hill said.\n  \n \n  Karl nodded. \"Pretty, too.\"\n  \n \n  They threaded their way through the crowded and muddy streets. Landing\nCity wasn't big, compared to some of the cities on Altair, where he had\nbeen raised, but Karl was proud of it. Some day it would be as big as\nany city on any planet\u2014maybe even have a population of ten thousand\npeople or more.\n  \n \n  \"Joe,\" Karl said suddenly, \"what's supposed to make women from Earth\nbetter than women from any other world?\"\n  \n \n  Hill located a faint itch and frowned. \"I don't know, Karl. It's hard\nto say. They're\u2014well, sophisticated, glamorous.\"\n  \n \n  Karl absorbed this in silence. Those particular qualities were, he\nthought, rather hard to define.\n  \n \n  The battered shack that served as rocket port office and headquarters\nfor the colonial office on Midplanet loomed up in front of them. There\nwas a crowd gathered in front of the building and they forced their way\nthrough to see what had caused it.\n  \n \n  \"We saw this the last time we were here,\" Hill said.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Karl agreed, \"but I want to take another look.\" He was\nanxious to glean all the information that he could.\n  \n \n  It was a poster of a beautiful woman leaning toward the viewer. The\nedges of the poster were curling and the colors had faded during the\nlast six months, but the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever.\nShe held a long-stemmed goblet in one hand and was blowing a kiss to\nher audience with the other. Her green eyes sparkled, her smile was\nprovocative. A quoted sentence read: \"I'm from\n   \n   Earth\n   \n  !\" There was\nnothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to\nwhich the colonial office was sending the women.\n  \n \n \n \n  She was real pretty, Karl thought. A little on the thin side, maybe,\nand the dress she was wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet,\nbut she had a certain something. Glamour, maybe?\n  \n \n  A loudspeaker blared.\n  \n \n  \"All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers!\nAll colonists....\"\n  \n \n  There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly\nmoving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out little\nblue slips with numbers on them, pausing every now and then to tell\nthem some entertaining bit of information about the women. He had a\ngreat imagination, nothing else.\n  \n \n  Karl drew the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the\nlanding field that had been decorated with bunting and huge welcome\nsigns for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with government\npamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went\nover and stuffed a few in his pockets. Other tables had been set out\nand were loaded with luncheon food, fixed by the few colonial women in\nthe community. Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wondering\nhow the girls from Earth would compare with them.\n  \n \n  He fingered the ticket in his pocket. What would the woman be like\nwho had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the rocket? For when it\nlanded, they would pair up by numbers. The method had its drawbacks, of\ncourse, but time was much too short to allow even a few days of getting\nacquainted. He'd have to get back to his trapping lines and he imagined\nthat Hill would have to get back to his sawmill and the others to their\nfarms. What the hell, you never knew what you were getting either way,\ntill it was too late.\n  \n \n  \"Sandwich, mister? Pop?\"\n  \n \n  Karl flipped the boy a coin, picked up some food and a drink, and\nwandered over to the landing field with Hill. There were still ten\nminutes or so to go before the rocket landed, but he caught himself\nstraining his sight at the blue sky, trying to see a telltale flicker\nof exhaust flame.\n  \n \n  The field was crowded and he caught some of the buzzing conversation.\n  \n \n  \"... never knew one myself, but let me tell you....\"\n  \n \n  \"... knew a fellow once who married one, never had a moment's rest\nafterward....\"\n  \n \n  \"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture....\"\n  \n \n  \"... I'd give a lot to know the girl who's got number twenty-five....\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's meet back here with the girls who have picked our numbers,\" Hill\nsaid. \"Maybe we could trade.\"\n  \n \n  Karl nodded, though privately he felt that the number system was just\nas good as depending on first impressions.\n  \n \n  There was a murmur from the crowd and he found his gaze riveted\noverhead. High above, in the misty blue sky, was a sudden twinkle of\nfire.\n  \n \n  He reached up and wiped his sweaty face with a muddy hand and brushed\naside a straggly lock of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt to try to look\nhis best.\n  \n \n  The twinkling fire came nearer.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"A Mr. Macdonald to see you, Mr. Escher.\"\n  \n \n  Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch.\n  \n \n  \"Please send him right in.\"\n  \n \n  That was entirely superfluous, he thought, because MacDonald would come\nin whether Escher wanted him to or not.\n  \n \n  The door opened and shut with a slightly harder bang than usual and\nEscher mentally braced himself. He had a good hunch what the problem\nwas going to be and why it was being thrown in their laps.\n  \n \n  MacDonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few minutes,\njust looking grim and not saying anything. Escher knew the psychology\nby heart. A short preliminary silence is always more effective in\nbrowbeating subordinates than an initial furious bluster.\n  \n \n  He lit a cigarette and tried to outwait MacDonald. It wasn't\neasy\u2014MacDonald had great staying powers, which was probably why he was\nthe head of the department.\n  \n \n  Escher gave in first. \"Okay, Mac, what's the trouble? What do we have\ntossed in our laps now?\"\n  \n \n  \"You know the one\u2014colonization problem. You know that when we first\nstarted to colonize, quite a large percentage of the male population\ntook to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers,\nthe frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to\nget away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome\nthan the female; the men left\u2014but the women didn't. At least, not in\nnearly the same large numbers.\n  \n \n  \"Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is\nnow something like five to three. If you don't know what that means,\nask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't\njust a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business\nand I'm not just using a literary phrase.\"\n  \n \n  He threw a paper on Escher's desk. \"You'll find most of the statistics\nabout it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to\nwomen. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's\nquite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a\nlot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they\nwouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?\"\n  \n \n  Escher shook his head blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Most of the girls in the past who didn't catch a husband,\" MacDonald\ncontinued, \"grew up to be the type of old maid who's dedicated to\nimproving the morals and what-not of the rest of the population. We've\ngot more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more\nsilly little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the\npokey for things like violating a woman's privacy\u2014whatever that\nmeans\u2014and she's the one who decides whether what you say or do is a\nviolation or not.\"\n  \n \n  Escher looked bored. \"Not to mention the new prohibition which\nforbids the use of alcohol in everything from cough medicines to hair\ntonics. Or the cleaned up moral code that reeks\u2014if you'll pardon the\nexpression\u2014of purity. Sure, I know what you mean. And you know the\nsolution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.\"\n  \n \n  MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair.\n  \n \n  \"But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your\nbaby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perpetual motion machines are,\" Escher said quietly. \"And pulling\nyourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless,\nwomen just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should\nthey give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern\nconveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored\nplanet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play\nfootsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them\nalive as not?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you advise I do, then?\" MacDonald demanded. \"Go back to the\nBoard and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of\nanything?\"\n  \n \n  Escher looked hurt. \"Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay\noff. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not\nnecessarily the spirit.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do they have to have a solution?\"\n  \n \n  \"As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the\nsituation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will\nhappen then won't be good.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, by then we'll have the answer.\"\n  \n \n  MacDonald stopped at the door. \"There's another reason why they want it\nworked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for\nemigration to the colony planets is falling off.\"\n  \n \n  \"How come?\"\n  \n \n  MacDonald smiled. \"On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to\nemigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?\"\n  \n \n  When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly\ntapped his fingers on the desk-top. It was lucky that the Colonization\nBoard worked on two levels. One was the well-publicized, idealistic\nlevel where nothing was too good and every deal was 99 and 44\/100 per\ncent pure. But when things got too difficult for it to handle on that\nlevel, they went to Escher and MacDonald's department. The coal mine\nlevel. Nothing was too low, so long as it worked. Of course, if it\ndidn't work, you took the lumps, too.\n  \n \n  He rummaged around in his drawer and found a list of the qualifications\nset up by the Board for potential colonists. He read the list slowly\nand frowned. You had to be physically fit for the rigors of space\ntravel, naturally, but some of the qualifications were obviously silly.\nYou couldn't guarantee physical perfection in the second generation,\nanyway.\n  \n \n  He tore the qualification list in shreds and dropped it in the disposal\nchute. That would have to be the first to go.\n  \n \n  There were other things that could be done immediately. For one thing,\nas it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize.\nObviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next.\n  \n \n  He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read\nit carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no\nsolution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would\nsolve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was\nstill enough.\n  \n \n  Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to\ncolonize who didn't\n   \n   want\n   \n  to colonize.\n  \n \n  The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second\npoint was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not.\n  \n \n  No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all\u2014provided you held your nose,\nsilenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was\nsuch a thing as a moral code.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the\ncorrespondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to\nbegin.\n  \n \n  She filed into the washroom with the other girls and carefully redid\nher face. It was getting hard to disguise the worry lines, to paint\naway the faint crow's-feet around her eyes.\n  \n \n  She wasn't, she admitted to herself for the thousandth time, what you\nwould call beautiful. She inspected herself carefully in her compact\nmirror. In a sudden flash of honesty, she had to admit that she wasn't\neven what you would call pretty. Her face was too broad, her nose a\nfraction too long, and her hair was dull. Not homely, exactly\u2014but not\npretty, either.\n  \n \n  Conversation hummed around her, most of it from the little group in the\ncorner, where the extreme few who were married sat as practically a\nrace apart. Their advice was sought, their suggestions avidly followed.\n  \n \n  \"Going out tonight, Phyl?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated a moment, then slowly painted on the rest of her mouth.\nThe question was technically a privacy violator, but she thought she\nwould sidestep it this time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank.\n  \n \n  \"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want to rinse\nout.\"\n  \n \n  The black-haired girl next to her nodded sympathetically. \"Sure, Phyl,\nI know what you mean. Just like the rest of us\u2014waiting for the phone\nto ring.\"\n  \n \n  Phyllis finished washing up and then left the office, carefully noting\nthe girl who was waiting for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard\nsort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's busty figure.\nWaiting for a plump, middle-aged man like a stagestruck kid outside a\ntheatre.\n  \n \n  At home, in her small two-room bachelor-girl apartment, she stripped\nand took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and toweled herself in\nfront of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You didn't know whether you\nshould keep yourself in trim just on some off-chance, or give up and\nlet yourself go.\n  \n \n  She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the dishes, and\nwent through the standard routine of getting a book and curling up on\nthe sofa. It was a good book of the boot-legged variety\u2014scientifically\nwritten with enough surplus heroes and heroines and lushly described\nlove affairs to hold anybody's interest.\n  \n \n  It held hers for ten pages and then she threw the book across the room,\ngetting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped and fluttered to\nthe floor.\n  \n \n  What was the use of kidding herself any longer, of trying to live\nvicariously and hoping that some day she would have a home and a\nhusband? She was thirty now; the phone hadn't rung in the last three\nyears. She might as well spend this evening as she had spent so many\nothers\u2014call up the girls for a bridge game and a little gossip, though\nheaven knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping\nabout.\n  \n \n  Perhaps she should have joined one of the organizations at the office\nthat did something like that seven nights out of every seven. A bridge\ngame or a benefit for some school or a talk on art. Or she could have\njoined the Lecture of the Week club, or the YWCA, or any one of the\nother government-sponsored clubs designed to fill the void in a woman's\nlife.\n  \n \n  But bridge games and benefits and lectures didn't take the place of a\nhusband and family. She was kidding herself again.\n  \n \n  She got up and retrieved the battered book, then went over to the mail\nslot. She hadn't had time to open her mail that morning; most of the\ntime it wasn't worth the effort. Advertisements for book clubs, lecture\nclubs, how to win at bridge and canasta....\n  \n \n  Her fingers sprang the metal tabs on a large envelope and she took out\nthe contents and spread it wide.\n  \n \n  She gasped. It was a large poster, about a yard square. A man was on\nit, straddling a tiny city and a small panorama of farms and forests\nat his feet. He was a handsome specimen, with wavy blond hair and blue\neyes and a curly mat on his bare chest that was just enough to be\nattractive without being apelike. He held an axe in his hands and was\neyeing her with a clearly inviting look of brazen self-confidence.\n  \n \n \n   It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the\nauthorities immediately!\n   \n \n \n  Bright lettering at the top of the poster shrieked: \"Come to the\nColonies, the Planets of Romance!\"\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Whoever had mailed it should be arrested and imprisoned! Preying\non....\n   \n \n \n  The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and figures.\nThe need for women out on the colony planets, the percentage of men to\nwomen\u2014a startling disproportion\u2014the comfortable cities that weren't\nnearly as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced\nqualifications.\n  \n \n  She caught herself admiring the man on the poster. Naturally, it was an\nartist's conception, but even so....\n  \n \n  And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, where\nyou had to battle disease and dirty savages.\n  \n \n  It was all a dream. She had never done anything like this and she\nwouldn't think of doing it now. And had any of her friends seen the\nposter? Of course, they probably wouldn't tell her even if they had.\n  \n \n \n   But the poster was a violation of privacy. Whoever had sent it had\ntaken advantage of information that was none of their business. It was\nup to her to notify the authorities!"}
{"id":"THE_GIRLS_FROM_EARTH_3","contents":"She took another look at the poster.\n  \n \n  The letter she finally finished writing was very short. She addressed\nit to the box number in the upper left-hand corner of the plain\nwrapper that the poster had come in.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The dress lay on the counter, a small corner of it trailing off the\nedge. It was a beautiful thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed in gold nylon\nthread. It was the kind of gown that would make anybody who wore it\nlook beautiful. The price was high, much too high for her to pay. She\nknew she would never be able to buy it.\n  \n \n  But she didn't intend to buy it.\n  \n \n  She looked casually around and noted that nobody was watching her.\nThere was another woman a few counters down and a man, obviously\nembarrassed, at the lingerie counter. Nobody else was in sight. It was\na perfect time. The clerk had left to look up a difficult item that she\nhad purposely asked for and probably wouldn't be back for five minutes.\n  \n \n  Time enough, at any rate.\n  \n \n  The dress was lying loose, so she didn't have to pry it off any\nhangers. She took another quick look around, then hurriedly bundled it\nup and dropped it in her shopping bag.\n  \n \n  She had taken two self-assured steps away from the counter when she\nfelt a hand on her shoulder. The grip was firm and muscular and she\nknew she had lost the game. She also knew that she had to play it out\nto the end, to grasp any straw.\n  \n \n  \"Let go of me!\" she ordered in a frostily offended voice.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, miss,\" the man said politely, \"but I think we have a short trip\nto take.\"\n  \n \n  She thought for a moment of brazening it out further and then gave up.\nShe'd get a few weeks or months in the local detention building, a\nprobing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted\nher to steal, and then she'd be out again.\n  \n \n  They couldn't do anything to her that mattered.\n  \n \n  She shrugged and followed the detective calmly. None of the shoppers\nhad looked up. None seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary.\n  \n \n  In the detention building she thanked her good luck that she was facing\na man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies\nwho served on the bench. She even found a certain satisfaction in the\npresence of the cigar smoke and the blunt, earthy language that floated\nin from the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you steal it?\" the judge asked. He held up the dress, which,\nshe noted furiously, didn't look nearly as nice as it had under the\ndepartment store lights.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have anything to say,\" she said. \"I want to see a lawyer.\"\n  \n \n  She could imagine what he was thinking. Another tough one, another\nplain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill.\n  \n \n  And she probably was. You had to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  nowadays. You couldn't\njust sit home and chew your fingernails, or run out and listen to the\nendless boring lectures on art and culture.\n  \n \n  \"Name?\" he asked in a tired voice.\n  \n \n  She knew the statistics he wanted. \"Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 pounds, brown\nhair and green eyes. Prints on file.\"\n  \n \n  The judge leaned down and mentioned something to the bailiff, who left\nand presently came back with a ledger. The judge opened it and ran his\nfingers down one of the pages.\n  \n \n  The sentence would probably be the usual, she thought\u2014six months and a\nfine, or perhaps a little more when they found out she had a record for\nshoplifting.\n  \n \n  A stranger in the courtroom in the official linens of the government\nsuddenly stepped up beside the judge and looked at the page. She could\nhear a little of what he said:\n  \n \n  \"... anxiety neurosis ... obvious feeling of not being wanted ...\nprobably steals to attract attention ... recommend emigration.\"\n  \n \n  \"In view of some complicating factors, we're going to give you a\nchoice,\" the judge finally said. \"You can either go to the penitentiary\nfor ten years and pay a $10,000 fine, or you can ship out to the colony\nplanets and receive a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus.\"\n  \n \n  She thought for a minute that she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand\ndollars and ten years! It was obvious that the state was interested in\nneither the fine nor in paying her room and board for ten years. She\ncould recognize a squeeze play when she saw it, but there was nothing\nshe could do about it.\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't call that a choice,\" she said sourly. \"I'll ship out.\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  Suzanne was proud of the apartment. It had all the modern conveniences,\nlike the needle shower with the perfume dispenser, the built-in\nsoft-drink bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the\nelectrical massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of\nsecurity in an ever-changing world.\n  \n \n  She lit a cigarette and chuckled. Mrs. Burger, the fat old landlady,\nthought she kept up the apartment by working as a buyer for one of the\ndowntown stores.\n  \n \n  Well, maybe some day she would.\n  \n \n  But not today. And not tonight.\n  \n \n  The phone rang and she answered in a casual tone. She talked for a\nminute, then let a trace of sultriness creep into her voice. The\nconversation wasn't long.\n  \n \n  She let the receiver fall back on the base and went into the bedroom to\nget a hat box. She wouldn't need much; she'd probably be back that same\nnight.\n  \n \n  It was a nice night and since the address was only a few blocks away,\nshe decided to walk it. She blithely ignored the curious stares from\nother pedestrians, attracted by the sharp, clicking sound of her heels\non the sidewalk.\n  \n \n  The address was a brownstone that looked more like an office building\nthan anything else, but then you could never tell. She pressed the\nbuzzer and waited a moment for the sound to echo back and forth on\nthe inside. She pressed it again and a moment later a suave young man\nappeared in the doorway.\n  \n \n  \"Miss Carstens?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled pertly.\n  \n \n  \"We've been expecting you.\"\n  \n \n  She wondered a little at the \"we,\" but dutifully smiled and followed\nhim in.\n  \n \n  The glare of the lights inside the office blinded her for a moment.\nWhen she could focus them again, her smile became slightly blurry at\nthe edges and then disappeared entirely. She wasn't alone. There was a\nbattery of chairs against one side of the room. She recognized most of\nthe girls sitting in them.\n  \n \n  She forced a smile to her lips and tried to laugh.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure there's been some mistake! Why, I never....\"\n  \n \n  The young man coughed politely. \"I'm afraid there's been no mistake.\nFull name, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suzanne Carstens,\" she said grimly, and gave the other statistics he\nwanted. She idly wondered what stoolie had peddled the phone numbers.\n  \n \n  \"Suzanne Carstens,\" the young man noted, and slowly shook his head.\n\"A very pretty name, but no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't\nmatter, though. Take a seat over there.\"\n  \n \n  She did as he asked and he faced the entire group.\n  \n \n  \"I and the other gentlemen here represent the Colonization Board. We've\ninterceded with the local authorities in order to offer you a choice.\nWe would like to ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will\npay you the standard emigration bonus of five hundred dollars. The\ncolonists need wives; they offer you\u2014security.\"\n  \n \n  He stressed the word slightly.\n  \n \n  \"Now, of course, if you don't prefer the colony planets, you can stay\nbehind and face the penalties of ten years in jail and a fine of ten\nthousand dollars.\"\n  \n \n  Suzanne felt that her lower jaw needed support. Ten thousand dollars\nand ten years! And in either case she'd lose the apartment she had\nworked so hard for, her symbol of security.\n  \n \n  \"Well, what do you say?\" There was a dead silence. The young man\nfrom the Colonization Board turned to Suzanne. \"How about you, Miss\nCarstens?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled sickly and nodded her head. \"I\n   \n   love\n   \n  to travel!\" she said.\n  \n \n  It didn't sound at all witty even to herself."}

YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while."}

This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it.

For a second her eyes seemed to expand till they preoccupied\nhis entire vision, till he could see nothing but their disturbingly\nclear\u2014and suddenly cold\u2014blueness.

Usually it required two or three days, and sometimes a\nweek, to reach the apartment phase. \"Fine,\" he said. \"When can I expect\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  She stood up and he got to his feet beside her. She was even taller\nthan he had thought. In fact, if he hadn't been wearing Cuban heels,\nshe'd have been taller than he was. \"I'll be in town night after next,\"\nshe said. \"Will nine o'clock be convenient for you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Perfectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good-by for now then, Mr. Quidley.\"\n  \n \n  He was so elated that when he arrived at his apartment he actually\ndid try to write a profile. His own, of course. He sat down at his\ncustom-built chrome-trimmed desk, inserted a blank sheet of paper in\nhis custom-built typewriter and tried to arrange his thoughts. But as\nusual his mind raced ahead of the moment, and he saw the title,\n   \n   Self\nProfile\n   \n  , nestling noticeably on the contents page of one of the Better\nMagazines, and presently he saw the piece itself in all its splendid\narray of colorful rhetoric, sparkling imagery and scintillating wit,\noccupying a two-page spread.\n  \n \n  It was some time before he returned to reality, and when he did the\nfirst thing that met his eyes was the uncompromisingly blank sheet of\npaper. Hurriedly he typed out a letter to his father, requesting an\nadvance on his allowance, then, after a tall glass of vintage wine, he\nwent to bed."}

Extensive research did not uncover\nany evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was\nwrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw\n  \n  it\n  \n hanging in the\ntown square.\n  \n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body."}
{"id":"THE_HANGING_STRANGER_2","contents":"\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce."}
{"id":"THE_HANGING_STRANGER_3","contents":"\"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured.\n  \n \n  \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me.\nBack there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through\ntraffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the\nseat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.\n  \n \n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Where?\" Loyce echoed.\n  \n \n  \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the\n   \n   basement\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame.\nWhy? What has that to do with\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Was anybody else down there with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from\none heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope.\n\"You mean because I was down there I missed\u2014the explanation? I didn't\nget in on it? Like everybody else?\"\n  \n \n  After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed\nthe explanation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it's official? The body\u2014it's\n   \n   supposed\n   \n  to be hanging there?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"\n  \n \n  Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them."}
{"id":"THE_HANGING_STRANGER_4","contents":"For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool\nof scummy water.\n  \n \n  They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n  \n \n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n  \n \n  Were there more of them?\n  \n \n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n  \n \n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n  \n \n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n  \n \n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n  \n \n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n  \n \n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n  \n \n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street."}
{"id":"THE_HANGING_STRANGER_5","contents":"Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired\nfaces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them\npaid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats,\njiggling with the motion of the bus.\n  \n \n  The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the\nsports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A\nbusinessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.\n  \n \n  Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a\npackage on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white angora sweater.\nGazing absently ahead of her.\n  \n \n  A high school boy in jeans and black jacket.\n  \n \n  A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with\npackages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness.\n  \n \n  Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to\ntheir families. To dinner.\n  \n \n  Going home\u2014with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask\nof an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their\ntown, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in\nhis cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked.\nThey had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.\n  \n \n  Maybe there were others.\n  \n \n  Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a\nmistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had\npassed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down.\nApparently their power-zone was limited.\n  \n \n  A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his\nchain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache.\nWell-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small\nhands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly\naway.\n  \n \n  Loyce tensed. One of\n   \n   them\n   \n  ? Or\u2014another they had missed?\n  \n \n  The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever.\nShrewd. A man too shrewd for them\u2014or one of the things itself, an alien\ninsect from beyond.\n  \n \n  The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into\nthe box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.\n  \n \n  The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second\nsomething passed between them.\n  \n \n  A look rich with meaning.\n  \n \n  Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step\ndown into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber\ndoor swung open.\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A\nresidential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him,\nthe bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet.\nThey were coming after him.\n  \n \n  Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against\nthe curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness.\nDesperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid\ndown again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.\n  \n \n  Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in\nthe gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed\nbefore him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.\n  \n \n  Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The\nman screamed and tried to roll away. \"\n   \n   Stop!\n   \n  For God's sake listen\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and\ndissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others\nwere there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk,\nup a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were\nbending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed\nman who had come after him.\n  \n \n  Had he made a mistake?\n  \n \n  But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out\u2014away from\nthem. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between\ntheir world and his."}

And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out.\nSickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of\nmotion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy.\nIt was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse\u2014the thing hurtling at him,\ncold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow\nT-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange\nhalf-turn of its body as it reached him.

It\nbounced against the wall and fluttered down.\n  \n \n  Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien\nmind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his\nown, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence,\nsettling over him\u2014and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a\nbroken heap on the rug.\n  \n \n  It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of\nsome kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy.... He closed his mind\ntight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his\nknife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still,\nneither of them moving.\n  \n \n  The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It\nwas ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and\nopen fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.\n  \n \n  Loyce opened the door.

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about\nfour miles,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" he said."}
{"id":"The_Happy_Castaway_2","contents":"Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space\nship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They\nwere the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he\nrealized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown\nof concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\n  \n \n  On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward\nthem.\n  \n \n  She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her\nstomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared\nafter her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\n  \n \n  He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like\nhe was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled\nafter the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I\ndidn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which\nleads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach\nthe hills we'll be safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was\nwrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head\nforemost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,\nwinced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the\nhills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n  \n \n  \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could\nget around in the hills.\"\n  \n \n  The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a\ngorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon\nof sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the\ncrevices and floor of the canyon.\n  \n \n  They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped\naway, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her\narm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied\nit to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded\nhim. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\n  \n \n  The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more\nprecipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the\nuniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette\npackage, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we\nwere here.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the\nfreighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her\ngrip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship.\nI don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley\ntobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on\nGanymede.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly\ndetached her hand.\n  \n \n  The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from\nunder her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\n  \n \n  A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\""}
{"id":"The_Happy_Castaway_3","contents":"He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward\nthem from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was\nbarefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around\nher sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her\nbrown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table\ncloth at one time in its history.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a\nman!\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n  \n \n  \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\n  \n \n  A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off\nwarily.\n  \n \n  Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way\nhe had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the\ncanyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the\nbend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer\nweight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up\nbodily, started up the canyon chanting: \"\n   \n   He was a rocket riding daddy\nfrom Mars.\n   \n  \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\n  \n \n  Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the\nspaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had\nbeen broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of\nhis left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,\ntough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from\nmortification.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being\nheld aloft by four barbarous young women.\n  \n \n  \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a\nbreak.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between\ntwo husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease\nwith which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light\nweight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the\nplains. He wished he was a centaur.\n  \n \n  The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan\npicked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised\none of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow\nledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from\nunder him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment\nhe thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,\nhauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a\nrope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top\nlike a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\n  \n \n  The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking\nthe prairie.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\n  \n \n  A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,\nJonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up\nthey resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to\nhis own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes."}
{"id":"The_Happy_Castaway_4","contents":"The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who\nreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they\nhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly\nlike the neighing of horses.\n  \n \n  Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem\nof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred\nto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's\nmoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to\nthe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty\ntimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\n  \n \n  At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults\nback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls\nresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.\nThe brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome\nfellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\n  \n \n  They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep\nvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees\nalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of\nthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\n  \n \n  They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind\na promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming\nordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew\nthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp\nlike a bag of meal.\n  \n \n  The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner\nreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded\nand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded\nhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He\nlooked away hastily.\n  \n \n  Someone hailed them from the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\n  \n \n  A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She\nhad green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n  \n \n  \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could\nlook so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered\nlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt\nlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\n  \n \n  A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of\nthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him\nappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him\ninto the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\n  \n \n  He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the\nwrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of\nthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His\nfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the\nThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang\nforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be\nseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like\na captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar\nsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan\nFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild\nwomen."}

Directly across the table sat a striking,\ngrey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She\nlooked to him like a stenographer.

He returned his\ngaze to his plate.\n  \n \n  Olga said: \"Hey, Sultan.\"\n  \n \n  He shuddered, but looked up questioningly.\n  \n \n  She said, \"How's the fish?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he mumbled between a mouthful. \"Where did you get it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Caught it,\" said Olga. \"The stream's full of 'em.

And the table was in an uproar.\n  \n \n  The rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table\nuntil the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was\ncalled Billy.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. \"Let him be. He can't\ngo anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck.

He shifted position in embarrassment. The\nmovement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering\nlassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.\n  \n \n  \"You look exhausted,\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. \"Just tired,\" he\nmumbled. \"Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.\" Indeed\nit was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His\neyelids drooped lower and lower.\n  \n \n  \"First it's tobacco,\" said Olga; \"now he wants to sleep.

We'll have to\ncut them off.\"\n  \n \n  At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cut off whose feet?\n   \n  \" he cried in alarm.\n  \n \n  \"Not your feet, silly,\" said Ann. \"Your boots.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lay a hand on those boots,\" he scowled; \"and I'll make me another pair\nout of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.\" Having delivered\nhimself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.\n  \n \n  Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. \"And this,\" she cried \"is what\nwe've been praying for during the last three years.\"\n  \n \n  The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a\ncane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced\nall around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he\npresumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits\nand berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He\nwalked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be\nhanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.\n  \n \n  He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by\ntwenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it\noff in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the\nshade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be\nyears before they were rescued.\n  \n \n  As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join\nthe centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains\non the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was\nambling toward him.\n  \n \n  \"How's the invalid?\" she said, seating herself beside him.\n  \n \n  \"Hot, isn't it?\" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the\nflat of her hand on his chest and shoved. \"\n   \n   Ooof!\n   \n  \" he grunted. He sat\ndown rather more forcibly than he had risen.\n  \n \n  \"Don't get up because of me,\" she informed him. \"It's my turn to cook,\nbut I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do\nyou know that you are irresistible?\" She seized his shoulders, stared\ninto his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a\nhungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow\nwith his sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"Suppose the rest should come,\" he said in an embarrassed voice.\n  \n \n  \"They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your\neyes,\" she said, \"are like deep mysterious pools.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure enough?\" said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began to\nrecover his nerve.\n  \n \n  She said, \"You're the best looking thing.\" She rumpled his hair. \"I\ncan't keep my eyes off you.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. \"Ouch!\" He winced. He had\nforgotten his sore muscles.\n  \n \n  \"I forgot,\" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.\n\"You're hurt.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled her back down. \"Not so you could notice it,\" he grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. \"We're\n   \n   all\n   \n  glad to hear that!\""}
{"id":"The_Happy_Castaway_7","contents":"Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked\naround. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their\nfeatures were grim. He said: \"I don't feel so well after all.\"\n  \n \n  \"It don't wash,\" said Billy. \"It's time for a showdown.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take\nher stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a\nmenacing angle. She said in an angry voice: \"He's mine. I found him.\nLeave him alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where do you get that stuff?\" cried Olga. \"Share and share alike, say\nI.\"\n  \n \n  \"We could draw straws for him,\" suggested the green-eyed blonde.\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Jonathan broke in. \"I've got some say in the matter.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have not,\" snapped Billy. \"You'll do just as we say.\" She took a\nstep toward him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan edged away in consternation.\n  \n \n  \"He's going to run!\" Olga shouted.\n  \n \n  Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the\nplain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing\nrelaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes\nat the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.\n  \n \n  At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,\nhe scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space\nship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and\ntore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the\nwreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription\nin silver letters: \"INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.\"\n  \n \n  Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in\nsurprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray\nRifle in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Jonathan Fawkes,\" said the castaway as he panted up, \"pilot for\nUniversal. I was wrecked.\"\n  \n \n  A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed\nmustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a\nyellow composition holder. He said, \"I'm Doctor Boynton.\" He had a\nrich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. \"We are members of the\nInterstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a\ncursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.\nFawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning\nwhen we sighted the wreck.\"\n  \n \n  \"I say,\" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,\nenergetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun\ngingerly, respectfully. \"We're a week overdue now,\" he said. \"If you\nhave any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd\nbest be getting them aboard.\""}

There isn\u2019t\nanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters\nnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\nloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s\npart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\nwedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe\nshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.\nEveryone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no\nexception.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming\nin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\nfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have\nproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t\nsolve.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one\nsingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll\nbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\nall those mysteries. I met you when the whole\nvalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\nby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\nnot me. He was the hero without even meaning to\nbe. He was the one who rode through town and\nwarned people that the flood was coming. I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper."}
{"id":"The_Haunted_Fountain_3","contents":"id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n  \n If Wishes Came True\n  \n  \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested."}
{"id":"The_Haunted_Fountain_4","contents":"id=\"chap03\">\n  CHAPTER III\n  \n A Strange Encounter\n  \n  Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\ntrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\nit under one condition. They were not to drive all\nthe way to the house which, she said, was just over\nthe hilltop. They were to park the car where no\none would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.\nShe and Lois both argued that it would be better to\ninquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n  \n \n  \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it\nlooks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they\nstarted off in the blue car she was driving.\n  \n \n  It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\neasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\nand said if they did find the fountain she thought\nshe\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said\nabout wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you\nlet people know about them instead of muttering\nthem to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know\nabout this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\nbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\ncoat he gave me last year.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too\nwarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\ntrip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\nas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\nhad covered the distance that had seemed such a\nlong way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s\nwagon.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve\njust about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t\nthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\nto pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\nqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s\nold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t\nexplain what happened afterwards. When I woke\nup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\nwagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to\nsee how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Again she broke off as if there were something\nshe wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\nwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\nbut you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d\nLorraine reminded her.\n  \n \n  \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,\nbut it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember\ndriving home along this road. You see, I thought my\ngrandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\nand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\nThere wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next\nhill,\u201d Lois put in.\n  \n \n  \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I\ncouldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\ntower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\nI followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in\nthe woods that always tempts me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\nyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where\nthe hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d\nJudy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes\npeered out at me from unexpected places. I was\nactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\nThere wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard\nthe rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he\nwas driving off without me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,\nand Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like\nthat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\nand wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\n\u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\nthem, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for\nMrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they\nturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n  \n \n  \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s\nanother car coming.\u201d\n  \n \n  As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\nducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\nJudy until the car had passed. The man driving\nit was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\nhis hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\nlong time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\nmost of his hair.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois\nwhen the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for\nplaying hide and seek?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine\nbegged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there\nany more.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\ncan\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.\n  \n \n  She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\nmore about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\n  \n \n  Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\nroad. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\nof rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\ngreen next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\nThe sky was gray with white clouds being driven\nacross it by the wind.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can\nsee it over to the left. It looks like something out of\nGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder\nwhat it is.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It\nwould be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut\nif there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give\nus permission.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy\nsuggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends\nas Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\nroad. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to\nexplore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for\nthe fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf\nyou know anything about the people who live here\nnow, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\nI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do\nknow who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember\nRoger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?\nI\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have\nacquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on\nthe estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you\ntell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places\ntogether.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\n\u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a\ncar of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger\nBanning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better\nthan that. I did know him slightly, but not from\nschool. The boys and girls were separated and went\nto different high schools by the time we moved to\n  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\nlot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at\nchurch.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer\nmention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\nto gossip.\n  \n \n  \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\nhis father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\nbusiness people. I think he forged some legal\ndocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\nIt was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.\n  \n \n  Now Judy did remember. It was something she\nwould have preferred to forget. She liked to think\nshe was a good judge of character, and she had taken\nDick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\nnever stoop to crime.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d\nLois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look\nfor it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I\njust like to know what a tiger looks like before he\nsprings at me,\u201d Judy explained.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition\nof ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who\nseems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.\n  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve\nseen that character who drove down this road and,\nfor some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\nWhy, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\nevasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private\nestates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\n\u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect\nwe\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\nof trespassing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two\ndark-coated figures strode down the road toward\nthem. \u201cYou drove right by a\n  NO TRESPASSING\n  sign,\nand this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to\nmeet us!\u201d"}

He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one."}
{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_2","contents":"With Jacobs and Anhauser and the remainder of the crew of the ship,\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , seven judges sat in a semi-circle and Bruce stood there in\nfront of them for the inquest.\n  \n \n  In the middle of the half-moon of inquisition, with his long legs\nstretched out and his hands folded on his belly, sat Captain Terrence.\nHis uniform was black. On his arm was the silver fist insignia of the\nConqueror Corps. Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there\nwas no emotion at all on her trim, neat face.\n  \n \n  He remembered her as she had been years ago, but at the moment he\nwasn't looking very hard to see anything on her face. It was too late.\nThey had gotten her young and it was too late.\n  \n \n  Terrence's big, square face frowned a little. Bruce was aware suddenly\nof the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastilene\nshelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes that had come to him in\nhis dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he\nhad been when he woke from them.\n  \n \n  \"This is a mere formality,\" Terrence finally said, \"since we all know\nyou killed Lieutenant Doran a few hours ago. Marsha saw you kill him.\nWhatever you say goes on the record, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"For whom?\" Bruce asked.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of question is that? For the authorities on Earth when we\nget back.\"\n  \n \n  \"When you get back? Like the crews of those other four ships out\nthere?\" Bruce laughed without much humor.\n  \n \n  Terrence rubbed a palm across his lips, dropped the hand quickly again\nto his belly. \"You want to make a statement or not? You shot Doran in\nthe head with a rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted\nenough of my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior.\nThis is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've said too\nmuch, and done too much. Freedom doesn't allow you to go around killing\nfellow crew-members!\"\n  \n \n  \"Any idea that there was any democracy or freedom left died on Venus,\"\nBruce said.\n  \n \n  \"Now we get another lecture!\" Terrence exploded. He leaned forward.\n\"You're sick, Bruce. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never\nhave sent you on this trip. We need strength, all the strength we can\nfind. You don't belong here.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce agreed indifferently. \"I was drafted for this trip. I\ntold them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part\nof it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you\nbacked down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devil\ndoes Venus\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his high\nforehead. \"Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to\nthe Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly\neducated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people.\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't heard it,\" Terrence admitted. \"What injustice?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce said, \"I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice\nany longer. Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the\ncrew of that first ship to hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One\nof the New Era's more infamous dates. Drexel says the Venusians were\naborigines. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this\nvillage. No one knows how old it was. There were intelligent beings\nthere. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand\ninhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet\nus. Without even an attempt at communication, they were wiped out. The\nvillage was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning\nto run down his face. He took a deep breath and stood there before the\ncold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Bruce said. \"I apologize. None of you know what I'm talking\nabout.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded. \"You're psycho. It's as simple as that. They pick the\nmost capable for these conquests. Even the flights are processes of\nelimination. Eventually we get the very best, the most resilient, the\nreal conquering blood. You just don't pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you\nthink gives you the right to stand here in judgment against the laws\nof the whole Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are plenty on Earth who agree with me,\" Bruce said. \"I can say\nwhat I think now because you can't do more than kill me and you'll do\nthat regardless....\"\n  \n \n  He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And theirs. They\nhad established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The\npsychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had done that. If you didn't\nwant to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human\nvacuum tube, you kept your mouth shut. And for many, when the mouth was\nkept shut long enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted\nto open the mouth for in the first place.\n  \n \n  A minority in both segments of a world split into two factions.\nBoth had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, for\ncenturies, clung to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism,\nindividualism. To most, the words had no meaning now. It was a question\nof which set of conquering heroes could conquer the most space first.\nSo far, only Venus had fallen. They had done a good, thorough job\nthere. Four ships had come to Mars and their crews had disappeared.\nThis was the fifth attempt\u2014"}
{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_3","contents":"Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n  \n \n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\""}
{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_4","contents":"Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams."}
{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_5","contents":"The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to\nworry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence\nwas saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His\ndream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had\nleft it, and it was the same\u2014allowing even for the time difference\nnecessitated by his periods of sleep.\n  \n \n  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n  \n \n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n  \n \n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n  \n \n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n  \n \n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n  \n \n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n  \n \n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n   \n   is\n   \n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n  \n \n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain?

{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_6","contents":"He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the\nmike.

You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down?

The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain."}
{"id":"THE_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN_7","contents":"For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and\nhe was ashamed of what he had felt.

Suggestion so deep and strong that it\nseems real to one human or a million or a billion; there's no limit to\nthe number that can be influenced. What the people who came off those\nships saw wasn't real.

He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands.

She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight.

{"id":"The_Holes_and_John_Smith_3","contents":"From the entrance of\n   \n   The\nSpace Room\n   \n  came a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\n  \n \n  The fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\n  \n \n  His pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\n  \n \n  The bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\n  \n \n  A moment's silence.\n  \n \n  \"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n  \n \n  \"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n \n  My gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\n   \n   On An Asteroid\nWith You\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know\n   \n   everything\n   \n  ,\" said John\nSmith.\n  \n \n  I turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\n  \n \n  And I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\n  \n \n  My eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\n  \n \n  The tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\n  \n \n  First they went\n   \n   Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n   \n  ,\nand then,\n   \n   boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n   \n  ,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\n  \n \n  But there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\n  \n \n  I glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\n  \n \n  I looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\n  \n \n  We finished\n   \n   On An Asteroid With\nYou\n   \n  , modulated into\n   \n   Sweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\n   \n  and finished with\n   \n   Tighten Your Lips on Titan\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  We waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n  \n \n  \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  . This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\n  \n \n  I wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\n  \n \n  He turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought."}

We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n  \n \n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n  \n \n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment.

{"id":"the_hoofer_2","contents":"They all\n  knew he was a spacer\nbecause of the white goggle marks\non his sun-scorched face, and so\nthey tolerated him and helped him.\nThey even made allowances for him\nwhen he staggered and fell in the\naisle of the bus while pursuing the\nharassed little housewife from seat\nto seat and cajoling her to sit and\ntalk with him.\n  \n \n  Having fallen, he decided to\nsleep in the aisle. Two men helped\nhim to the back of the bus, dumped\nhim on the rear seat, and tucked his\ngin bottle safely out of sight. After\nall, he had not seen Earth for nine\nmonths, and judging by the crusted\nmatter about his eyelids, he couldn't\nhave seen it too well now, even if\nhe had been sober. Glare-blindness,\ngravity-legs, and agoraphobia were\nexcuses for a lot of things, when a\nman was just back from Big Bottomless.\nAnd who could blame a\nman for acting strangely?\n  \n \n  Minutes later, he was back up the\naisle and swaying giddily over the\nlittle housewife. \"How!\" he said.\n\"Me Chief Broken Wing. You\nwanta Indian wrestle?\"\n  \n \n  The girl, who sat nervously staring\nat him, smiled wanly, and\nshook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he\nburbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n  \n \n  The two men slid out of their\nseats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's\ngo back to bed.\"\n  \n \n  \"My name's Hogey,\" he said.\n\"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding\nabout being a Indian.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a\ndrink.\" They got him on his feet,\nand led him stumbling back down\nthe aisle.\n  \n \n  \"My ma was half Cherokee, see?\nThat's how come I said it. You\nwanta hear a war whoop? Real\nstuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind.\"\n  \n \n  He cupped his hands to his\nmouth and favored them with a\nblood-curdling proof of his ancestry,\nwhile the female passengers\nstirred restlessly and hunched in\ntheir seats. The driver stopped the\nbus and went back to warn him\nagainst any further display. The\ndriver flashed a deputy's badge and\nthreatened to turn him over to a\nconstable.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey\ntold him. \"I got me a son now,\nthat's why. You know? A little\nbaby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen\nhim yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you just sit still and be\nquiet then, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Big Hogey nodded emphatically.\n\"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to\nmake any trouble.\"\n  \n \n  When the bus started again, he\nfell on his side and lay still. He\nmade retching sounds for a time,\nthen rested, snoring softly. The bus\ndriver woke him again at Caine's\njunction, retrieved his gin bottle\nfrom behind the seat, and helped\nhim down the aisle and out of the\nbus.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey stumbled about for a\nmoment, then sat down hard in the\ngravel at the shoulder of the road.\nThe driver paused with one foot on\nthe step, looking around. There was\nnot even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building\nnext to the railroad track, a couple\nof farmhouses at the edge of a side-road,\nand, just across the way, a deserted\nfilling station with a sagging\nroof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey got up and staggered\naround in front of the bus, clutching\nat it for support, losing his\nduffle bag.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The\ndriver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted\naround after his troublesome passenger,\ntaking his arm as he sagged\nagain. \"You crossing?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme\nalone, I'm okay.\"\n  \n \n  The driver started across the\nhighway with him. The traffic was\nsparse, but fast and dangerous in\nthe central ninety-mile lane.\n  \n \n  \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting.\n\"I'm a tumbler, ya know?\nGravity's got me. Damn gravity.\nI'm not used to gravity, ya know? I\nused to be a tumbler\u2014\n   \n   huk!\n   \n  \u2014only\nnow I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count\nof li'l Hogey.

I bet you\ngotta son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two kids,\" said the driver,\ncatching Hogey's bag as it slipped\nfrom his shoulder. \"Both girls.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, you oughta be home with\nthem kids. Man oughta stick with\nhis family. You oughta get another\njob.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly,\nwaggled a moralistic finger, skidded\non the gravel as they stepped\nonto the opposite shoulder, and\nsprawled again.\n  \n \n  The driver blew a weary breath,\nlooked down at him, and shook his\nhead. Maybe it'd be kinder to find\na constable after all. This guy could\nget himself killed, wandering\naround loose.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody supposed to meet\nyou?\" he asked, squinting around\nat the dusty hills.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Huk!\n   \n  \u2014who, me?\" Hogey giggled,\nbelched, and shook his head.\n\"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming.\nS'prise. I'm supposed to be here a\nweek ago.\" He looked up at the\ndriver with a pained expression.\n\"Week late, ya know? Marie's\ngonna be sore\u2014woo-\n   \n   hoo\n   \n  !\u2014is she\ngonna be sore!\" He waggled his\nhead severely at the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Which way are you going?\" the\ndriver grunted impatiently.\n  \n \n  Hogey pointed down the side-road\nthat led back into the hills.\n\"Marie's pop's place. You know\nwhere? 'Bout three miles from\nhere. Gotta walk, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" the driver warned.\n\"You sit there by the culvert till\nyou get a ride. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  Hogey nodded forlornly.\n  \n \n  \"Now stay out of the road,\" the\ndriver warned, then hurried back\nacross the highway. Moments later,\nthe atomic battery-driven motors\ndroned mournfully, and the bus\npulled away.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing\nthe back of his neck. \"Nice\npeople,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people.\nAll hoofers.\"\n  \n \n  With a grunt and a lurch, he got\nto his feet, but his legs wouldn't\nwork right. With his tumbler's reflexes,\nhe fought to right himself\nwith frantic arm motions, but gravity\nclaimed him, and he went stumbling\ninto the ditch.\n  \n \n  \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\"\nhe cried.\n  \n \n  The bottom of the ditch was wet,\nand he crawled up the embankment\nwith mud-soaked knees, and sat on\nthe shoulder again. The gin bottle\nwas still intact. He had himself a\nlong fiery drink, and it warmed him\ndeep down. He blinked around at\nthe gaunt and treeless land.\n  \n \n  The sun was almost down, forge-red\non a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked\nsky faded into sulphurous\nyellow toward the zenith, and the\nvery air that hung over the land\nseemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n  \n \n  A farm truck turned onto the\nside-road and moaned away, its\ndriver hardly glancing at the dark\nyoung man who sat swaying on his\nduffle bag near the culvert. Hogey\nscarcely noticed the vehicle. He just\nkept staring at the crazy sun.\n  \n \n  He shook his head. It wasn't really\nthe sun. The sun, the real sun,\nwas a hateful eye-sizzling horror in\nthe dead black pit. It painted everything\nwith pure white pain, and you\nsaw things by the reflected pain-light.\nThe fat red sun was strictly a\nphoney, and it didn't fool him any.\nHe hated it for what he knew it was\nbehind the gory mask, and for what\nit had done to his eyes.\n  \n \n \n  With a grunt, he got to his feet,\nmanaged to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of\nthe farm road, lurching from side\nto side, and keeping his eyes on the\nrolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n  \n \n  Hogey tried to turn around to\nlook at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went\ndown on the pavement. The car's\ntires screeched on the hot asphalt.\nHogey lay there for a moment,\ngroaning. That one had hurt his\nhip. A car door slammed and a big\nman with a florid face got out and\nstalked toward him, looking angry.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell's the matter with\nyou, fella?\" he drawled. \"You\nsoused? Man, you've really got a\nload.\"\n  \n \n  Hogey got up doggedly, shaking\nhis head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't\nstand the gravity.\"\n  \n \n  The burly farmer retrieved his\ngin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\"\nhe grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest,\nI'm just space burned. You\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway?\nDo you live around here?\"\n  \n \n  It was obvious that the big man\nhad taken him for a hobo or a\ntramp. Hogey pulled himself together.\n\"Goin' to the Hauptman's\nplace. Marie. You know Marie?\"\n  \n \n  The farmer's eyebrows went up.\n\"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know\nher. Only she's Marie Parker now.\nHas been, nigh on six years. Say\u2014\"\nHe paused, then gaped. \"You ain't\nher husband by any chance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey\nParker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be\u2014! Get in the car.\nI'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no\nshape to walk it.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly, waggled his\nhead, and helped Hogey and his\nbag into the back seat. A woman\nwith a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly\nbeside the farmer in the front,\nand she neither greeted the passenger\nnor looked around.\n  \n \n  \"They don't make cars like this\nanymore,\" the farmer called over\nthe growl of the ancient gasoline\nengine and the grind of gears.\n\"You can have them new atomics\nwith their loads of hot isotopes\nunder the seat. Ain't safe, I say\u2014eh,\nMartha?\"\n  \n \n  The woman with the sun-baked\nneck quivered her head slightly.\n\"A car like this was good enough\nfor Pa, an' I reckon it's good\nenough for us,\" she drawled mournfully.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the car drew\nin to the side of the road. \"Reckon\nyou can walk it from here,\" the\nfarmer said. \"That's Hauptman's\nroad just up ahead.\"\n  \n \n  He helped Hogey out of the car\nand drove away without looking\nback to see if Hogey stayed on his\nfeet. The woman with the sun-baked\nneck was suddenly talking\ngarrulously in his direction.\n  \n \n  It was twilight. The sun had set,\nand the yellow sky was turning\ngray. Hogey was too tired to go on,\nand his legs would no longer hold\nhim. He blinked around at the land,\ngot his eyes focused, and found\nwhat looked like Hauptman's place\non a distant hillside. It was a big\nframe house surrounded by a wheatfield,\nand a few scrawny trees. Having\nlocated it, he stretched out in\nthe tall grass beyond the ditch to\ntake a little rest.\n  \n \n  Somewhere dogs were barking,\nand a cricket sang creaking monotony\nin the grass. Once there was the\ndistant thunder of a rocket blast\nfrom the launching station six miles\nto the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past\non the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n  \n \n  When he awoke, it was night,\nand he was shivering. His stomach\nwas screeching, and his nerves dancing\nwith high voltages. He sat up\nand groped for his watch, then remembered\nhe had pawned it after\nthe poker game. Remembering the\ngame and the results of the game\nmade him wince and bite his lip\nand grope for the bottle again.\n  \n \n  He sat breathing heavily for a\nmoment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become\nsecond nature with him, but he had\nto think for a moment because his\ndefective vision prevented him from\nseeing the Earth-crescent.\n  \n \n  Vega was almost straight above\nhim in the late August sky, so he\nknew it wasn't much after sundown\u2014probably\nabout eight o'clock. He\nbraced himself with another swallow\nof gin, picked himself up and\ngot back to the road, feeling a little\nsobered after the nap.\n  \n \n  He limped on up the pavement\nand turned left at the narrow drive\nthat led between barbed-wire fences\ntoward the Hauptman farmhouse,\nfive hundred yards or so from the\nfarm road. The fields on his left\nbelonged to Marie's father, he\nknew. He was getting close\u2014close\nto home and woman and child.\n  \n \n  He dropped the bag suddenly\nand leaned against a fence post,\nrolling his head on his forearms\nand choking in spasms of air. He\nwas shaking all over, and his belly\nwrithed. He wanted to turn and\nrun. He wanted to crawl out in the\ngrass and hide.\n  \n \n  What were they going to say?\nAnd Marie, Marie most of all.\nHow was he going to tell her about\nthe money?\n  \n \n  Six hitches in space, and every\ntime the promise had been the\nsame:\n   \n   One more tour, baby, and\nwe'll have enough dough, and then\nI'll quit for good. One more time,\nand we'll have our stake\u2014enough\nto open a little business, or buy a\nhouse with a mortgage and get a\njob.\n   \n \n \n  And she had waited, but the\nmoney had never been quite enough\nuntil this time. This time the tour\nhad lasted nine months, and he had\nsigned on for every run from station\nto moon-base to pick up the\nbonuses. And this time he'd made\nit. Two weeks ago, there had been\nforty-eight hundred in the bank.\nAnd now ...\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" he groaned, striking his\nforehead against his forearms. His\narm slipped, and his head hit the\ntop of the fencepost, and the pain\nblinded him for a moment. He staggered\nback into the road with a\nlow roar, wiped blood from his\nforehead, and savagely kicked his\nbag.\n  \n \n  It rolled a couple of yards up the\nroad. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished\nwith it, he stood panting and angry,\nbut feeling better. He shouldered\nthe bag and hiked on toward the\nfarmhouse.\n  \n \n  They're hoofers, that's all\u2014just\nan Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A\nborn tumbler. Know what that\nmeans? It means\u2014God, what does\nit mean? It means out in Big Bottomless,\nwhere Earth's like a fat\nmoon with fuzzy mold growing on\nit. Mold, that's all you are, just\nmold.\n  \n \n  A dog barked, and he wondered\nif he had been muttering aloud. He\ncame to a fence-gap and paused in\nthe darkness. The road wound\naround and came up the hill in\nfront of the house. Maybe they were\nsitting on the porch. Maybe they'd\nalready heard him coming. Maybe ...\n  \n \n  He was trembling again. He\nfished the fifth of gin out of his\ncoat pocket and sloshed it. Still over\nhalf a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a\nbottle sticking out of his pocket.\nHe stood there in the night wind,\nsipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The\nmoon looked as phoney as the\nsetting sun.\n  \n \n  He straightened in sudden determination.\nIt had to be sometime.\nGet it over with, get it over with\nnow. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly\nbehind him. He retrieved his bag,\nand waded quietly through the tall\ngrass until he reached the hedge\nwhich divided an area of sickly\npeach trees from the field. He got\nover the hedge somehow, and started\nthrough the trees toward the\nhouse. He stumbled over some old\nboards, and they clattered.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Shhh!\n   \n  \" he hissed, and moved\non.\n  \n \n  The dogs were barking angrily,\nand he heard a screen door slam.\nHe stopped.\n  \n \n  \"Ho there!\" a male voice called\nexperimentally from the house.\n  \n \n  One of Marie's brothers. Hogey\nstood frozen in the shadow of a\npeach tree, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Anybody out there?\" the man\ncalled again.\n  \n \n  Hogey waited, then heard the\nman muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic\n'im.\"\n  \n \n  The hound's bark became eager.\nThe animal came chasing down the\nslope, and stopped ten feet away to\ncrouch and bark frantically at the\nshadow in the gloom. He knew the\ndog.\n  \n \n  \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky\nboy\u2014here!\"\n  \n \n  The dog stopped barking, sniffed,\ntrotted closer, and went\n\"\n   \n   Rrrooff!\n   \n  \" Then he started sniffing\nsuspiciously again.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he\nwhispered.\n  \n \n  The dog came forward silently,\nsniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around\nHogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The\nman whistled from the porch. The\ndog froze, then trotted quickly back\nup the slope.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the\nman on the porch said. \"Chasin'\narmadillos again, eh?\"\n  \n \n  The screen door slammed again,\nand the porch light went out.\nHogey stood there staring, unable\nto think. Somewhere beyond the\nwindow lights were\u2014his woman,\nhis son.\n  \n \n  What the hell was a tumbler doing\nwith a woman and a son?\n  \n \n  After perhaps a minute, he stepped\nforward again. He tripped over\na shovel, and his foot plunged into\nsomething that went\n   \n   squelch\n   \n  and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle.\nHe fell forward into a heap of\nsand, and his foot went deeper into\nthe sloppy wetness.\n  \n \n  He lay there with his stinging\nforehead on his arms, cursing softly\nand crying. Finally he rolled\nover, pulled his foot out of the\nmess, and took off his shoes. They\nwere full of mud\u2014sticky sandy\nmud.\n  \n \n  The dark world was reeling\nabout him, and the wind was dragging\nat his breath. He fell back\nagainst the sand pile and let his\nfeet sink in the mud hole and wriggled\nhis toes. He was laughing\nsoundlessly, and his face was wet\nin the wind. He couldn't think. He\ncouldn't remember where he was\nand why, and he stopped caring,\nand after a while he felt better.\n  \n \n  The stars were swimming over\nhim, dancing crazily, and the mud\ncooled his feet, and the sand was\nsoft behind him. He saw a rocket\ngo up on a tail of flame from the\nstation, and waited for the sound of\nits blast, but he was already asleep\nwhen it came.\n  \n \n  It was far past midnight when he\nbecame conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He\npushed the animal away with a low\ncurse and mopped at the side of his\nface. He stirred, and groaned. His\nfeet were burning up! He tried to\npull them toward him, but they\nwouldn't budge. There was something\nwrong with his legs.\n  \n \n  For an instant he stared wildly\naround in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his\neyes and shuddered. When he\nopened them again, the moon had\nemerged from behind a cloud, and\nhe could see clearly the cruel trap\ninto which he had accidentally\nstumbled. A pile of old boards, a\ncareful stack of new lumber, a\npick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps\nof fresh-turned earth, and a concrete\nmixer\u2014well, it added up.\n  \n \n  He gripped his ankles and pulled,\nbut his feet wouldn't budge. In\nsudden terror, he tried to stand up,\nbut his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in\nthe sand with a low moan. He lay\nstill for several minutes, considering\ncarefully.\n  \n \n  He pulled at his left foot. It was\nlocked in a vise. He tugged even\nmore desperately at his right foot.\nIt was equally immovable.\n  \n \n  He sat up with a whimper and\nclawed at the rough concrete until\nhis nails tore and his fingertips\nbled. The surface still felt damp,\nbut it had hardened while he slept.\n  \n \n  He sat there stunned until Hooky\nbegan licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and\ndug his hands into the sand-pile to\nstop the bleeding. Hooky licked at\nhis face, panting love.\n  \n \n  \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n  \n \n  The dog whined softly, trotted\na short distance away, circled, and\ncame back to crouch down in the\nsand directly before Hogey, inching\nforward experimentally.\n  \n \n  Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry\nsand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the\nsky. They came to rest on the sliver\nof light\u2014the space station\u2014rising\nin the west, floating out in Big Bottomless\nwhere the gang was\u2014Nichols\nand Guerrera and Lavrenti\nand Fats. And he wasn't forgetting\nKeesey, the rookie who'd replaced\nhim.\n  \n \n  Keesey would have a rough time\nfor a while\u2014rough as a cob. The pit\nwas no playground. The first time\nyou went out of the station in a\nsuit, the pit got you. Everything\nwas falling, and you fell, with it.\nEverything. The skeletons of steel,\nthe tire-shaped station, the spheres\nand docks and nightmare shapes\u2014all\ntied together by umbilical cables\nand flexible tubes. Like some crazy\nsea-thing they seemed, floating in a\nblack ocean with its tentacles bound\ntogether by drifting strands in the\ndark tide that bore it.\n  \n \n \n  Everything was pain-bright or\ndead black, and it wheeled around\nyou, and you went nuts trying to\nfigure which way was down. In fact,\nit took you months to teach your\nbody that\n   \n   all\n   \n  ways were down and\nthat the pit was bottomless.\n  \n \n  He became conscious of a plaintive\nsound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  It was a baby crying.\n  \n \n  It was nearly a minute before he\ngot the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking\nfrantically at his encased feet\nand sobbing low in his throat.\nThey'd hear him if he kept that up.\nHe stopped and covered his ears to\nclose out the cry of his firstborn.

Space was\na disease, and he had it.\n  \n \n  \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly.\n\"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n  \n \n  He knew he was yelling hysterically\nat the sky and fighting the relentless\nconcrete that clutched his\nfeet, and after a moment he stopped.\n  \n \n  The light was on in the house\nagain, and he heard faint sounds.\nThe stirring-about woke the baby\nagain, and once more the infant's\nwail came on the breeze.\n  \n \n \n   Make the kid shut up, make the\nkid shut up ...\n   \n \n \n  But that was no good. It wasn't\nthe kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space,\nthey said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had\nonly himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change\nanything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n  \n \n  A tumbler had no business with a\nfamily, but what was a man going\nto do? Take a skinning knife, boy,\nand make yourself a eunuch. But\nthat was no good either. They needed\nbulls out there in the pit, not\nsteers. And when a man came down\nfrom a year's hitch, what was he\ngoing to do? Live in a lonely shack\nand read books for kicks? Because\nyou were a man, you sought out a\nwoman. And because she was a\nwoman, she got a kid, and that was\nthe end of it. It was nobody's fault,\nnobody's at all.\n  \n \n  He stared at the red eye of Mars\nlow in the southwest. They were\nrunning out there now, and next\nyear he would have been on the\nlong long run ...\n  \n \n  But there was no use thinking\nabout it.

You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way\nLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when\nshe said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and\napprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n  \n \n  \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other\nagain, of course, but only from a distance.

There was too damn much Terran\ninfluence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n  \n \n  No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple\nsomersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she\nthe high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this\nbefore, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed\nby impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could\ncarry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses\nwere not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra\nwas now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.\nHowever, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he\nwas forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the\nsmooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n  \n \n  \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high\npriest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here\nqualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in\nthese arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have\nthe right to question them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,\nwhirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages\nwhich were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of\nthis planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to\nutilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of\nall and now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break\nup things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some\ntime.\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke\nhim into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of\nthe chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and\nBbulas had been thoroughly terranized.\n  \n \n \n   I hate Terrestrials\n   \n  , Skkiru said to himself.\n   \n   I hate Terra.\n   \n  The\nquiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling\nin his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were\nto break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final\nhumiliation.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her\nfiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused\nall such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the\nplanet, had received her education at the local university. Although\nsound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor\nin the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had\nsome sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are\nbehaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n  \n \n  \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a\npatience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no\nidea of who was to become my high priestess.

So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I\nsuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the\nground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n  \n \n  \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh,\n   \n   pooh\n   \n  , POOH!\"\n  \n \n  Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru!

I shall make the religious life my career.\nAre there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n  \n \n  \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if\nyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a\ntrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly\nwith the high priestess's robes.\"\n  \n \n  Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart\nfrom mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,\neven though my heart will be breaking.\"\n  \n \n  It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the\nwhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's\nproblem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered\ndown from overhead. It was too late.\n  \n \n  \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.\n\"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n  \n \n  Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had\nmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\""}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_4","contents":"Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n  \n \n  \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n  \n \n  That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n  \n \n  \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n  \n \n  \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n  \n \n  \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even\n   \n   beg\n   \n  . But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n  \n \n  All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n  \n \n  Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_5","contents":"\"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans\ndescended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a\nprocession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes,\nand singing a popular ballad\u2014to which less ribald, as well as less\ninspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just\nin case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a\nsmattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to\nnavigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n  \n \n  \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar.\nHis teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been\ncustom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor\u2014now a pariah,\nof course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers\u2014and\nthe wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the\ndemolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the\nplanet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when\ntaking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport,\nhaving previously found it unnecessary\u2014but now both air-cars and\nself-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently\nprimitive.\n  \n \n  The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly\nin the wet season or\u2014more properly speaking on Snaddra\u2014the wetter\nseason. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals\nworn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much\ngood, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the\nprivileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their\ncostumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case\nof the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be\nhumanoid.\n  \n \n  As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once\ngotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had\nalways planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to\u2014the\nweather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more\ncomfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure\nhours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which\nhe'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment\u2014and it was the\nmatter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way,\nand get it.\n  \n \n  Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in\nhis toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land\ntransport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked\nso well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the\nEarth ship long before the official greeters had reached it."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_6","contents":"The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly\npasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae\ndistinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much\nas the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n  \n \n  In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,\nentirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow\nexpected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had\nfrequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those\ncould be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had\nalways understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving\nbeyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which\nthe Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to\nunderstand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable\nthird language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen\none since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on\nthat little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,\nthat's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more\nthan a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to\namass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried\nto eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully\nthat it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How\nhorrible!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another\nspecies entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it\nwas quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral\nconsiderations seemed less important to us than self-preservation\njust then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the\nmissionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n  \n \n  \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,\nwell, it's all in the day's work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with\na polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming\nprocession\u2014\n   \n   creatures indeed\n   \n  ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would\nbe indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially\nsince this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the\nshoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n  \n \n  Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of\nBbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which\nhad always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent\nlife-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it\nwasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n  \n \n  \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with\nan appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the\nprocessional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some\nslight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three\neyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my\nfavorite color.\"\n  \n \n \n   If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn\nbright yellow.\n   \n  His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal\nhealthy emerald to a sickly celadon."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_7","contents":"Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion\nof his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere.\n   \n   Maybe the\nlittle one's a robot!\n   \n  However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better\nconstructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n  \n \n  \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport\nwith the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n  \n \n  Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap\nsomething for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of\nexchange here?\"\n  \n \n \n   Money\n   \n  , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this\npiece of information, helpful though it would be.\n  \n \n  \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.\n\"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be\na universal one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs\nof gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the\nplanet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate\nwere to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift\nto contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his\nrocker.\n  \n \n  To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,\nSkkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's\nresistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much\nweather all at once.\n  \n \n  On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they\noften sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem\nof birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed\nno such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was\ndwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the\nchocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than\nto descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_8","contents":"Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,\nmomentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.\nFor one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously\nupon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle\naffair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the\nofficial reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,\nbecause of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from\novershooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at\nhim\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both\nsides, too.\n  \n \n  Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no\nmatter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he\nwasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand\nsegregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic\nthought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars\nwere often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since\nmetal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the\nplanet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the\neasy way out.\n  \n \n  Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high\npriest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were\nvolcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the\nwind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the\nsnug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were\nmetal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\n  \n \n  As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\n  \n \n  The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n  \n \n  \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....\"\n  \n \n  Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n  \n \n  \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.\""}

After a slight start, Cyril went on,\napparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n  \n \n  \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and\nprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive\nanalysis of your culture as painless as possible.

Such texture, such color,\nsuch aroma!\"\n  \n \n  Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing\nas mud....\"\n  \n \n  The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable\nTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a\ndance to bring on rain. It is a dance to\n   \n   stop\n   \n  rain.\"\n  \n \n  He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,\nthat was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.\nIn the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for\nthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than\nthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned\nthe various roles so that each person would be making a definite\ncontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,\nlike the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n  \n \n  What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing\naround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?\nOnly the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw\nthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried\naway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been\naccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_10","contents":"Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled\nhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been\nso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.\nIt gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,\nalthough, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have\nto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's\npatriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die\nfor his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the\nresult of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n  \n \n  All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off\nto the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for\none of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist\nmiserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The\ncapital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow\nsuit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep\nthe Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n  \n \n  He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of\nthem, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing\nthe game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n  \n \n  As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which\nstruck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed\nto help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that\nthemselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put\nout centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired\nfrom a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far\ntoo high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and\nmuch more cheaply.\n  \n \n  It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had\nbeen forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.\nWhat resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from\nminerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All\nlife-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and\nrice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a\nTerran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the\nother planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of\nthe direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay\naltogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in."}
{"id":"The_Ignoble_Savages_11","contents":"The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service\njob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to\nthe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general\ngloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring\nsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,\nwas where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n  \n \n  The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No\nindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how\ngreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so\nimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason\nwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at\nthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the\npopulation.\n  \n \n  The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve\nthe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former\nPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the\nfact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,\nafter considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method\nof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,\nhad come up with this program.\n  \n \n  It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he\nfelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the\nBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,\nlargely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,\nas a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the\nstatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of\nthe planet, there was no choice.\n  \n \n  But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his\nanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one\nprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was\nnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies\nwhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in\nlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are\nthose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some\nold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of\ncollecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave\nall the thinking to me!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly."}

I had finished reading the\n   \n   Chronicle\n   \n  , folded and put\nit beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the\nSan Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I\nreturned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed\ngray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats\nbefore me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.\n  \n \n  I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now\nshe had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and\ncalf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a\nwindow where there was nothing to see.\n  \n \n  I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a\ntogetherness-type-magazine reader.\n  \n \n  Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I\nshould be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles\nfor, and not wanting to.\n  \n \n  So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps\nthat sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever\ncomplained.\n  \n \n  It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore\nthe insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers\nand\u2014well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.\nIt's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from\nelectric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me\n   \n   how\n   \n  they hurt.\n  \n \n  Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always\nknew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and\ntherefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel\nthe color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the\nsame as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell\nif there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just\nthe feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to\nbecome pretty good at guessing.\n  \n \n  Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object\nin her purse with waxlike stuff inside it\u2014a lipstick. A round, hard\nobject with dust inside\u2014a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small\nbook, probably an address book, money in a change purse\u2014a few bills\nand coins. Not much else.\n  \n \n  I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.\nBut I never say anything."}
{"id":"THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_2","contents":"I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when\nMiss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat\nmy sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some\nof the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.\nLunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd\nbe gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during\nher absence, which I dutifully did.\n  \n \n  Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for\nher favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and\nlooking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while\nshe was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which\nshe always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's in your purse,\" I blurted out.\n  \n \n  I was sent home with a stinging note.\n  \n \n  Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able\nto sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other\npeople are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.\n  \n \n  I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but\nhow? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the\nthings I sense in probing really are.\n  \n \n  But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A\nfeather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or\nheat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's\nwindow. And I can stop clocks.\n  \n \n  Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty\nbecause I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco\nInternational Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it\nseems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement\nand balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last\ntime I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the\npawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its\ndelicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting\ninfluence to decrease the restoring torque.\n  \n \n  The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite\na bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I\ncan't stand the alarm.\n  \n \n  When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went\nto Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls\nand cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate\nabout a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped\nquite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.\n  \n \n  So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that\nit amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.\n  \n \n  The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out\nthe window. \"Where are we?\" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her\nwe were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, \"Oh,\" glanced\nat her wristwatch and sank back again.\n  \n \n  Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I\ncontented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about\nAmos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement\nchain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were\nmaybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind\nwandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of\nluggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through\nslips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a\nukulele.\n  \n \n  I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first.\n  \n \n \n \n  The bomb was in a small bag\u2014a woman's bag judging by the soft,\nflimsy things you'd never find in a man's\u2014and I didn't know it was a\nbomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,\nquiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me\nwas that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be\nelectrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more\nclosely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard\nround cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my\nneck when I suddenly realized what it was.\n  \n \n  The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past\nthe train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own\nalarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.\n  \n \n  It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.\n  \n \n  My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around\nat the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I\nthought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was\nthere. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.\nWe'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles\nsoon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.\n  \n \n  But of course that had been the plan!\n  \n \n  My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind\nwas numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd\nthink I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be\npanic and they'd never get the plane down in time\u2014if they believed me.\n  \n \n  \"Sir.\" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,\nsmiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small\npaper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped\ndoughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a\nnapkin.\n  \n \n  I goggled at her, managed to croak, \"No, thanks.\" She gave me an odd\nlook and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at\nthe cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent\na frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that\nbalance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried\nto close everything off\u2014the throb of engines, the rush of air, the\nwoman sipping coffee noisily beside me\u2014and I went into the clock and\nsurrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;\nwhen it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was\nlike trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going\nto be able to stop it.\n  \n \n  Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not\nafford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold\nuntil it came to a dead stop.\n  \n \n  \"Anything the matter?\"\n  \n \n  My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to\nme. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was\nstill chewing.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" I said, letting out my breath. \"I'm all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back\nand forth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Must have been dreaming,\" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When\nshe came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,\njust coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy\nwith sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good."}
{"id":"THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_3","contents":"All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to\nthe landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would\nstart again.

And then what? My secret would be out and my life would\nbe changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man\nliterally with gimlet eyes.\n  \n \n  Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of\nthe city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,\nbut there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it\nwas also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n  \n \n  To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing\nmy eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging\nand pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n  \n \n  A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n  \n \n  \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n  \n \n  I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I\nlooked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took\nit without a word and went away.\n  \n \n  \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to\nfits, but I didn't.\n  \n \n  It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest\nminutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when\nthe plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n  \n \n  Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as\nunconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking\nthrough the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I\nhad my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.\nSo I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and\nwatch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield\ncarts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n  \n \n  It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained\nthe bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The\nassortment of bags\u2014a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors\u2014was\npacked in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where\nI was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the\nbalance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a\nramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded\nand placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n  \n \n  There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,\nand a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to\ndetermine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was\nthe attendant and I had two bags\u2014my own battered veteran of years, and\na fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n  \n \n  I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and\u2014a\nclock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n  \n \n  I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward\nand grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I\nentered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to\nimmobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes."}
{"id":"THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_4","contents":"The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I\nstared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented\nit to him.

I glanced ever so casually toward the\nremaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\nhe was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n  \n \n  I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n  \n \n  He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\nand put my suitcase on the stone steps there.

A member of the airport police detail. I could\ntell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\nwhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\nacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\nI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\ncounter out of the side of my eye.\n  \n \n  The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\nto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\ninside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\non the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\nclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n  \n \n  I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\nmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\ncounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\nhad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\nclock again.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n  \n \n  \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n  \n \n  I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\ncounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the\ndevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel\nescaped my grasp.\n  \n \n  \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n  \n \n  I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood\nthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand\nshe had a green baggage claim check.\n  \n \n  The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight\ncase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,\nglanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying\nafter her."}

I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.\n  \n \n  \"Joe did,\" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but\nstaring vacantly across the room. \"Joe put it there.\" Behind her eyes\nshe was reliving some recent scene.\n  \n \n  \"Who is Joe?\"\n  \n \n  \"My husband.\" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got\ncontrol again. \"This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my\nsister.\" Her smile was bleak. \"I see now why he wanted to put in those\nbooks. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put\nin some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when he\nmust have put the\u2014put it in there.\"\n  \n \n  I said gently, \"Why would he want to do a thing like that?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\" She shook her head. \"I just don't know.\" And she was\nclose to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, \"I'm not sure I\nwant to know.\" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right now?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  I nodded. \"As long as we don't move it.\"\n  \n \n  I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been\nthinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the\nairport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said her\nname was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was a\nbomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried\nbecause she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it\nwould have to do.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to get it deactivated,\" I said, watching the fat man pay for\nhis coffee and leave. \"The sooner the better.\""}
{"id":"THE_LITTLE_RED_BAG_6","contents":"I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.\nI asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other\npeople had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy\nfor a long while.\n  \n \n  \"She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.\nShe said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab.\" She smiled\na little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all\nfor me. \"That's where I was going when you caught up with me.\"\n  \n \n  It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again\nwhen we reached the lobby.\n  \n \n  The two bags weren't there.\n  \n \n  I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.\n  \n \n  \"See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered\nsuitcase?\"\n  \n \n  \"Bag? Suitcase?\" he mumbled. Then he became excited. \"Why, a man just\nstepped out of here\u2014\" He turned to look down the street. \"That's him.\"\n  \n \n  The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,\nmine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" I shouted, starting toward him.\n  \n \n  The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came\nabreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door\nand threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.\n  \n \n  The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I\nreached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then\nwalked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the\nredcap, who said, \"That man steal them suitcases?\"\n  \n \n  \"That he did,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the\nparking lot. Redcap said, \"Better tell him about it.\"\n  \n \n  The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, \"We'd better get\nover to the office.\"\n  \n \n  But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant\nshattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.\n  \n \n  \"Jets,\" the redcap said, eying the sky.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" the policeman said. \"Didn't sound much like a jet to\nme.\"\n  \n \n  We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe\nin the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That\nwas all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was\nthinking.\n  \n \n  She said, \"About those bags,\" and looked at me.\n  \n \n  The officer said, \"Yes, miss?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I feel the same way,\" I said. \"Would it be all right if we didn't\nbother to report it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" the policeman said, \"I can't\n   \n   make\n   \n  you report it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd rather not then,\" Julia said. She turned to me. \"I'd like some\nair. Can't we walk a little?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" I said.\n  \n \n  We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill\nwith the distant sounds of sirens."}

One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house.

I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged.

The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\""}

A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts.

He wanted a good time, true;\nbut he wanted it solo. The main cabaret was too crowded; he passed\nthrough it and another equally blatant room wherein twoscore Venusians\nwere straining the structure with a native \"sing-stomp,\" and ended up\nfinally, with a sigh of relief, in a small, dimly-lighted private bar\nunfrequented by anyone save a bored and listless Martian bartender.\n  \n \n  The chrysanthemum-pated son of the desertland roused himself as Chip\nentered, rustled his petals and piped a ready greeting.\n  \n \n  \"Welcoom, ssirr!

Johnny was dead.\n  \n \n  A snarl of sheer animal rage burst from Chip's lips. Someone would pay\nfor this; pay dearly! Help was coming now. He himself would lead the\nhue-and-cry that would track a foul murderer to his lair. He spun as\nthe footsteps drew nearer.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry!\" he cried. \"This way! Follow me\u2014\"\n  \n \n  In a bound, he hurdled the bar, lingered at the door only long enough\nto let the others mark his course. For they had burst into the room,\nnow, a full score of them. Excited, hard-bitten dogs of space,\nquick-triggered and willing. Once more he cried for help.\n  \n \n  \"After him! Come on! He\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And then\u2014disaster struck! For a reedy voice broke from the van of the\nmob. The voice of the Martian bartender.\n  \n \n  \"That's him!\" he piped sibilantly. \"That's the man! He's a desperate\ncriminal, wanted on four planets for murder! The Patrolman came to\narrest him\u2014\n   \n   and now he's murdered the Spacie\n   \n  !\""}

For a split second he stood motionless in the doorway,\ngaping lips forming denial. Words which were never to be uttered, for\nsuddenly a raw-boned miner wrenched a Moeller from its holster, leveled\nand fired.\n  \n \n  The hot tongue of death licked hungrily at the young spaceman's cheek,\nscorched air crackled in his eardrums. Now was no time to squander\nin vain argument. Chip ducked, spun, and hurled himself through the\ndoorway. There still remained one hope. That he might catch the real\nmurderer, and in that way clear himself....\n  \n \n  But the door led to a small, deserted vestibule, and it to an alleyway\nbehind Xu'ul's Solarest. Viewing that maze of byways and passages, Chip\nknew his hope was futile. There remained but one thing to do. Get out\nof here. But quick!\n  \n \n  It was no hard task. The labyrinth swallowed him as it had engulfed the\nscarred killer; in a few minutes even the footsteps of his pursuers\ncould no longer be heard. And Chip worked his cautious way back to the\nspaceport, and to the bin wherein was cradled the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer looked up in surprise as Chip let himself in the\nelectro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, \"Salvation, look what the cat\ndrug in! His high-flying Nibs! What's the matter, Chip? Night-life too\nmuch for you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that now!\" panted Chip. \"Is this tin can ready to roll?\nWarm the hypos.

The gushing orange spume of a spaceship roaring from its\ncradle. \"Hurry, Syd!\"\n  \n \n  There were a lot of things Syd Palmer wanted to ask. He wanted to know\n   \n   who\n   \n  went\n   \n   where\n   \n  ; he was bursting with curiosity about the \"important\nbusiness\" which had brought his pal back from town in such a rush; his\nkeen eye also had detected a needle-gun burn on Chip's coat-sleeve. But\nhe was too good a companion to waste time now on such trivia.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he snapped. \"It's your pigeon!\"\n  \n \n  And he disappeared. They heard his voice calling to the workmen, the\nscuff of equipment being disengaged from the\n   \n   Chickadee's\n   \n  hull, the\nthin, high whine of warming hypatomics. Salvation looked at Warren\nquizzically.\n  \n \n  \"It smells,\" he ventured gently, \"like trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is trouble,\" Chip told him. \"Plenty trouble!\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case\u2014\" said the old man mildly\u2014\"I guess I'd better get the\nrotor stripped for action.\" He stepped to the gunnery turret, dropped\nthe fore-irons and stripped their weapon for action. \"'Be ye men of\npeace,'\" he intoned, \"'but gird firmly thy loins for righteous battle!'\nThus saith the Lord God which is Jehovah. Selah!\"\n  \n \n  Then came Syd's cry from the depths of the hyporoom.\n  \n \n  \"All set, Chip! Lift gravs!\"\n  \n \n  Warren's finger found a stud. And with a gusty roar the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  rocketed into space on a pillar of flame."}

If so, you'd\nbetter keep a weather-eye peeled.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before,\nbut he knew of the Bog by hearsay. All men did. A treacherous region of\ntightly packed asteroids, a mad and whirling scramble of the gigantic\nrocks which, aeons ago, had been a planet. Few spacemen dared penetrate\nthe Bog. Of those who did dare, few returned to tell the tale. \"The\nBog! Say! I'd\n   \n   better\n   \n  keep a sharp lookout!\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  once more, fastened an eye to its lens.

The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n  \n \n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy\nof motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused\nthemselves to the nonmetallic tube casing.\n  \n \n  In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular\ndriver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent\nsearing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment\nbefore the main circuit breakers could clack open.\n  \n \n  The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering\na delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see\nagain soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had\nlost its usual ruddiness.\n  \n \n  Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in\nthe zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n  \n \n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n  \n \n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n  \n \n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n  \n \n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   There's metal in the field!\n   \n  \" His voice was high and unsteady."}

From the outside.\"\n  \n \n  Several of the men swore under their breaths. Interplanetary space\nwas constantly bombarded, with an intensity inverse to the prevailing\ngravitation, by something called Sigma radiation. Man had never\nencountered it until leaving Earth, and little was known of it\nexcept that short exposure killed test animals and left their bodies\nunpredictably altered.\n  \n \n  Inside the ship it was safe enough, for the sleek hull was charged with\na Kendall power-shield, impervious to nearly any Sigma concentration.\nBut the shielding devices in the emergency spacesuits were small\nand had never been space-tested in a region of nearly equalized\ngravitations.\n  \n \n  The man who emerged from the airlock would be flipping a coin with a\nparticularly unpleasant form of death.\n  \n \n  Many pairs of eyes turned toward Robson Hind. He was jet chief.\n  \n \n  \"I'm assigned, not expendable,\" he protested hastily. \"If there were\nmore trouble later....\" His face was pasty.\n  \n \n  Assigned. That was the key word.

His lean body,\nbuilt more for quick, neatly coordinated action than brute power,\nbalanced handily in the zero gravity as he ran one hand through his\nsandy hair in a gesture of uncertainty.\n  \n \n  He knew that not even the captain would order him through the airlock.\n  \n \n  But the members of the Five Ship Plan had been selected in part for a\nsense of responsibility.\n  \n \n  \"Nick, will you help me button up?\" he asked with forced calmness.\n  \n \n  For an instant he thought he detected a sly gleam in Hind's eyes. But\nthen the jet chief was pressing forward with the others to shake his\nhand.\n  \n \n  Rebellious reluctance flared briefly in Barry's mind. Dorothy Voorhees\nhad refused to make a definite promise before blasting off in Three\u2014in\nfact he hadn't even seen her during her last few days on Earth.

When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations."}
{"id":"THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_4","contents":"Barry opened his eyes. The ship was in normal deceleration and Nick\nPodtiaguine was watching him from a nearby bunk.\n  \n \n  \"I could eat a cow with the smallpox,\" Barry declared.\n  \n \n  Nick grinned. \"No doubt. You slept around the clock and more. Nice job\nof work out there.\"\n  \n \n  Barry unhitched his straps and sat up.\n  \n \n  \"Say,\" he asked anxiously. \"What's haywire with the air?\"\n  \n \n  Nick looked startled. \"Nothing. Everything checked out when I came off\nwatch a few minutes ago.\"\n  \n \n  Barry shrugged. \"Probably just me. Guess I'll go see if I can mooch a\nhandout.\"\n  \n \n  He found himself a hero. The cook was ready to turn the galley inside\nout while a radio engineer and an entomologist hovered near to wait on\nhim. But he couldn't enjoy the meal. The sensations of heat and dryness\nhe had noticed on awakening grew steadily worse. It became difficult to\nbreathe.\n  \n \n  He started to rise, and abruptly the room swirled and darkened around\nhim. Even as he sank into unconsciousness he knew the answer.\n  \n \n  The suit's Kendall-shield had leaked!\n  \n \n  Four plunged toward Venus tail first, the Hoskins jets flaring ahead.\nThe single doctor for the Colony had gone out in Two and the crewmen\ntrained in first aid could do little to relieve Barry's distress.\nFainting spells alternated with fever and delirium and an unquenchable\nthirst. His breathing became increasingly difficult.\n  \n \n  A few thousand miles out Four picked up a microbeam. A feeling of\nexultation surged through the ship as Captain Reno passed the word, for\nthe beam meant that some Earthmen were alive upon Venus. They were not\nnecessarily diving straight toward oblivion. Barry, sick as he was,\nfelt the thrill of the unknown world that lay ahead.\n  \n \n  Into a miles-thick layer of opacity Four roared, with Captain Reno\nhimself jockeying throttles to keep it balanced on its self-created\nsupport of flame.\n  \n \n  \"You're almost in,\" a voice chanted into his headphones through\ncrackling, sizzling static. \"Easy toward spherical one-thirty. Hold it!\nLower. Lower. CUT YOUR POWER!\"\n  \n \n  The heavy hull dropped sickeningly, struck with a mushy thud, settled,\nsteadied.\n  \n \n  Barry was weak, but with Nick Podtiaguine steadying him he was waiting\nwith the others when Captain Reno gave the last order.\n  \n \n  \"Airlock open. Both doors.\"\n  \n \n  Venusian air poured in.\n  \n \n  \"For this I left Panama?\" one of the men yelped.\n  \n \n  \"Enough to gag a maggot,\" another agreed with hand to nose.\n  \n \n  It was like mid-summer noon in a tropical mangrove swamp, hot and\nunbearably humid and overpowering with the stench of decaying\nvegetation.\n  \n \n  But Barry took one deep breath, then another. The stabbing needles in\nhis chest blunted, and the choking band around his throat loosened.\n  \n \n  The outer door swung wide. He blinked, and a shift in the encompassing\nvapors gave him his first sight of a world bathed in subdued light.\n  \n \n  Four had landed in a marsh with the midships lock only a few feet above\na quagmire surface still steaming from the final rocket blast. Nearby\nthe identical hulls of Two and Three stood upright in the mud. The\nmist shifted again and beyond the swamp he could see the low, rounded\noutlines of the collapsible buildings Two and Three had carried in\ntheir cargo pits. They were set on a rock ledge rising a few feet out\nof the marsh. The Colony!\n  \n \n  Men were tossing sections of lattice duckboard out upon the swamp,\nextending a narrow walkway toward Four's airlock, and within a few\nminutes the new arrivals were scrambling down.\n  \n \n  Barry paid little attention to the noisy greetings and excited talk.\nImpatiently he trotted toward the rock ledge, searching for one\nparticular figure among the men and women who waited.\n  \n \n  \"Dorothy!\" he said fervently.\n  \n \n  Then his arms were around her and she was responding to his kiss.\n  \n \n  Then unexpected pain tore at his chest. Her lovely face took on an\nexpression of fright even as it wavered and grew dim. The last thing he\nsaw was Robson Hind looming beside her.\n  \n \n  By the glow of an overhead tubelight he recognized the kindly, deeply\nlined features of the man bending over him. Dr. Carl Jensen, specialist\nin tropical diseases. He tried to sit up but the doctor laid a\nrestraining hand on his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Water!\" Barry croaked.\n  \n \n  The doctor held out a glass. Then his eyes widened incredulously as his\npatient deliberately drew in a breath while drinking, sucking water\ndirectly into his lungs.\n  \n \n  \"Doctor,\" he asked, keeping his voice low to spare his throat. \"What\nare my chances? On the level.\"\n  \n \n  Dr. Jensen shook his head thoughtfully. \"There's not a thing\u2014not a\ndamned solitary thing\u2014I can do. It's something new to medical science.\"\n  \n \n  Barry lay still.\n  \n \n  \"Your body is undergoing certain radical changes,\" the doctor\ncontinued, \"and you know as much\u2014more about your condition than I do.\nIf a normal person who took water into his lungs that way didn't die of\na coughing spasm, congestive pneumonia would get him sure. But it seems\nto give you relief.\"\n  \n \n  Barry scratched his neck, where a thickened, darkening patch on each\nside itched infuriatingly.\n  \n \n  \"What are these changes?\" he asked. \"What's this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Those things seem to be\u2014\" the doctor began hesitantly. \"Damn it, I\nknow it sounds crazy but they're rudimentary gills.\"\n  \n \n  Barry accepted the outrageous statement unemotionally. He was beyond\nshock.\n  \n \n  \"But there must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Pain struck again, so intense his body twisted and arched\ninvoluntarily. Then the prick of a needle brought merciful oblivion.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Barry's mind was working furiously. The changes the Sigma radiations\nhad inflicted upon his body might reverse themselves spontaneously, Dr.\nJensen had mentioned during a second visit\u2014but for that to happen he\nmust remain alive. That meant easing all possible strains.\n  \n \n  When the doctor came in again Barry asked him to find Nick Podtiaguine.\nWithin a few minutes the mechanic appeared.\n  \n \n  \"Cheez, it's good to see you, Barry,\" he began.\n  \n \n  \"Stuff it,\" the sick man interrupted. \"I want favors. Can do?\"\n  \n \n  Nick nodded vigorously.\n  \n \n  \"First cut that air conditioner and get the window open.\"\n  \n \n  Nick stared as though he were demented, but obeyed, unbolting the heavy\nplastic window panel and lifting it aside. He made a face at the damp,\nmalodorous Venusian air but to Barry it brought relief.\n  \n \n  It was not enough, but it indicated he was on the right track. And he\nwas not an engineer for nothing.\n  \n \n  \"Got a pencil?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  He drew only a rough sketch, for Nick was far too competent to need\ndetailed drawings.\n  \n \n  \"Think you can get materials?\"\n  \n \n  Nick glanced at the sketch. \"Hell, man, for you I can get anything the\nColony has. You saved Four and everybody knows it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two days?\"\n  \n \n  Nick looked insulted.\n  \n \n  He was back in eight hours, and with him came a dozen helpers. A\npower line and water tube were run through the metal partition to the\ncorridor, connections were made, and the machine Barry had sketched was\nready.\n  \n \n  Nick flipped the switch. The thing whined shrilly. From a fanshaped\nnozzle came innumerable droplets of water, droplets of colloidal size\nthat hung in the air and only slowly coalesced into larger drops that\nfell toward the metal floor.\n  \n \n  Barry nodded, a smile beginning to spread across his drawn features.\n  \n \n  \"Perfect. Now put the window back.\"\n  \n \n  Outside lay the unknown world of Venus, and an open, unguarded window\nmight invite disaster.\n  \n \n  A few hours later Dr. Jensen found his patient in a normal sleep. The\nroom was warm and the air was so filled with water-mist it was almost\nliquid. Coalescing drops dripped from the walls and curving ceiling\nand furniture, from the half clad body of the sleeping man, and the\nscavenger pump made greedy gulping sounds as it removed excess water\nfrom the floor.\n  \n \n  The doctor shook his head as he backed out, his clothes clinging wet\nfrom the short exposure.\n  \n \n  It was abnormal.\n  \n \n  But so was Barry Barr.\n  \n \n  With breathing no longer a continuous agony Barry began to recover some\nof his strength. But for several days much of his time was spent in\nsleep and Dorothy Voorhees haunted his dreams.\n  \n \n  Whenever he closed his eyes he could see her as clearly as though\nshe were with him\u2014her face with the exotic high cheek-bones\u2014her\neyes a deep gray in fascinating contrast to her raven hair\u2014lips that\nseemed to promise more of giving than she had ever allowed herself to\nfulfil\u2014her incongruously pert, humorous little nose that was a legacy\nfrom some venturesome Irishman\u2014her slender yet firmly lithe body.\n  \n \n  After a few days Dr. Jensen permitted him to have visitors. They came\nin a steady stream, the people from Four and men he had not seen since\nTraining Base days, and although none could endure his semi-liquid\natmosphere more than a few minutes at a time Barry enjoyed their visits.\n  \n \n  But the person for whom he waited most anxiously did not arrive. At\neach knock Barry's heart would leap, and each time he settled back with\na sigh of disappointment. Days passed and still Dorothy did not come\nto him. He could not go to her, and stubborn pride kept him from even\ninquiring. All the while he was aware of Robson Hind's presence in the\nColony, and only weakness kept him from pacing his room like a caged\nanimal.\n  \n \n  Through his window he could see nothing but the gradual brightening\nand darkening of the enveloping fog as the slow 82-hour Venusian day\nprogressed, but from his visitors' words he learned something of\nVenusian conditions and the story of the Colony.\n  \n \n  Number One had bumbled in on visual, the pilot depending on the smeary\nimages of infra-sight goggles. An inviting grassy plain had proved to\nbe a layer of algae floating on quicksand. Frantically the crew had\nblasted down huge balsa-like marsh trees, cutting up the trunks with\nflame guns to make crude rafts. They had performed fantastic feats of\nstrength and endurance but managed to salvage only half their equipment\nbefore the shining nose of One had vanished in the gurgling ooze.\n  \n \n  Lost in a steaming, stinking marsh teeming with alien creatures that\nslithered and crawled and swam and flew, blinded by the eternal fog,\nthe crew had proved the rightness of their choice as pioneers. For\nweeks they had floundered across the deadly terrain until at last,\nbeside a stagnant-looking slough that drained sluggishly into a warm,\nalmost tideless sea a mile away, they had discovered an outcropping of\nrock. It was the only solid ground they had encountered.\n  \n \n  One man had died, his swamp suit pierced by a poisonous thorn, but the\nothers had hand-hauled the radio beacon piece by piece and set it up\nin time to guide Two to a safe landing. Houses had been assembled, the\nsecondary power units of the spaceship put to work, and the colony had\nestablished a tenuous foothold.\n  \n \n  Three had landed beside Two a few months later, bringing\nreinforcements, but the day-by-day demands of the little colony's\nstruggle for survival had so far been too pressing to permit extended\nor detailed explorations. Venus remained a planet of unsolved mysteries.\n  \n \n  The helicopter brought out in Three had made several flights which\nby radar and sound reflection had placed vague outlines on the blank\nmaps. The surface appeared to be half water, with land masses mainly\njungle-covered swamp broken by a few rocky ledges, but landings away\nfrom base had been judged too hazardous.\n  \n \n  Test borings from the ledge had located traces of oil and radioactive\nminerals, while enough Venusian plants had proven edible to provide an\nadequate though monotonous food source.\n  \n \n  Venus was the diametric opposite of lifeless Mars. Through the fog\ngigantic insects hummed and buzzed like lost airplanes, but fortunately\nthey were harmless and timid.\n  \n \n  In the swamps wildly improbable life forms grew and reproduced and\nfought and died, and many of those most harmless in appearance\npossessed surprisingly venomous characteristics.\n  \n \n  The jungle had been flamed away in a huge circle around the colony to\nminimize the chances of surprise by anything that might attack, but the\nblasting was an almost continuous process. The plants of Venus grew\nwith a vigor approaching fury.\n  \n \n  Most spectacular of the Venusian creatures were the amphibious armored\nmonsters, saurian or semi-saurians with a slight resemblance to the\nbrontosauri that had once lived on Earth, massive swamp-dwellers that\nused the slough beside the colony's ledge as a highway. They were\napparently vegetarians, but thorough stupidity in tremendous bulk made\nthem dangerous. One had damaged a building by blundering against it,\nand since then the colony had remained alert, using weapons to repel\nthe beasts.\n  \n \n  The most important question\u2014that of the presence or absence of\nintelligent, civilized Venusians\u2014remained unanswered. Some of the men\nreported a disquieting feeling of being watched, particularly when near\nopen water, but others argued that any intelligent creatures would have\nestablished contact."}
{"id":"THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_5","contents":"Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had\ndone to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n  \n \n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n  \n \n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n  \n \n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all\nthat seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in\nher eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n  \n \n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned.\n\"I\u2014think\u2014I\u2014know\u2014who\u2014wrote\u2014that\u2014letter!\" he declared grimly.\n  \n \n  \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt\nin her voice.\n  \n \n  Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe you, Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days\nat Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n  \n \n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n  \n \n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or\njudiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook\nsome undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the\nFive Ship Plan.\n  \n \n  But even with his trickery Hind had lost.\n  \n \n  He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom.\n  \n \n  The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead\ntubelight was off.\n  \n \n  He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest.\n  \n \n  Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead,\ncut off outside his room.\n  \n \n  Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air\nwould be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call\nfor help.\n  \n \n  The door was locked!\n  \n \n  He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had\nbeen removed.\n  \n \n  He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal\ndoorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was\nefficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to\nbounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped.\n  \n \n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n  \n \n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n  \n \n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n  \n \n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n  \n \n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n  \n \n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n  \n \n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n  \n \n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n  \n \n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n  \n \n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n  \n \n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n  \n \n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n  \n \n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n  \n \n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n  \n \n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n  \n \n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n  \n \n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n  \n \n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n  \n \n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n  \n \n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n  \n \n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n  \n \n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n  \n \n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n  \n \n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n  \n \n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n  \n \n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n  \n \n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n  \n \n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n  \n \n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n  \n \n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n  \n \n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n  \n \n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n  \n \n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n  \n \n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone."}

SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DILLON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   No one, least of all Martin, could dispute\n    \n   that a man's life should be guarded by his\n    \n   kin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet?\n   \n \n \n \n  Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother\ndisappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way\nof disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better\noff without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this\ngood while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin\nhad never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of\nsoldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country in\nsuccessive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble\nthat way.\n  \n \n  Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story\nabout her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really\nwas his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell\nhim to call her \"\n   \n   Aunt Ninian\n   \n  \"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd\nbeen around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought\nmaybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little\ntoo crazy for that.\n  \n \n  He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer\nwith Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry\ninstead of mopping up the floor with him.\n  \n \n  \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why\ndo you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin\nConrad?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n  \n \n  Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and\nkilling you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.\nYou wouldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're damn right. I\n   \n   don't\n   \n  understand. What's it all about in\nstraight gas?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you\nget older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\""}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_2","contents":"So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the\nway they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he\nknew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to\nthink it was disgusting.\n  \n \n  \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n  \n \n  She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n  \n \n  And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up\nthe place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in\nthe streets\u2014especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding\nto know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew\nhow to give them the cold shoulder.\n  \n \n  One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming\nto school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very\nregularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and\nshe went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and\nwould make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so\nhard inside.\n  \n \n  But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and\nhired a private tutor for him. A tutor\u2014in that neighborhood! Martin\nhad to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step\nwithout hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n  \n \n  Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people\nthought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little\nbetter than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There\nwere an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the\nsame way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty\ndumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n  \n \n  \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical\napplication to go by,\" she told him.\n  \n \n  He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out\nwrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what\nshe'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a\nspectator.\n  \n \n  When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,\nNinian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that\nmushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where\nintensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n  \n \n  \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she\ndeclared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n  \n \n  And keep an eye on him she did\u2014she or a rather foppish young man who\ncame to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle\nRaymond.\n  \n \n  From time to time, there were other visitors\u2014Uncles Ives and\nBartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many\nmore\u2014all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_3","contents":"Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play\nwith the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents\nwould have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if\na one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be\nsomething pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as\nconspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she\nwas supposed to know better than he did.\n  \n \n  He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,\nwarm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by\nmore luxury than he knew what to do with.\n  \n \n  The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There\nwere tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every\ninch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls\nwere mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time\nand a freezer well stocked with food\u2014somewhat erratically chosen, for\nNinian didn't know much about meals.\n  \n \n  The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a\nneat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n  \n \n  Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other\nkids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given\nhim enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd\nnearly killed him\u2014but then there had also been times when she'd hugged\nand kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all\nshe could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how\u2014and if\nrespectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n  \n \n  From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.\nThey made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry\nout a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,\nin their minds and in their talk they were living in another world\u2014a\nworld of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the\ngovernment service or the essential professions. And they seemed to\nthink even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than\nactually doing anything with the hands.\n  \n \n  In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;\neverything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear\npretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was\nno devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of\nnormal living.\n  \n \n  It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of\nthem were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.\nThey came from the future."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_4","contents":"When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\npromised five years before.\n  \n \n  \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an\nidealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n  \n \n  Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\nrather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\nstore or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\nand he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear\nglasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\nand his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\ncarefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n  \n \n  \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\nthe not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\ncontinued. \"Which\n   \n   is\n   \n  distressing\u2014though, of course, it's not as\nif they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\npassing laws to do away with the\u2014well, abuses and things like that,\nand I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\nConrad is so impatient.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you\u2014our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\nsnapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.\nBut remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same\npeople ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\nyears of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\nunderstand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.\nAll that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\nworlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\nexpensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how\nwould they manage to live?\"\n  \n \n  \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how\ndo\n   \n   you\n   \n  live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for\nyou,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the\npast and think in the future.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but\nif you will persist in these childish interruptions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of\nhis descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\nyoung people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\nconsiderable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And\nhe had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\nlot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or\u2014more\nfrightening\u2014his race had lost something vital.\n  \n \n  Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\nRaymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\nfeel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for\nthe fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\nmight never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous\u2014his feeling\nguilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\ngreat-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\naccountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_5","contents":"Raymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this\nor don't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for\nhimself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n  \n \n  \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time\ntransmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally\nofficious\u2014always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to\nbe hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always\ndesperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n  \n \n  Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'\nassistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back\nin time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,\nthere would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never\nget to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n  \n \n  \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n  \n \n  Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the\n   \n   adolescent\n   \n  way,\" he said, \"to do\naway with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole\nsociety in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps\nhe built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such\nmatters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea\nof eliminating our great-grandfather\u2014because our great-grandfather\nwas such a\n   \n   good\n   \n  man, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip\ncurled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of\nhis great-grandfather's father\u2014who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty\nworthless character.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n  \n \n  Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you\nmustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in\na rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us\u2014the other\ncousins and me\u2014held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it\nwas our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He\nbeamed at Martin.\n  \n \n  The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in\n   \n   eliminating\n   \n  me, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n  \n \n  Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really\nsuppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer\naltruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the\ncousins possessed to a consternating degree."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_6","contents":"Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long\nago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n  \n \n  \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's\nassistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\n\"and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\n  \n \n \n   Induced\n   \n  , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the\nuse of the iron maiden.\n  \n \n  \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad.

So we made\nour counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and here\nwe are!\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed\nout defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good\nthing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary\nconveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more you\ncould ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of\ncourse Ninian\n   \n   was\n   \n  a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any\nlittle thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our\nera has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,\nwe'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.\nOstentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,\nthe more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might\nas well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this\nwretched historical stint.\"\n  \n \n  \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel\ncuriously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a\nremote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, for\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in\nexile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer\nthan yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat\ngovernment.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to\ngo all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we\naren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the\nsad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n  \n \n  Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy\nsentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,\nyou know.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring\nof alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to\nprotect me when he comes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said\nwith modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's\ncombination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no\ndoubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. \"And we've got a\nrather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n  \n \n  Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring\nwhich, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was\ndubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this\n   \n   house\n   \n  ,\nbut do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this\n   \n   time\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory\nguarantee and all that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have\none of those guns, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that\nmyself!\""}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_7","contents":"When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at\nher own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\nat understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\nhim. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\ncheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\nthat she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\nvery last.\n  \n \n  Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\nsite proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\ndozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether\nthis had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\ndescendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n  \n \n  Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\nMartin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\nconvenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\ncarefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\nfrom the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\nMartin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\ndulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally\ndreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\ntypical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\naquarium.\n  \n \n  \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\ngo with a castle.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\nseem safer somehow.\"\n  \n \n  The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\nnervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that\nstood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\nseveral times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\nthe ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\nuntil Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n  \n \n  During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the\nhigher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\narose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At\nleast twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\ntheir vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\nsuch occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\nentertainment."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_8","contents":"\"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond\ncommented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,\nunless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one\njust\u2014well, drifts along happily.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we\ncould take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you\nmade up your mind what you want to be?\"\n  \n \n  Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\n\"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n  \n \n  There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n  \n \n  \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't\nknow how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.\nSubconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might\ninvent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from\nparticularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n  \n \n  \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,\nto be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over\nagain, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.\nBesides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of\ntheir times.\"\n  \n \n  \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much\ndifference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n  \n \n  Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that\nother time?\"\n  \n \n  There was a chilly silence.\n  \n \n  \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be\nthankful we've saved you from\n   \n   that\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent\nsecond-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first\nrank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost\npurely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was\nfear\u2014the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and\nwalk into a man who looked like him\u2014a man who wanted to kill him for\nthe sake of an ideal.\n  \n \n  But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty\npictures."}

Ives took his\nresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\nto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\ncritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\nsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\ninterested.\n  \n \n  \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\nyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n  \n \n  Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\nas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\nman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\nchange of air and scenery.\n  \n \n  \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\nspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\nTourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\nwhich Martin christened\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . They traveled about from sea\nto ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\ntrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the\nnearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\nsame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\nmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n  \n \n  The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\nlargely because they could spend so much time far away from the\ncontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\nthey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\nthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\ntime.\n  \n \n  More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\nthey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an\n   \n   avant-garde\n   \n  form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n  \n \n  Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable."}
{"id":"THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_10","contents":"He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\ntogether; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\nfrom. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\naccurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\nproper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\nleft on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\ninterbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue\nof their distinguished ancestry.\n  \n \n  \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\nplanned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\nEverything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\ndeported.\n  \n \n  \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\nof them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\nof some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\nfor officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\nregretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\nhimself. \"Maybe it\n   \n   is\n   \n  worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\nfor us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.\nBombed.

Martin\nhad gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\nwished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\nBut he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n  \n \n  He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\nthe basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\nbeen Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\nbitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\nthe future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\ntake a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was\nburied in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\ncontinent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n  \n \n  A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony.

Raymond\nread the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical\ncousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\nabout the entire undertaking.\n  \n \n  \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\nIves, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n  \n \n  But Martin disagreed."}

That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney.

He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n  \n \n  The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting\nuntil we're off guard.

Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera.

Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n  \n \n  When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n  \n \n  \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all.

The last I saw of them they were being\npursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible!\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\"\n  \n \n  A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging\non carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and\nstarted yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side\nof his office.

Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n  \n \n  Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\nhad to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n  \n \n  Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\nHis camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\nfrom filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\nthrowing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\nfragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n  \n \n  Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\nof the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\ntwitch. God, what photography!\n  \n \n  Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\nfired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\nThen Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\ntaking place immediately outside his window.\n  \n \n  The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\nout of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\""}

Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago.

As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular.

Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office."}

They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens.

You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends."}
{"id":"THE_PLAGUE_3","contents":"It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared."}
{"id":"THE_PLAGUE_4","contents":"And from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report\u2014nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen\u2014not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic.

And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom?

Half\nthe adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same\nthing\u2014only not quite as severe\u2014in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mostly.

He doesn't even know what it's all about.\nNobody's sick in his valley.\"\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his\ncigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all\nlumped together.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does it show?\"\n  \n \n  \"Black-out.

That place where they voted on water bonds or something,\neverybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't\neven heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head.\n  \n \n  Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the\nouter office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a\npaper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and\nnibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk.\n  \n \n  Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of\nhis cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily.\n\"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.

Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy."}

He checked them on a receipt ledger,\nwhile Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the\ncylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped\nthe knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its\ngleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted\nincandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and\nscary.\n  \n \n  He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left\narmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the\nway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket\nback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the\nelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Jack moved massively.

Right, punk?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.\nHis legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear\nthe way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll\nshow you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until\nhe screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,\nran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But\nthat wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,\nwhat was he doing holding down a desk?\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly\ncollection.\"\n  \n \n  The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch\nfrom Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped\na knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n  \n \n  Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his\npasscard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours.

Lights turned pale,\nsecretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted\npotholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.\nWayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath\nthrough the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with\nthe shadows of mysterious promise.\n  \n \n  He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel.

A stewbum weaved out of\na bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked\nshirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub\nbalanced on one end.\n  \n \n  The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had\na dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a\ngrotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and\ndoom.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta hide, kid.

The Cad rushed\npast Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires\nsquealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and\ncrouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n  \n \n  \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand\ncame up swinging a baseball bat.\n  \n \n  A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n  \n \n  The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The\nteener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air\nas the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n  \n \n  Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder\nat finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew\nand no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.\nLiving seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,\nuntil something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He\nheld his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in\nspirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting\nlicense and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n  \n \n  The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener\nlaughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell\nclogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth\nstill open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled\nup with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n  \n \n  The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down\nwith his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the\nCad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling\nglass.\n  \n \n  \"Go, man!\"\n  \n \n  The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it\nbounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like\nbright wind-blown sparks.\n  \n \n  Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in\nscummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made\nhis heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n  \n \n  He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and\npursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires."}

He could not quite explain the\nfeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since\nthe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,\nfrom the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his\nlife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had\ngrown.\n  \n \n  If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This\ndisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had\nrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside\nhim.\n  \n \n  Today, space looked somehow different. The stars\u2014it was a meaningless\nconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright\npinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport\u2014were not\napparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,\nthere was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart\nby itself in the middle of the viewport.\n  \n \n  If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was\nodd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was\u2014it was\u2014what\nwas it?\n  \n \n  Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and\ngreeted gray-haired old Chuls.\n  \n \n  \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire\nchildren. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the\nhealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;\nhe just didn't, without comprehending.\n  \n \n  Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the\ntime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select\nas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud\nignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling\nhe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man\nhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always\nembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a\nheadache?\n  \n \n  Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here\nand knew it was your time, too....\"\n  \n \n  His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not\nexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had\ndeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_2","contents":"A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the\nhealth-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray\ntubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant\ntube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch\nthe one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing\nlarger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a\nmetallic voice said. \"Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy\nhim. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when\nhe wanted to do it?\n   \n   There\n   \n  was a strange thought, and Rikud's brain\nwhirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and\nunsatisfactory answers.\n  \n \n  He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got\nhurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl\nhimself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen.\nBut something soft had cushioned the impact\u2014something which had come\ninto being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being\nagain, something which was as impalpable as air.\n  \n \n  Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real\nauthority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that\nthere should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine\nin the library had told him of the elders\u2014a meaningless term\u2014who had\ngoverned the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but\nthat was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only\nlistened to the buzzer.\n  \n \n  And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said.\nThere had been a revolt\u2014again a term without any real meaning, a term\nthat could have no reality outside of the reading machine\u2014and the\nelders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people\nhad decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and\nthat it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They were\nborn and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little\ncogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but\nhe knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the\npeople against the elders, and it said the people had won.\n  \n \n  Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he\nhad to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the\nlook of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down upon\nhim, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations\nbefore Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of\nmedicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old\nage, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud\noften thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future,\nnot without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only\na decade to go.\n  \n \n  Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy\nthrough the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time\nRikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True,\nthis was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it\nproved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw\nCrifer limp.\n  \n \n  But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_3","contents":"Now Crifer said, \"I've been reading again, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the\nsmell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it\nmeant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the\nlibrary and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat\nabout and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.\n  \n \n  But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the\npeople ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it\nwas always the same.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They're also\ncalled astronomy, I think.\"\n  \n \n  This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one\nelbow. \"What did you find out?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, where's the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow.\n  \n \n  \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under\n'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous\nterms.\"\n  \n \n  \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are\nchanging.\"\n  \n \n  \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he\nquestioned what it might mean in this particular case.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the\nothers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud\nknew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he\ndid.\n  \n \n  Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told\nthem, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly.\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without\nmeaning.\"\n  \n \n  \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested.\n  \n \n  A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and\nChuls said, \"It's almost time for me to eat.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two\nconcepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,\nbut now it faded, and change and old were just two words.\n  \n \n  His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange\nfeeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the\nviewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the\nworld, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.\nHe had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly\nremembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;\nthis was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings\u2014strange\nchannelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.\n  \n \n  He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the\nstars again."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_4","contents":"The view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud's pulses\nleap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and\nwhere Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of\nlight, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his\neyes to look.\n  \n \n  Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to\nturn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed\nto control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white\nglobe\u2014if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There\nwas that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age?\nRikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's\nbook on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was\nvariable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.\n  \n \n  Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer,\nand he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that\nhe couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his\neyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them.\nBut the new view persisted.\n  \n \n  Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone,\ntoo, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge\nthat it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and\nround, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud\nhad no name.\n  \n \n  A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section\nof it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the\nviewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the\nmiddle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green,\nand on the other, blue.\n  \n \n  Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world\nhad ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular\nintervals by a sharp booming.\n  \n \n  Change\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.\n  \n \n  \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.\n  \n \n  But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him,\nand for a while he struggled with it. What he saw\u2014what he had always\nseen, except that now there was the added factor of change\u2014perhaps did\nnot exist\n   \n   in\n   \n  the viewport.\n  \n \n  Maybe it existed\n   \n   through\n   \n  the viewport.\n  \n \n  That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see\nnothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more\nconfusing than ever.\n  \n \n  \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.\n  \n \n  Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of\nvapor. \"What do you see?\"\n  \n \n  Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Else? Nothing.\"\n  \n \n  Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do\nyou hear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of\nthe engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining\nroom, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_5","contents":"Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a\nmoment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world.\nBut that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And\nbesides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far\nvaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport\nwhich was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover,\ndid not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens\ndid. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.\n  \n \n  Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.\n  \n \n  The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_6","contents":"For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept\nit as fact. There\u2014through the viewport and in it\u2014was a garden. A\ngarden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had\nnever seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the\nworld's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,\nit was a garden.\n  \n \n  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\nhe admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n  \n \n  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could\nnot tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the\nviewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking\u2014the\nword seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless\nit were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere\nwas the garden and the world had arrived.\n  \n \n  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants\nare different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then they've changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, merely different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about the viewport?\n   \n   It\n   \n  changed. Where are the stars?\nWhere are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"\n  \n \n  \"The stars come out at night.\"\n  \n \n  \"So there is a change from day to night!\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they\nshine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once they shone all the time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\""}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_7","contents":"Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on\nastronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the\nreading machine had begun to bore him.

If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so\nobvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another,\nit was with a purpose\u2014to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the\nhealth-rays. Now if the world had walked from\u2014somewhere, through the\nvast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also\nwas purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But\nif everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could\nthey find the nature of that purpose?\n  \n \n  \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.\n  \n \n  Damn the man, all he did was eat!\n  \n \n  Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because\nhe was hungry.\n  \n \n  And Rikud, too, was hungry.\n  \n \n  Differently."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_8","contents":"He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\nnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\nmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n  \n \n  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\n   \n   through\n   \n  the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened\nit.

Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\nThere's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\nbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\nand Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\nend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\nRikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n  \n \n  He missed the beginning, but then:\n  \n \n \n   \u2014therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\ndoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\nrigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may\nhave discarded it for something better\u2014who knows? But if you have\nnot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\nis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\nhuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\npermit it\u2014within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\nto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\npermitted through this door\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\nwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\nthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\nvoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n  \n \n  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\nhumming, punctuated by a\n   \n   throb-throb-throb\n   \n  which sounded not unlike\nthe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't\nblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's\neyes\u2014he blinked and looked again, but it was still there\u2014cogs and\ngears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\nthey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n  \n \n  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but\nno one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n  \n \n  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\nexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\nopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n  \n \n  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\nviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\nalthough it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\nwas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\nthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\noff in the distance.\n  \n \n  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\nhand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\nviewport. He began to turn the handle.\n  \n \n  Then he trembled.\n  \n \n  What would he do out in the garden?\n  \n \n  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly\nthought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\ncouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt\ndry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n  \n \n  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\nthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\nthrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n  \n \n  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\nnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and\nsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\ngarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\nwalk and then might find himself in the garden.\n  \n \n  It was so big."}

He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that\nheld it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he\nswung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding,\ncrashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled\nunder his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.\n  \n \n \n \n  Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not\ncasual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud\nsmashed everything in sight.\n  \n \n  When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room\nwas a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first,\nbut presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in\nhis ears because now the throbbing had stopped.\n  \n \n  He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller\nviewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain\nbeneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone\nclearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.\n  \n \n  Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that\ndoor. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once,\nwhen he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the\ndarkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.\n  \n \n  Whimpering, he fled."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_12","contents":"All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did\nnot sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to\neat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the\nwhimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the\nsmooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run\nany more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.\n  \n \n  Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied\nconfidently.\n  \n \n  \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said.\n  \n \n  \"What won't?\"\n  \n \n  \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad\nthing you did, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the\nstars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there\nbeyond the viewport.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said.\n  \n \n  Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can\neat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"\n  \n \n  There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I\nhate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.\n  \n \n  Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with\nhim and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have\nhad a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's\nquarters. Did women eat?\n  \n \n  Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a\nfrond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the\nplants in the viewport would even be better.\n  \n \n  \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.\n  \n \n  Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you,\ntoo, to show you how it is to be broken.\"\n  \n \n  \"We must go outside\u2014through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd\ngurgling sound his stomach made.\n  \n \n  A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard\nCrifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.\n  \n \n  Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had\nbroken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer\nto understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.\n  \n \n  The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.\n\"I hit him! I hit him!\"\n  \n \n  Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone\nwas on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and\nhe did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us\ndo to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the\ndarkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too\nweak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing\nhurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices\nand the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.\n  \n \n  It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run\nwas chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and\nhow big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him\nwere unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely\nand positively.\n  \n \n  He became sickly giddy thinking about it.\n  \n \n  But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would\ndie because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and\ngrumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.\n  \n \n  He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library,\nthrough the inner door and into the room with the voice\u2014but the\nvoice didn't speak this time\u2014through its door and into the place of\nmachinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and\nhe thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard\nCrifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.\n  \n \n  Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor.\nHe felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it\nwith his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.\n  \n \n  He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were\ncloser now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness,\nit frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those\nbehind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not\nfar away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to\nbreak him.\n  \n \n  Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life.\nThe garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of\nlow mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If\nplants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could\npeople. Rikud and his people\n   \n   should\n   \n  . This was why the world had moved\nacross the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more.\nBut he was afraid.\n  \n \n  He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his\nfingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head.\nSlowly he slipped to the cool floor\u2014how his head was burning!\u2014and for\na long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he\nheard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on\nthe metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest:\n\"There is Rikud on the floor!\"\n  \n \n  Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright.\nSomething small and brown scurried across the other side of the\nviewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous\nred eyes.\n  \n \n  Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face\nwas so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that\neveryone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the\nmachinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal\nwhich he could see in the dim light through the open door.\n  \n \n  \"Where's the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You\nbroke it. And now we will break you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped\ndown against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps\ncame, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway.\nThen there were others, and then they were walking toward him.\n  \n \n  His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it\nbe variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying\nbrown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his\nstomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing\ncould live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness,\nthen so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....\n  \n \n  So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And\nhis heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of\nhis neck.\n  \n \n  He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the\nblue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row\nof mounds."}
{"id":"The_Sense_of_Wonder_13","contents":"Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and\nsomeone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall.

He\nwalked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel\nthe floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the\nhorizon. It was all very beautiful.\n  \n \n  Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across\nthe land, and Rikud lay down and drank.

{"id":"THE_SERPENT_RIVER_3","contents":"class=\"chap\"\/>\n  \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the\nsummit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a\ncloser view of the strange thing we had come to see.\n  \n \n  It shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late\nafternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like\n   \n   something\n   \n  that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n  \n \n  There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain\u2014or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n  \n \n  We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n  \n \n \n   What was it?\n   \n \n \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n  \n \n  We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable\u2014a vine of glacier proportions\u2014or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance\u2014we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n  \n \n  Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n  \n \n  I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n  \n \n  \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two,\nOrder of Duties upon Landing: A\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See\nit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from\nunder its belly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\"\n  \n \n  \"No sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about it? Any comments?\"\n  \n \n  Split answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with\nrestraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir.\nAny orders, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks\u2014thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n  \n \n  He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n  \n \n  Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"\u2014and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n  \n \n  Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n  \n \n  \"What do you see?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the\nobject I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're seeing some sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"A living creature, sir\u2014upright, wearing clothes\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   man\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"To all appearances, sir\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You bounder, give me that telescope!\""}

A man!\nAcross millions of miles of space\u2014a man, like the men of the Earth.\n  \n \n  Six times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realms\nwithin the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had the\nliving creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life of\nour Earth.\n  \n \n  A man!\n  \n \n  He might have been creeping on all fours.\n  \n \n  He might have been skulking like a lesser animal.\n  \n \n  He might have been entirely naked.\n  \n \n  He was none of these\u2014and at the very first moment of viewing him I\nfelt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance\u2014but had\nmy ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own race\na million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life had\nsomehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know? By\nwhat faded charts of the movements through the sky will man ever be\nable to retrace relationships of forms of life among planets?\n  \n \n  \"Get ready to go out and meet him, Campbell,\" I said. \"He's a friend.\"\n  \n \n  Split Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even know\nwhat sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly or\nmurderous.\n  \n \n  \"There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take my\nword for it, he's a friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't say anything, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Don't. Just get ready.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're going to go\n   \n   out\n   \n  \u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" I said. \"Orders.\"\n  \n \n  \"And meet both of them?\" Split was at the telescope.\n  \n \n  \"Both?\" I took the instrument from him. Both! \"Well!\"\n  \n \n  \"They seem to be coming out of the ground,\" Split said. \"I see no signs\nof habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground\ncity\u2014though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.\"\n  \n \n  \"One's a male and the other's a female,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"Another hypothesis,\" said Split.\n  \n \n  The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two \"friends\".\nThey were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our\nship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently\ncome up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied\nthem through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a\nhike.\n  \n \n  The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might\nguess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold,\ncleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the\ncream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in\nthe breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this\nwas matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a\ncircular mantle.\n  \n \n  The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some\nsort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the\nsetting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break\nin the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions,\nhis moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.\n  \n \n  The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back\nof her.... Three.... Four.... Five....\n  \n \n  \"Where do they come from?\" Split had paused in the act of checking\nequipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I\nmight not have made a discovery. The landscape was\n   \n   moving\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a\nprominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I\nlooked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.\n  \n \n  They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the\ncrowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees\nthemselves were moving.\n  \n \n  \"Notice anything?\" I asked Split.\n  \n \n  \"The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.\" He\ngazed. \"They're coming from underground.\"\n  \n \n  Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of\nthe moving trees.\n  \n \n  \"Notice anything else unusual?\" I persisted.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The females\u2014I'm speaking hypothetically\u2014but they\n   \n   must\n   \n  be\nfemales\u2014are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows.\nI wonder why?\"\n  \n \n  \"You haven't noticed the trees?\"\n  \n \n  \"The females are quite attractive,\" said Split.\n  \n \n  I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.\nMobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on other\nplanets\u2014\"sponge-trees\"\u2014which possessed a sort of muscular quality. If\nthese were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of the\nslope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paid\nno attention to them.\n  \n \n  I studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb.\nThe others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. The\nlemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the males\nand the soft curves of the females.\n  \n \n  \"Those furry elbow ornaments on the females,\" I said to Split,\n\"they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, so\nthey pad their elbows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on their\nshoulders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you complaining?\"\n  \n \n  We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we\nwere to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted their\nmeeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowing\nthat people from another world watched. The tall leader must be making\na speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in\ncalm, graceful gestures.\n  \n \n  \"They'd better break it up!\" Split said suddenly. \"The jungles are\nmoving in on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're spellbound,\" I said. \"They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you\never see moving trees?\"\n  \n \n  Split said sharply, \"Those trees are marching! They're an army under\ncover. Look!\"\n  \n \n  I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for\na sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as\ninnocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edged\nwith alarm. \"Captain! Those worshippers\u2014how can we warn them? Oh-oh!\nToo late. Look!\"\n  \n \n  All at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the heads\nof the savage band concealed within. They were warriors\u2014fifty or more\nof them\u2014with painted naked bodies. They dashed forward in a wide\nsemicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter."}
{"id":"THE_SERPENT_RIVER_5","contents":"class=\"chap\"\/>\n  \n  3.\n  \n \n  They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends.\nThey charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird\nclubs with a threat of death.\n  \n \n  Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence."}
{"id":"THE_SERPENT_RIVER_6","contents":"class=\"chap\"\/>\n  \n  4.\n  \n \n  Vauna, the beautiful daughter of Tomboldo, came into my life during the\nweeks that I lay unconscious.\n  \n \n  I must have talked aloud much during those feverish hours of darkness.\n  \n \n  \"Campbell!\" I would call out of a nightmare. \"Campbell, we're about to\nland. Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  \"S-s-sh!\" The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow\npenetrate my dream.\n  \n \n  The voices about me were soft. My dreams echoed the soft female voices\nof this new, strange language.\n  \n \n  \"Campbell, are you there?... Have you forgotten the Code, Campbell?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that's swabbing my face? I can't see.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's Vauna. She's smiling at you, Captain. Can't you see her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is this the pretty one we saw through the telescope?\"\n  \n \n  \"One of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what of the other? There were two together. I remember\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Omosla is here too. She's Vauna's attendant. We're all looking after\nyou, Captain Linden. Did you know I performed an operation to relieve\nthe pressure on your brain? You must get well, Captain.\" The words of\nCampbell came through insistently.\n  \n \n  After a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said,\n\"Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four?\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four,\" he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put\nme to sleep. \"Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No\nagent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed\nas binding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I interrupted. \"Clause D?\"\n  \n \n  He picked it up. \"D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with\nany native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain\nLinden? Or are you warning\n   \n   yourself\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred\nvision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her\u2014yes, she must have\nhaunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her\nfeatures more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the\nparty of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the\nattack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and\nfigure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's\nquestion. \"Myself.\"\n  \n \n  In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna.\nThe caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella\npeople lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of\ntheir life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning\nabout the world into which he has been born.\n  \n \n  Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together.\nOften when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire\nabout me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to\nconverse in simple words. And Vauna and I\u2014yes. If I could only avoid\nblacking out.\n  \n \n  I wanted to see her.\n  \n \n  So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space\nships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars.\nThe eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of\nVauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand.\n  \n \n  I regained my health gradually.\n  \n \n  \"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella\nwords. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you\nmore recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My\nfather is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are\nstill weak.\"\n  \n \n  It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust\nmyself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By\nnight they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep.\nStrange harmonies whispered through the caves.\n  \n \n  And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me\nthrough the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me,\nfaintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some\ncorridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to\ngo back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless\ndreams.\n  \n \n  The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing\nbefore me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a\nhint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook\nthe fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his\nflowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and\nplayed, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have learned to talk,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"You have had a long sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise,\nthe wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will\nwalk soon.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars\nand told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the\nship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make\nmyself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of\nforehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying\nto visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell\neach other.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the\n   \n   serpent\nriver\n   \n  .\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not\nknowing the Benzendella equivalent.\n   \n   I\n   \n  made an eel-like motion\nwith my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain,\nthe footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked\naround to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent\nfigure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and\ngreen diamond markings\u2014Gravgak.\n  \n \n  \"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.\n  \n \n  \"I get well,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant\nto be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes\ntold me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes\nflashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and\nstarted off. \"Get well!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway\nhe turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\"\n  \n \n  She started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I\nwill talk with you later, Gravgak.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\"\n  \n \n  He stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her\nfather, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.\n  \n \n  From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic\nmoment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master\u2014or her\nlover. He had called for her. She had followed.\n  \n \n  But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.\n\"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\"\n  \n \n  (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called\nthem! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a\njealous lover\u2014or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard\nwas a potential traitor?)\n  \n \n  Vauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been\ncalled back.\n  \n \n  Gravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway\nhe stood scowling.\n  \n \n  \"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at\nthe assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we\nwill move back to the other part of the world.\"\n  \n \n  There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.\n  \n \n  \"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend\u2014\"\nhe pointed to me\u2014\"is well enough to travel. We would never leave him\nhere to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through\nthe sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget\nthis kindness. When we ascend the\n   \n   Kao-Wagwattl\n   \n  , the ever moving\n   \n   rope of life\n   \n  , these friends shall come with us. On the back of\nthe Kao-Wagwattl\n   \n   they shall ride with us across the land\n   \n  .\""}

SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEISS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n   \n  on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I glanced at the path we had made across the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  . The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\""}
{"id":"The_Snare_2","contents":"Strange? The object rose a quarter of a mile above us, a huge, curving\nhulk of smooth metal. It was featureless and yet conveyed a sense\nof\n   \n   alienness\n   \n  . It was alien and yet it wasn't a natural formation.\nSomething had made the thing, whatever it was. But was it strange that\nit hadn't been noticed before? Men had lived on the Moon for over a\nyear, but the Moon was vast and the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  covered three\nhundred and forty thousand square miles.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" Marie asked breathlessly.\n  \n \n  Her husband grunted his bafflement. \"Who knows? But see how it curves?\nIf it's a perfect sphere, it must be at least two miles in diameter!\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's a perfect sphere,\" Miller suggested, \"most of it must be\nbeneath the Moon's surface.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe it isn't a sphere,\" my wife said. \"Maybe this is all of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's call Lunar City and tell the authorities about it.\" I reached\nfor the radio controls on my suit.\n  \n \n  Kane grabbed my arm. \"No. Let's find out whatever we can by ourselves.\nIf we tell the authorities, they'll order us to leave it alone. If we\ndiscover something really important, we'll be famous!\"\n  \n \n  I lowered my arm. His outburst seemed faintly childish to me. And yet\nit carried a good measure of common sense. If we discovered proof of\nan alien race, we would indeed be famous. The more we discovered for\nourselves, the more famous we'd be. Fame was practically a synonym for\nprestige and wealth.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I conceded.\n  \n \n  Miller stepped forward, moving slowly in the bulk of his spacesuit.\nDeliberately, he removed a small torch from his side and pressed the\nbrilliant flame against the metal.\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, the elderly mineralogist gave his opinion: \"It's\nsteel ... made thousands of years ago.\"\n  \n \n  Someone gasped over the intercom, \"Thousands of years! But wouldn't it\nbe in worse shape than this if it was that old?\"\n  \n \n  Miller pointed at the small cut his torch had made in the metal. The\nnotch was only a quarter of an inch deep. \"I say\n   \n   steel\n   \n  because it's\n   \n   similar\n   \n  to steel. Actually, it's a much stronger alloy. Besides that,\non the Moon, there's been no water or atmosphere to rust it. Not even\na wind to disturb its surface. It's\n   \n   at least\n   \n  several thousand years\nold.\""}
{"id":"The_Snare_3","contents":"We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n  \n \n  \"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\n  \n \n  We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\n   \n   must\n   \n  be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n  \n \n  \"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n  \n \n  \"Do you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's.\"\n  \n \n  I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\n  \n \n  Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\n  \n \n  For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\n  \n \n  The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\n   \n   Something\n   \n  pushed me!\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision.

We turned off our lamps.\n  \n \n  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n  \n \n  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n  \n \n  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n  \n \n  \"Miller!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n  \n \n  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n  \n \n  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n  \n \n  \"Miller, get help!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n  \n \n  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n  \n \n  Static grated against my ear drums.\n  \n \n \n   Static!"}
{"id":"The_Snare_5","contents":"I listened to the harsh, erratic sound and my voice was weak by\ncomparison: \"Calling Lunar City.\"\n  \n \n  \"Static!\" Kane echoed my thoughts. His frown made deep clefts between\nhis eyebrows. \"There's no static between inter-lunar radio!\"\n  \n \n  Verana's voice was small and frightened. \"That sounds like the static\nwe hear over the bigger radios when we broadcast to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" Marie agreed.\n  \n \n  \"But we wouldn't have that kind of static over\n   \n   our\n   \n  radio, unless\u2014\"\nVerana's eyes widened until the pupils were surrounded by circles of\nwhite\u2014\"unless we were in outer space!\"\n  \n \n  We stared at the metal door that had imprisoned us, afraid even to\nspeak of our fantastic suspicion.\n  \n \n  I deactivated my radio.\n  \n \n  Marie screamed as an inner door opened to disclose a long, narrow\ncorridor beyond.\n  \n \n  Simultaneous with the opening of the second door, I felt air press\nagainst my spacesuit. Before, our suits had been puffed outward by the\npressure of air inside. Now our spacesuits were slack and dangling on\nour bodies.\n  \n \n  We looked at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the\nopen door.\n  \n \n  We went single file, first Kane, then his wife Marie. Verana followed\nnext and I was the last.\n  \n \n  We walked slowly, examining the strange construction. The walls were\nfeatureless but still seemed alien. At various places on the walls were\nthe outlines of doors without handles or locks.\n  \n \n  Kane pressed his shoulder against a door and shoved. The door was\nunyielding.\n  \n \n  I manipulated the air-vent controls of my spacesuit, allowed a small\namount of the corridor's air into my helmet and inhaled cautiously.\nIt smelled all right. I waited and nothing happened. Gradually, I\nincreased the intake, turned off the oxygenating machines and removed\nmy helmet.\n  \n \n  \"Shut off your oxy,\" I suggested. \"We might as well breathe the air in\nthis place and save our supply. We may need the oxygen in our suits\nlater.\"\n  \n \n  They saw that I had removed my helmet and was still alive and one by\none removed their own helmets."}
{"id":"The_Snare_6","contents":"At the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweat\non his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane was\na pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of\nmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excited\neasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.\n  \n \n  \"The end of the line,\" he grunted.\n  \n \n  As though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side opened\nsoundlessly.\n  \n \n  He went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.\n  \n \n  The door closed behind him.\n  \n \n  Marie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. \"Harry!\"\n  \n \n  Verana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of the\ncorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.\n  \n \n  Before I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, through\nthe doorway.\n  \n \n  Verana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our muscles\nfrozen by shock.\n  \n \n  The door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.\n  \n \n  Verana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at the\nother doors that lined the hall.\n  \n \n  I put my arms around her, held her close.\n  \n \n  \"Antigravity machines, force rays,\" I suggested worriedly.\n  \n \n  For several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled the\npreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.\nThe Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds of\nother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Means\nof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amuse\nthemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple as\nthat: a walk on the Moon.\n  \n \n  We had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rock\nformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alien\nship.\n  \n \n  My legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana's\nperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incredible\nsituation, there was no sensation of unreality."}

The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\n  \n \n  This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\n  \n \n  I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\n  \n \n  The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n  \n \n  \"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\n  \n \n  The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\n  \n \n  I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\n  \n \n  The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\n  \n \n  I tasted a small piece.\n  \n \n  \"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\n  \n \n  Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n  \n \n  \"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her."}

The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\n  \n \n  Another room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\n  \n \n  The last room was an observatory.

Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune.

There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke.

A faint, bitter smile curved\nhis generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of\nKoerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again\u2014you don't know\nBertram!

{"id":"THE_SOUL_EATERS_3","contents":"The stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil\ndesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot\nfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as\nif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a\ndecision, he were forcing himself to speak:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for\ntwo reasons. The first one you already know\u2014your capture of one of\nKoerber's henchmen\u2014has given us a line as to his present orbit of\npiracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not\nreally why I've brought you here.\" He frowned again as if what he had\nto say were difficult indeed.\n  \n \n  \"Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her\u2014a\ndelicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and\nvery clever young lady could perform. And,\" he paused, grimacing,\n\"somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing\nher and several other passengers, began to send distress signals.\nFinally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days\noverdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold\nmillions, the spacer itself\u2014seem to have vanished.\"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel\neyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits\nthat smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides,\nwhile something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel\nprecision.\n  \n \n  \"Marla!\" He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power\nof Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an\natom-blast.\n  \n \n  \"Commander,\" Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of\nemotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself\u2014and\nthat grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known\nevery change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.\n\"Commander, give me one ...\n   \n   one\n   \n  chance at that spawn of unthinkable\nbegetting! Let me try, and I promise you ...\" in his torture, Dennis\nwas unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surface\nof the priceless desk, \"I promise you that I will either bring you\nKoerber, or forfeit my life!\"\n  \n \n  Commander Bertram nodded his head. \"I brought you here for that\npurpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where\nthe last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!\"\n  \n \n  He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set\non his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. \"You'll now see\na visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left\nVenus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel\nin space. This, Dennis,\" the Commander emphasized his words, \"is your\nchance to redeem yourself!\" He fell silent, while the viso-screen began\nto show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer\nup-tilted in its cradle."}
{"id":"THE_SOUL_EATERS_4","contents":"They watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into\nspace and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of\nVenus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.\n  \n \n  A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on\nthe viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud\ninterplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void,\nand suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved\nas if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining\naltitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic\ncourse, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's\nside.\n  \n \n  Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in\nactuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it\nwas an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with\ndeadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of\nthe barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.\n  \n \n  Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose\nfeatures were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor\nand the burning fire in his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach\nTerra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other\ntransports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes\nthey're never seen again.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin\nof ice.\n  \n \n  \"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with\ndouble hull\u2014a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed\nof the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses\nanything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination\nroom, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He\nextended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have\u2014aside from your\nrecklessness\u2014and on your success depends far more than the capture of\nan outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a\nphantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally\nelusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of\nfathomless space.\n  \n \n  To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first\nassignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the\ninner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance\nagainst stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even\ntheir cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked\nthe luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol\nspacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was\nhoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a\nthing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the\ncomfortable luxury that they knew.\n  \n \n  Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits,\nmanning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and\neternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.\n  \n \n  And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search\nas a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the\nviso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to\nlife. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured\nthe space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the\nviso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and\nbecoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.\n  \n \n  Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke\ncommanded through the teleradio from the control room:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to board!\"\n  \n \n  Every member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for\nall but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his\napprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt\nnauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of\nspace. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale\nwhen the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who\nwere to go beside himself:\n  \n \n  \"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in\nhis basso-profundo voice.\n  \n \n  \"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice\nof the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test\noxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\"\n  \n \n  George Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the\nspace to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a\nproud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he\nturned away with a look of shame.\n  \n \n  Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed\nsurvey.\n  \n \n  \"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo\nmissing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were\nout of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been\nfired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly\nhe seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced.\nSomehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed,\nwhere life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great\nresolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.\n  \n \n  Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in\nthinking of her and all he had lost. When he finally spoke, his voice\nwas harsh, laconic:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to return!\"\n  \n \n  Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a\nmajor battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter,\nshifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and\ngazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various\nversions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit\nin their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.\n  \n \n  Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow,\neasygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the\nswiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of\nmen toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third\nlieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed\nby Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as\nif the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched\nthem intimately."}
{"id":"THE_SOUL_EATERS_5","contents":"Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George\nRandall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the\nairlocks and removed the space suits.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet\nAnalyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!\" He was\nfairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the\nnew invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great\ndistance were his own achievement.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he\nprayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger\nspacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp\n39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None\nbut a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the\ndangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric\nuncharted orbits.\n  \n \n  Dennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room,\nfollowed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in any form was\nanathema. There could be no doubt now! The \"Jet Analyzer\" recorded\npowerful disturbance, atomic\u2014could be nothing else.\n  \n \n  Instantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker:\n  \n \n  \"Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!\"\n  \n \n  Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved\nmotors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each\nmember of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action\nimpended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed\nrelief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men\nsuddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth.\nAll but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped\nhis throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P.\nuniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to\nkeep calm, his hands trembled beyond control.\n  \n \n  In the compact, super-armored control room, Captain Brooke watched\nthe telecast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that were golden with\nanticipation. It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at\nlast, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally\nreached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by\nleaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the\ndistance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit.\n  \n \n  But at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen,\nunmistakably for what it was\u2014a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden\nmaneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described\na parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if\nnavigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the\nasteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose\nthe I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have\nsucceeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such\na trap without specific orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the\nchase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he\ncould take Koerber with him.\n  \n \n  Weaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his\nquarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo\nfrom starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up\nspewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last.\n  \n \n  From the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain\nof atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward\nmidship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been\nmortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power\ndive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as\nhe came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was\nripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under\nthe detonating impact.\n  \n \n  It was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming\nimmediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom\ndesperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass,\nbut too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no\navail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was\ndoomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful\nmagnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser."}
{"id":"THE_SOUL_EATERS_6","contents":"With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis\nmaneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he\nsank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the\nmaneuver avoided it.\n  \n \n  \"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all\njets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed\nout of the increasing gravity trap.\n  \n \n  \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the\njets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then\nKoerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught,\nforced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of\na whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that\nshook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.\n  \n \n  Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to\nmeet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy.\nIt showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active.\nGravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this\nunknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time\nwas supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could\npossibly explain the incredible gravity.\n  \n \n  And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to\nRandall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes\nhimself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action,\ntoo late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent\na crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding\nthem in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided\na man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser,\nthe strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them,\nwas anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against\nthe sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in\nthe cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could\nreach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he\nturned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her\nup, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\"\n  \n \n  Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into\nthe forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower\npetals. The crash-landing had not helped either.\n  \n \n  \"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain,\nbut,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.\n  \n \n  \"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his\nordinarily gentle voice like a lash.\n  \n \n  \"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting\nshot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the\nemergency tank to make it down here!\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis\nBrooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom\ntugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed\nmournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long,\nragged line of cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing\na job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast\nand out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in\nthis hellish rock-pile?\"\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale,\nimpassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His\ncontemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who\nfailed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place\nin the I.S.P.\n  \n \n  \"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said\nthoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for\nour atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal\noptimist.\n  \n \n  \"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom,\nyou get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log\nbook, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try\nto find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a\nlow voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.\n  \n \n  A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear\nthe last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead\nbumped during the crash landing.\n  \n \n  \"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue.\n  \n \n  \"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you\nwanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding\njob....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the\nwords had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His\ncandid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage\nwith its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened\nthe anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized\nthis was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better\nmen than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had\nbeen an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in\nthe grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung\nhis neck!\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll\nneed all hands now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his\nmouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon\nhim, he whirled and re-entered the ship.\n  \n \n  \"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook\nhis head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin\nshook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed.\n  \n \n  \"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in\nthis than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds\non my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar.\n  \n \n  Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat\na thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one they\nre-entered the cruiser."}

It must be something else.\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You\nmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing\ntastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of\nlanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n  \n \n  Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and\nstaying alive.\"\n  \n \n  There was no reply.\n  \n \n  His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and\nI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our\npressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n  \n \n  We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our\nhides.\n  \n \n  The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting\ntreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made\nyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever\ntasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under\nmy skin.\n  \n \n  \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n  \n \n  \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your\nwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,\nCaptain?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an\nilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n  \n \n  \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't\nfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of\nCentauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n  \n \n  It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the\nface of such splendor.

The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a\nbouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n  \n \n  \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n  \n \n  I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n  \n \n  The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an\neighty-degree angle.\n  \n \n  I was stone sober.\n  \n \n  The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or\ntaking cover.\n  \n \n  The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer\nsat on his haunches and waited for us to move."}

He threatened\n    \n   to destroy everything that was noble and\n    \n   decent\u2014including my date with my girl!\n   \n \n \n \n  When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken\negg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window\nsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry\nlist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put\nthe roof on the city, as they say.\n  \n \n  It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're\nlucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n  \n \n  But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been\nbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my\nmind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this\nmorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her\nplace. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the\nphone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten\no'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n  \n \n  Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a\nharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a\nfixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,\nof course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,\nwere invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one\nwaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other\nProject and had blown itself up.\n  \n \n  Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three\nyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,\nshortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five\nminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been\nkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from\narriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had\nhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four\ndays.\n  \n \n  And then the elevator didn't come."}
{"id":"THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_2","contents":"Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from\nruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very\nwell throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment\nand I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that\ngaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories\nstraight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal\nspeeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n  \n \n  I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little\nNon-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a\nRomantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.\nTemporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life\nwith you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a\nStraightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at\nleast a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend\nthat time with than you.\"\n  \n \n  Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less\nto anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we\nboth had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that\nLinda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract\nfor any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n  \n \n  So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time\ncame I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more\nthan a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and\nmalfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment\nat five minutes to ten.\n  \n \n  Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.\nIt never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I\nwas giving myself plenty of time.\n  \n \n  But then the elevator didn't come.\n  \n \n  I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't\nunderstand it.\n  \n \n  The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of\nthe button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator\nthat traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred\nsixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for\neither the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than\ntwenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n  \n \n  I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my\nwatch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If\nit didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n  \n \n  It didn't arrive.\n  \n \n  I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator\nwould come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to\ngive her advance warning that I would be late?\n  \n \n  Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second\nalternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my\napartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white\nletters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n  \n \n  Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted\nto say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to\nkeep us from being interrupted.\n  \n \n  Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the\nelevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if\nthe elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute\nlate.\n  \n \n  No matter. It didn't arrive.\n  \n \n  I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility\npiled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day\nwas just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\nthree times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was\nhurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the\ndoor behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of\nthe Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud\nthey'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n  \n \n  I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY."}
{"id":"THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_3","contents":"It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice!

My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n  \n \n  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit.

In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded, wide-eyed.

She whispered, \"They're\nafraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she\nglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n  \n \n  For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been\ntold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all\nthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n  \n \n  What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting\nthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n  \n \n  Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n  \n \n  Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\n  \n \n  The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\n   \n   everybody\n   \n  lived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\n  \n \n  And the Treaty of Oslo.\n  \n \n  It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\n   \n   tactical\n   \n  atomic\nweapons could be used. No\n   \n   strategic\n   \n  atomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\n  \n \n  Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\n  \n \n  However, what with all of the\n   \n   other\n   \n  treaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\n  \n \n  And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that."}
{"id":"THE_SPY_IN_THE_ELEVATOR_4","contents":"But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n  \n \n  When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\n  \n \n  I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n  \n \n  I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\n  \n \n  He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n  \n \n  I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n  \n \n  I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\n  \n \n  Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\n  \n \n  Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n  \n \n  And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n  \n \n  Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\n  \n \n  It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n  \n \n  On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\n  \n \n  I read them. They said:\n  \n \n  EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n   \n  ELEVATOR SHAFT\n   \n  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n   \n  ONLY\n   \n  KEEP LOCKED\n  \n \n  I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n  \n \n  As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\n  \n \n  Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n  \n \n  He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n  \n \n  I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\n  \n \n  He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\n   \n   didn't\n   \n  look like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\n  \n \n  His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n  \n \n  I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\n  \n \n  But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n  \n \n  And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded.\n  \n \n  \"All right. Let's go.\"\n  \n \n  We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment.

But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n  \n \n  \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\""}

{"id":"THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_2","contents":"Dan looked around at the gray walls, with shelves stacked to the low\nceiling with wrapped paintings. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a\nwhite glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk,\nan arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates,\nplastic utensils and a portable radio\u2014all hastily installed at Kelly's\norder. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami,\nliverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a\nwell-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer.\n  \n \n  It wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off\nwithout a hitch.\n  \n \n  Basically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing\nfrom closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was\nobvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large\ncanvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards\u2014and leaving the locks\nundamaged.\n  \n \n  Yet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults\u2014someone\nwho hadn't entered in the usual way.\n  \n \n  Theory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The\nSnithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With\nsuch a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the\nvault\u2014day and night\u2014waiting\u2014he would see for himself how they\noperated.\n  \n \n  He finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of\nthe brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he\nslid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air\ncafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered\nat a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a\nmagazine. It was a cheerful scene; Dan liked it. Still, it hardly\nseemed worth all the effort....\n  \n \n  He went to the wall switch and turned off the lights. The orange glow\nof the filaments died, leaving only a faint illumination from the\nnight-light over the door. When the thieves arrived, it might give him\na momentary advantage if his eyes were adjusted to the dark. He groped\nhis way to the bunk.\n  \n \n  So far, so good, he reflected, stretching out. When they showed up,\nhe'd have to handle everything just right. If he scared them off\nthere'd be no second chance. He would have lost his crack at\u2014whatever\nhis discovery might mean to him.\n  \n \n  But he was ready. Let them come."}
{"id":"THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_3","contents":"Eight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly\nfrom a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded\nshelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.\n  \n \n  The apparition was an open-work cage\u2014about the size and shape of an\nout-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures\nwere visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs.\nThey glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.\n  \n \n  A faint sound cut into the stillness\u2014a descending whine. The cage\nmoved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped,\ncrackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage\nsettled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly\nswitches....\n  \n \n  The glow died.\n  \n \n  Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth\nwas dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it\nwas here\u2014\n  \n \n  Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had\nprepared for the occasion:\n  \n \n \n   Greeting, visitors from the Future....\n   \n \n \n  Hopelessly corny. What about:\n   \n   Welcome to the Twentieth Century....\n   \n \n \n  No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to\nDan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now\nlooked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with\na cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves\nlooked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and\nbalding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed\nDan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the\ntable, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at\nthe stacked shelves.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said.\n\"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\"\n  \n \n  \"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd\nbest hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\"\n  \n \n  \"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\"\n  \n \n  Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.\n  \n \n  \"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Manny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still\nprefer nood dames, Fiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play\nof rich browns!\"\n  \n \n  \"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was\npopular with the sparrows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting\nin the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting\nclattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've\u2014ah\u2014been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\"\nManny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow,\nFiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty\ntough guys when aroused.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the\ngent's room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\"\n  \n \n  Dan shook his head. \"No leak.

But it takes more\nthan the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you were right, Manny,\" Fiorello said. \"Complications are\narising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.\" He edged toward\nthe cage.\n  \n \n  \"What about this ginzo?\" Manny jerked a thumb toward Dan. \"He's on to\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't be helped.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look\u2014I want to go with you!\" Dan shouted.\n  \n \n  \"I'll bet you do!\" Kelly's voice roared. \"One more minute and I'll have\nthe door open and collar the lot of you!

Dan wrestled with him.\nThe pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the\nfar corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted\naside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back\ninto the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault.\n  \n \n  \"Manny!\" Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his\ncompanion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his\nheels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A\ncop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan\ngrabbed a lever at random and pulled.\n  \n \n  Sudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral\nKelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan\nswallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an\nelevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides.\n  \n \n  Hastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky\nbusiness. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing\nin among brick and mortar particles....\n  \n \n  But this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the\nway he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted\u2014in a way.\nThe time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled\nback into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft\nof the past decade on him.\n  \n \n  It couldn't be\n   \n   too\n   \n  hard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the\ncontrols...."}

Dan gritted\nhis teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage.\nThen he was emerging into a spacious kitchen.

So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the\nusual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here\nsomewhere....\n  \n \n  Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.\n  \n \n  A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In\nanother second she would see him, and give the alarm\u2014and Dan needed\na few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls.\nHe moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through\nthe wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever\nback. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a\nfour-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table\u2014\n  \n \n  The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not\nover eighteen, Dan thought\u2014as nearly as he could tell with the blue\nlight playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon,\nand long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis\nracquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and\nthe cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple,\nand began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.\n  \n \n  Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another;\nhe rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the\nzipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward\nthe outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....\n  \n \n  Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering\ntwenty feet above a clipped lawn.\n  \n \n  He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the\ncage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped\nout on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face\nup\u2014\n  \n \n  Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in a\nplain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter\nfilled with glowing blue plants\u2014\n  \n \n  The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she\ntook a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square\nsunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside,\nseemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled\u2014\n  \n \n  With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the\ncage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with\nan acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the\ncontrols, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed\non, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town,\napproaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up\nfifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it\u2014\n  \n \n  He covered his ears, braced himself\u2014\n  \n \n  With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the\ncage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop.\nDan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud\n   \n   click!\n   \n  and the glow faded.\n  \n \n  With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at\na simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through\nelaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a potted\nplant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far\nside of the room a desk. And behind the desk\u2014Something.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a\nhundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from\npoints eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded\nand reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three\npeanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just\nabove the brown eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Who're you?\" a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to Manny and Fiorello?\"\n  \n \n  \"They\u2014I\u2014There was this cop. Kelly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh-oh.\" The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered hands\nclosed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer.\n  \n \n  \"Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted,\" the basso voice said. \"A\npity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still....\" A noise like an\namplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth.\n  \n \n  \"How ... what...?\"\n  \n \n  \"The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below a\ncritical value,\" the voice said. \"A necessary measure to discourage\nbig ideas on the part of wisenheimers in my employ. May I ask how you\nhappen to be aboard the carrier, by the way?\"\n  \n \n  \"I just wanted\u2014I mean, after I figured out\u2014that is, the police ... I\nwent for help,\" Dan finished lamely.\n  \n \n  \"Help? Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one's\nanonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps at\npresent. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?\"\n  \n \n  Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes,\naccustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out\nthe vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed\ngiraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face\nsimilar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted\naround the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire\ninto a black sky.\n  \n \n  \"Too bad.\" The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted,\ncaught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up\nto catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily\nat work studying the ceiling.\n  \n \n  \"I hope,\" the voice said, \"that you ain't harboring no reactionary\nracial prejudices.\""}
{"id":"THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_6","contents":"\"Gosh, no,\" Dan reassured the eye. \"I'm crazy about\u2014uh\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Vorplischers,\" the voice said. \"From Vorplisch, or Vega, as you call\nit.\" The Bronx cheer sounded again. \"How I long to glimpse once more my\nnative fens! Wherever one wanders, there's no pad like home.\"\n  \n \n  \"That reminds me,\" Dan said. \"I have to be running along now.\" He\nsidled toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Stick around, Dan,\" the voice rumbled. \"How about a drink? I can\noffer you Chateau Neuf du Pape, '59, Romance Conte, '32, goat's milk,\nPepsi\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No, thanks.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind, I believe I'll have a Big Orange.\" The Vorplischer\nswiveled to a small refrigerator, removed an immense bottle fitted with\na nipple and turned back to Dan. \"Now, I got a proposition which may be\nof some interest to you. The loss of Manny and Fiorello is a serious\nblow, but we may yet recoup the situation. You made the scene at a most\nopportune time. What I got in mind is, with those two clowns out of the\npicture, a vacancy exists on my staff, which you might well fill. How\ndoes that grab you?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you want me to take over operating the time machine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time machine?\" The brown eyes blinked alternately. \"I fear some\nconfusion exists. I don't quite dig the significance of the term.\"\n  \n \n  \"That thing,\" Dan jabbed a thumb toward the cage. \"The machine I came\nhere in. You want me\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Time machine,\" the voice repeated. \"Some sort of chronometer, perhaps?\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"I pride myself on my command of the local idiom, yet I confess the\nimplied concept snows me.\" The nine-fingered hands folded on the desk.\nThe beachball head leaned forward interestedly. \"Clue me, Dan. What's a\ntime machine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's what you use to travel through time.\"\n  \n \n  The brown eyes blinked in agitated alternation. \"Apparently I've loused\nup my investigation of the local cultural background. I had no idea\nyou were capable of that sort of thing.\" The immense head leaned back,\nthe wide mouth opening and closing rapidly. \"And to think I've been\nspinning my wheels collecting primitive 2-D art!\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014don't you have a time machine? I mean, isn't that one?\"\n  \n \n  \"That? That's merely a carrier. Now tell me more about your time\nmachines. A fascinating concept! My superiors will be delighted at\nthis development\u2014and astonished as well. They regard this planet as\nEndsville.\""}
{"id":"THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_7","contents":"\"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he\ncould reach the machine and try a getaway\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said,\nfollowing Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch\nyellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm\nafraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best\nintroduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth\nClass, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop\nnew sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire\nSecondary Quadrant.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That\n   \n   has\n   \n  to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just\nmaterialize out of thin air like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You\nshouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel,\nthat everyone has. Now\u2014\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper\u2014\"I'll\nmake a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good\ncondition for me. And in return\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  supposed to supply\n   \n   you\n   \n  with a time machine?\"\n  \n \n  Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out,\nDan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal\nentry, illegal possession of property, trespass\u2014then doubtless some\nembarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr.\nKelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would\ndeal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\"\nThe Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the\ndesk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.\n  \n \n  \"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me\ngot the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up\nwith an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I\nshould say. What about it, Dan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously.\n  \n \n  \"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested.\n  \n \n  Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.\n  \n \n  \"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local\nbranch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\"\n  \n \n  \"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\"\n  \n \n  \"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He\ntook the directory, studied it.\n  \n \n  \"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice\nit. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a\nlarge.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel\ncells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in\nthe carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan.\nGet a wiggle on.\""}
{"id":"THE_STAR-SENT_KNAVES_8","contents":"Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a\npoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.\nBlote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct\nme, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.\nFaint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan\nlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n  \n \n  \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped\nsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n  \n \n  \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to\nget us to the right place.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well, Dan.\"\n  \n \n  Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly\nseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage\ngrew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying\nlandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely\nvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\n  \n \n  The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n  \n \n  \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n  \n \n  \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n  \n \n  Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\n  \n \n  A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n  \n \n  The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n  \n \n  The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\n  \n \n  As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n  \n \n  Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\n  \n \n  There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\n   \n   pop!\n   \n  like a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Alors, monsieur\n   \n  ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\n   \n   Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n  \n \n  \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself.

I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\""}

They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\n  \n \n  The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God!

The man and woman descended the gang-plank toward the officials\ngathered on the platform. They glanced around at the massed field of\nwhite faces beneath them; saw those same faces that had been turned\ntoward them two thousand years past; remembered the cheers and the\ncries that had crashed around them then, as they and the thousand had\nstood before the towering spires of the ships, before the takeoff.\n  \n \n  And, as then, there were no children among the milling, grasping\nthrong. Only the same clutching hands and voices and arms, asking for\nan answer, a salvation, a happy end.\n  \n \n  Now the officials gathered around the man and the woman, and spoke to\nthem in voices of reverence.\n  \n \n  A microphone was thrust into Michael's hand with the whispered\nadmonition to tell the people of the great new life waiting for them,\nopen and green and moist, on a virgin planet.\n  \n \n  The cries of the people were slipping away and a stillness growing\nlike an ocean calm and, within it, the sound of the pumps, throbbing,\nsucking the water from the seas.\n  \n \n  And then Michael's voice, \"The thousand who left with us are dead.

{"id":"THE_VALLEY_3","contents":"They ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\n  \n \n  The President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\n  \n \n  Now streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\n  \n \n  The dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\n  \n \n  Now the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\n  \n \n  They were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\n  \n \n  And those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\n  \n \n  The picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\n  \n \n  The watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\n  \n \n  Instantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\n  \n \n  And then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\n  \n \n  Great balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\n  \n \n  At this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\n  \n \n  Another ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\n  \n \n  Lights flashed through the room and the picture died."}

To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\n  \n \n  Michael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\n  \n \n  There were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n  \n \n  \"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were silent.\n  \n \n  \"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\n  \n \n  As the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains."}

And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years.

And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it.

{"id":"THE_VALLEY_6","contents":"They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart.

I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers."}

We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n  \n \n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Proceed.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stared straight at the President.

They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch.

In the background, he heard\nsomeone say, \"I think there's something wrong.\"\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in a\nsavage grimace.\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to face\nthrough their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrously\nlarge to the other.\n  \n \n  Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. One\narm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winship\ncould no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effort\nwas not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry in\ninvoluntary realism.\n  \n \n  This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth.\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins's lips were desperately forming the word \"Leak?\"\n  \n \n  Air, Major Winship said silently.\n  \n \n  Leak?\n  \n \n  Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive."}

Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle.\n  \n \n  \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued.\n\"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to\nwithstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface.

Then clean the area\nthoroughly around the leak.\"\n  \n \n  \"With what?\" asked Major Winship.\n  \n \n  \"Sandpaper, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  \"With sandpaper?\" Major Winship said, emptying the bucket of fluid into\nthe drum. \"We don't have any sandpaper.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been a long day,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n  \n \n  \"Mix it thoroughly,\" Lt. Chandler mused. \"I guess that means let it mix\nfor about ten minutes or so. Then you apply it. It sets for service in\njust a little bit, Finogenov said. An hour or so, maybe.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope this doesn't set on exposure to air.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"It sets by some kind of chemical action.\nGeneral Finogenov wasn't sure of the English name for it. Some kind of\nplastic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's come back to how we're going to clean around the leak,\" Major\nWinship said.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I\u2014\" interrupted Capt. Wilkins. There was a trace of concern\nin his voice. \"This is a hell of a time for this to occur to\nme. I just wasn't thinking, before.\n   \n   You don't suppose it's a\nroom-temperature-curing epoxy resin, do you?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Larry,\" said Major Winship, \"I wouldn't know a room-temperature-curing\nepoxy resin from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" exclaimed Capt.

Let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Out! Out!\"\n  \n \n  Major Winship, Lt. Chandler, and Capt. Lawler, recognizing the sense of\nurgency, simultaneously glanced at the drum. It was glowing cherry red.\n  \n \n  \"Let's go!\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n  \n \n  He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became\ntemporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly\nin the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the\nnecessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them\nfrom behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms\nand legs.\n  \n \n  At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right.\nThe table remained untouched.\n  \n \n  When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off\nlike shrapnel.\" They obeyed.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014what\u2014what?\" Capt. Lawler stuttered.\n  \n \n  They were still separated, two on one side of the airlock, two on the\nother.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going to try to look,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Let me go.\" He\nlumbered directly away from the dome for a distance of about fifteen\nfeet, then turned and positioned himself, some five feet behind the\ntable, on a line of sight with the airlock.\n  \n \n  \"I can see it,\" he said. \"It's getting redder. It's ... it's ...\nmelting, yes. Melting down at the bottom a little. Now it's falling\nover to one side and laying on the air tank. The air tank is getting\nred, too. I'm afraid ... it's weakening it.... Redder. Oh, oh.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" said Capt. Lawler.\n  \n \n  \"Watch out! There.\n   \n   There!\n   \n  \" Capt. Wilkins leaped from his position.\nHe was still floating toward the ground when there was an incredibly\nbright flare from inside the dome, and a great, silent tongue of flame\nlashed through the airlock and rolled across the lunar surface. The\ntable was sent tumbling. The flame was gone almost instantly.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"There went the air,\" Capt. Lawler commented.\n  \n \n  \"We got T-Trouble,\" said Lt. Chandler."}

For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n  \n \n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n  \n \n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\""}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_2","contents":"The gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n  \n \n  Butch yawned.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy\u2014and you, too, Hal\u2014when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n  \n \n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen\u2014and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj\u2014it's contraprogrammed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n  \n \n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n  \n \n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n  \n \n  \"Aw,\n   \n   quit\n   \n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n  \n \n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n  \n \n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\""}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_3","contents":"He kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean if you\n   \n   could\n   \n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup\u2014I want to think.\"\n  \n \n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n  \n \n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n  \n \n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n   \n   you\n   \n  didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater\u2014you're not old enough\nyet\u2014so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n  \n \n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n  \n \n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n   \n   telling\n   \n  me about it, do you?\""}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4","contents":"The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it\u2014Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater.

Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away."}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_5","contents":"It was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n  \n \n  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n  \n \n  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  ,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n  \n \n  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n  \n \n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n  \n \n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n  \n \n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n  \n \n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier\u2014like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury."}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_6","contents":"Hal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in.

His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n  \n \n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n  \n \n  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n  \n \n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\""}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_7","contents":"But the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and\nthen sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and\ngrowled faintly down the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think\nTamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the\nusher as if it weren't there.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.\nThere were two closely spaced faint\n   \n   plops\n   \n  and a large green stain\nappeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from\nthe close-cropped hair of the other.\n  \n \n  They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms\nfolded and wasn't looking at them.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the\nmain entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found\nthemselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch\nthe show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their\nlevitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.\n  \n \n \n \n  The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central\nplatform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat\nflattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the\nbubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale\ncentral glow.\n  \n \n  But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of\nthe boys.\n  \n \n  Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the\nbubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage\nappeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble,\na ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a\nlittle fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about\nwere wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond\nbeards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.\n  \n \n  Here and there were scattered weapons and armor\u2014long swords glistening\nwith oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and\nhelmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean,\nwolflike dogs paced with restless monotony."}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_8","contents":"Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\""}
{"id":"TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9","contents":"As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle.

One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light.

Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and\nseemed to blame you for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or\nsmuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to\nget out of here\u2014before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal\naccident!\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after\na startled pause.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are\nrumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells\nthings to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by\nclaiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him\nthat bad over a little slack managing?\"\n  \n \n  The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters\nbuilding, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet.\n  \n \n  There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a\ndozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of\ndiscarded records.\n  \n \n  \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile\nat the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern.\n  \n \n  \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough\nheat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\"\n  \n \n  He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers.\n  \n \n  \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here.\nHe can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by\nyourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think you'd better.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to\nthe daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a\nlot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking\ndetermined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to\ngive slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his\nheel hard at the corner below the hinge.\n  \n \n  The plastic yielded.\n  \n \n  \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl\nthrough!\""}
{"id":"TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_6","contents":"Hardly sixty seconds later, he led her into a maze of stacked crates\nin the warehouse proper. The building was not much longer than wide,\nfor each of the structures in the colony had its own hemispherical\nemergency dome of transparent plastic. They soon reached the other end.\n  \n \n  \"I think there's a storeroom for spacesuits around here,\" muttered\nTolliver.\n  \n \n  \"Why do you want them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Honey, I just don't think it will be so easy to lay hands on a\ntractor. I bet Jeffers already phoned the garage and all the airlocks\nwith some good lie that will keep me from getting through.\"\n  \n \n  After a brief search, he located the spacesuits. Many, evidently\nintended for replacements, had never been unpacked, but there were a\ndozen or so serviced and standing ready for emergencies. He showed\nBetty how to climb into one, and checked her seals and valves after\ndonning a suit himself.\n  \n \n  \"That switch under your chin,\" he said, touching helmets so she could\nhear him. \"Leave it turned off.\n   \n   Anybody\n   \n  might be listening!\"\n  \n \n  He led the way out a rear door of the warehouse. With the heavy knife\nthat was standard suit equipment, he deliberately slashed a four-foot\nsquare section out of the dome. He motioned to Betty to step through,\nthen trailed along with the plastic under his arm.\n  \n \n  He caught up and touched helmets again.\n  \n \n  \"Just act as if you're on business,\" he told her. \"For all anyone can\nsee, we might be inspecting the dome.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" asked Betty.\n  \n \n  \"Right through the wall, and then head for the nearest mine. Jeffers\ncan't be running\n   \n   everything\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there any way to get to a TV?\" asked the girl. \"I ... uh ... Daddy\ngave me a good number to call if I needed help.\"\n  \n \n  \"How good?\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty official, as a matter of fact.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Tolliver decided. \"We'll try the ship you just came in on.\nThey might have finished refueling and left her empty.\"\n  \n \n  They had to cross one open lane between buildings, and Tolliver was\nvery conscious of moving figures in the distance; but no one seemed to\nlook their way.\n  \n \n  Reaching the foot of the main dome over the establishment, he glanced\nfurtively about, then plunged his knife into the transparent material.\n  \n \n  From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Betty make a startled\ngesture, but he had his work cut out for him. This was tougher than the\ninterior dome.\n  \n \n  Finally, he managed to saw a ragged slit through which they could\nsqueeze. There was room to walk between the inner and outer layer, so\nhe moved along a few yards. A little dust began to blow about where\nthey had gone through. He touched helmets once more.\n  \n \n  \"This time,\" he said, \"the air will really start to blow, so get\nthrough as fast as you can. If I can slap this piece of plastic over\nthe rip, it may stow down the loss of pressure enough to give us quite\na lead before the alarms go off.\"\n  \n \n  Through the faceplates, he saw the girl nod, wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  As soon as he plunged the knife into the outer layer, he could see\ndusty, moist air puffing out into the near-vacuum of Ganymede's\nsurface. Fumbling, he cut as fast as he could and shoved Betty through\nthe small opening.\n  \n \n  Squeezing through in his turn, he left one arm inside to spread the\nplastic sheet as best he could. The internal air pressure slapped it\nagainst the inside of the dome as if glued, although it immediately\nshowed an alarming tendency to balloon through the ruptured spot.\n  \n \n \n   They'll find it, all right\n   \n  , Tolliver reminded himself.\n   \n   Don't be here\nwhen they do!\n   \n \n \n  He grabbed Betty by the wrist of her spacesuit and headed for the\nnearest outcropping of rock.\n  \n \n  It promptly developed that she had something to learn about running on\nice in such low gravity. Until they were out of direct line of sight\nfrom the settlement, Tolliver simply dragged her.\n  \n \n  Then, when he decided that it was safe enough to pause and tell her\nhow to manage better, the sight of her outraged scowl through the\nface-plate made him think better of it.\n  \n \n \n   By the time we reach the ship, she'll have learned\n   \n  , he consoled\nhimself."}
{"id":"TOLLIVER'S_ORBIT_7","contents":"It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on\nGanymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced\nto explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He\nadmitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the\nspaceship.\n  \n \n  There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed\nand stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right,\" Tolliver told the girl. \"We can get in with no\ntrouble.\"\n  \n \n  It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that\nhe caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the\nspot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized\nthe outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting\ndownward again.\n  \n \n  \"In fact, we\n   \n   have\n   \n  to get in to stay out of trouble,\" he said to Betty.\n  \n \n  He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated the\nmechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder.\n  \n \n  It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder and\ninside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting at\nthe time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and then\nTolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was a\nclumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time.\n  \n \n \n \n  In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat,\nglanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet.\n  \n \n  \"Leave the suit on,\" he ordered, getting in the first word while she\nwas still shaking her head. \"It will help a little on the takeoff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Takeoff!\" shrilled Betty. \"What do you think you're going to do? I\njust want to use the radio or TV!\"\n  \n \n  \"That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your\nconversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these\ndials!\"\n  \n \n  He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the\nship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an\neconomy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments,\ndoing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He\nwarned her the trip might be long.\n  \n \n  \"I told you not to come,\" he said at last. \"Now sit back!\"\n  \n \n  He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck,\nand then it was out of his hands for several minutes.\n  \n \n  \"That wasn't so bad,\" Betty admitted some time later. \"Did you go in\nthe right direction?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" retorted Tolliver. \"There wasn't time to check\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . We'll worry about that after we make your call.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" Betty looked helpless. \"It's in my pocket.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry\nher out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any\nfurther help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter.\nWhen Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about\nmaking contact.\n  \n \n  It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored\nexpectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a\nuniform.\n  \n \n  \"Space Patrol?\" whispered Tolliver incredulously.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" said Betty. \"Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out\nof range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared\nexasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who\ncould arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede and\nwondering what was behind it all.\n  \n \n  When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers and\nreporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began to\nsuspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the\nPatrolman."}

Even\nthough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing\nalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.\n  \n \n  \"We'll just have to ride it out,\" he said sympathetically. \"The ship is\nprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't expect to so soon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, you were pretty lucky.

Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n  \n \n  \"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n  \n \n  \"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\n   \n   you\n   \n  going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I thought. And what did you plan to do there?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said stubbornly, \"Well, I sort of figured I'd amuse myself for a\nwhile\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought that, too. And with\n   \n   what\n   \n  , pray, Jones?\"\n  \n \n  \"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\""}
{"id":"TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_4","contents":"Commander Eagan said, \"You'd better find some new way of amusing\nyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said, \"I seen it. But if you think\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It says,\" stated Eagan deliberately, \"'\n   \n   In order that work or rest\nperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered\nthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must\nbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander\n   \n  ,' That\nmeans you, Jones!\"\n  \n \n  \"But, dingbust it!\" keened Isobar, \"it don't disturb nobody for me to\nplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate good\nmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But the Dome,\" pointed out Commander Eagan, \"has an air-conditioning\nsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans of\nyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entire\nstructure.\"\n  \n \n  He suddenly seemed to gain stature.\n  \n \n  \"No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entire\norganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\" said Isobar.\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  Isobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.\nIf now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the last\namusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Look, Commander!\" he pleaded, \"I tell you what I'll do. I won't bother\nnobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Outside!\" Eagan stared at him incredulously. \"Are you mad? How about\nthe Grannies?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of life\nfound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an\nabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar\nexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was\nan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low\nintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and\nimplacable foe.\n  \n \n  Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever\nyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science\nwas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of\nGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, that\nthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something\nharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be\npenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,\nby electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered\natomo-needle dispenser.\n  \n \n  All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:\n  \n \n  \"They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,\" he said, \"for\na 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back\ninside\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" said Commander Eagan flatly. \"Absolutely,\n   \n   no\n   \n  ! I have no time\nfor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,\ngood afternoon!\"\n  \n \n  He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't play\nyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all the\nawful screeching wails\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfect\nfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and from\nhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley looked\nstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violent\nprofanity.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, dagnab it!\" fumed Isobar Jones. \"Oh, tarnation and dingbust!\nOh\u2014\n   \n   fiddlesticks\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"And so,\" chuckled Riley, \"he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hot\noven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.\"\n  \n \n  Some minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.\nLoesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older man\nnodded commiseratingly.\n  \n \n  \"It is funny, yes,\" he agreed, \"but at the same time it is not\naltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, our\npoor Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, I know,\" said Riley, \"but, hell, we all get a little bit\nhomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Excuse me, my boy,\" interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,\n\"it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is something\ndeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:\n   \n   weltschmertz\n   \n  . There is no accurate translation in English. It means\n'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that but\nintensified a thousandfold.\n  \n \n  \"It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frame\nof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on which\nthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad acts\nof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean,\" demanded Sparks anxiously, \"Isobar ain't got all his\nbuttons?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass\nof despair. He may try\n   \n   anything\n   \n  to retrieve his lost happiness, rid\nhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying\nhunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Below, I guess. In his quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he will\nfind peace and forgetfulness.\"\n  \n \n  But Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power the\n\"giftie gi'en\" him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.\n  \n \n  Isobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, he\nwas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtive\nculprit.\n  \n \n  Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with Dome\nCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein was\nencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from their\npegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.\n  \n \n  \"So I can't play you, huh?\" he muttered darkly. \"It disturbs the peace\no' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll\n   \n   see\n   \n  about that!\"\n  \n \n  And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the\nroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge\n   \n   impervite\n   \n  gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway\nto Outside.\n  \n \n  On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle\nadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. But\ntoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might venture\nout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might have\nto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian of\nthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.\n  \n \n  Up to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exuding\nan aura of propriety.\n  \n \n  \"Very well, Wilkins,\" he said. \"I'll take over now. You may go to the\nmeeting.\"\n  \n \n  Wilkins looked at him bewilderedly.\n  \n \n  \"Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's eyebrows arched.\n  \n \n  \"You mean you haven't been notified?\"\n  \n \n  \"Notified of\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that I\nwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ain't,\" puzzled Wilkins, \"heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought to\ncall the office, maybe?\"\n  \n \n  And he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. \"That\u2014er\u2014won't\nbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just run\nalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We-e-ell,\" said Wilkins, \"if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a\nsharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back\nsudden-like.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" promised Isobar, \"don't worry.\""}
{"id":"TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_5","contents":"Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\n  \n \n  A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\n  \n \n  Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\n  \n \n  How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\n  \n \n  It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\n  \n \n  He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\n  \n \n  And the shooting? That could only be\u2014\n  \n \n  He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\n  \n \n  And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n  \n \n  \"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n  \n \n  \"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\n   \n   alone\n   \n  ! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\n   \n   not\n   \n  a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\n  \n \n  Roberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n  \n \n  \"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\n  \n \n  For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\n  \n \n  Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!"}
{"id":"TROUBLE_ON_TYCHO_6","contents":"Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n  \n \n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n  \n \n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n  \n \n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n  \n \n  \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stop talking!\n   \n  \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\n   \n   Blow!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\n  \n \n \n \n   Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\n   \n \n \n \n  He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Haa-a-roong!\n   \n  \" blew Isobar Jones.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\n  \n \n  As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\n  \n \n  So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n  \n \n  \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\n   \n   like\n   \n  it! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\n  \n \n  And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\n   \n   piobaireachd\n   \n  into\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\n   \n   can\n   \n  hear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\n  \n \n  Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it; the Grannies\n   \n   liked\n   \n  this music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\n  \n \n  Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\n   \n   dared\n   \n  not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\n   \n   Rhoderik Dhu\n   \n  and the lilting\n   \n   Lassies\nO'Skye\n   \n  , the mournful\n   \n   Coghiegh nha Shie\n   \n  whose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\n  \n \n \n   The Cock o' the North\n   \n  , he played, and\n   \n   Mironton\n   \n  ...\n   \n   Wee Flow'r o'\nDee\n   \n  and\n   \n   MacArthur's March\n   \n  ...\n   \n   La Cucuracha\n   \n  and\u2014\n  \n \n  And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n  \n \n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\n  \n \n  And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n  \n \n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\n  \n \n  Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n  \n \n  \"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\n   \n   those Grannies are\nstone dead\n   \n  !\""}

The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway.

{"id":"UNBORN_TOMORROW_5","contents":"There are seven major brewers in\nthe Munich area, each of them represented\nby one of the circuslike tents\nthat Mr. Oyster mentioned.

In the center\nis a tremendous bandstand, the\nmusicians all\n   \n   lederhosen\n   \n  clad, the\nmusic as Bavarian as any to be found\nin a Bavarian beer hall.

But not for some men and most boys!\n  \n \n \n  I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n  \n \n  Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n  \n \n  I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !"}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_2","contents":"It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and\nbehind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out\nof sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white\ndoors\u2014on and on and on.\n   \n   Gee\n   \n  , I thought excitedly, this is\n   \n   one big\nship\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of\nstars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing\nthat gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in\n   \n   The Boy\nRocketeers\n   \n  , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n  \n \n  So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned\nleft. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading\ninward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix\ngoing\n   \n   purr-purr-purrty-purr\n   \n  in the comforting way big machinery has\nwhen it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the\nway to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were\nportholes on the hull.\n  \n \n  I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on\nthe transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the\nceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like\nthe dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in\ncase of emergency. I looked for the\n   \n   important\n   \n  things.\n  \n \n  As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't\ndecided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,\nI'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity\nunderfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf\nof Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make\nfaces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n  \n \n  Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the\nwall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block\nthe crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed\ninto the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits\nstanding in them, like those knights they used to have back in the\nMiddle Ages.\n  \n \n  \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of\ncompanionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass\nwith hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the\nfollowing fashion.\"\n  \n \n  I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart.\n   \n   Boy\n   \n  , I said\nto myself,\n   \n   I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get\ninto one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits\nback in Undersea!\n   \n \n \n  And all the time I was alone. That was the best part."}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_3","contents":"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers\nnot permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n  \n \n  I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\ncould see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\nvelvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\nexisted in the Universe.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\ndistance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\nIf I just took one quick look....\n  \n \n  But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\nThen I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\nCitizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\ndidn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\nget an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\ncareful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\nmen.\n  \n \n  \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\ncan't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\nPassport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\nclause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\nthis number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\npertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\nyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\nNo matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\nthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\n   \n   Women\n   \n  like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\nmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\nwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n  \n \n  Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\nwith me. I knew what Sis could say to\n   \n   that\n   \n  , but at least it was an\nargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n  \n \n  I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\nthe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\nmovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\noff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\nmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\nagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\nMarsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n  \n \n  Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\nblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\nwall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\nThirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n  \n \n  Another one of those signs."}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_4","contents":"I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out\nthe stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked\nunder the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get\ninto it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I\nknew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open\nit with. Not even a button you could press.\n  \n \n  That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps\nback home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock\ncombinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice\nkey\u2014might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n  \n \n  \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n  \n \n  For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million\npossible combinations\u2014The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and\na hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed\naround my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n  \n \n  I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and\nsat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found\nmyself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the\ncold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\n  \n \n \n \n  He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that\nlooked hard and soft at the same time.\n  \n \n  His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his\nback.\n  \n \n  And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the\ndeep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards\nin New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation\u2014the kind of tan\nthat comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His\nhair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long\ncombed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down\nto his shoulders.\n  \n \n  I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;\nevery man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable\nsoup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the\nblaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,\nwhen I suddenly got scared right through.\n  \n \n  His eyes.\n  \n \n  They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.\nJust coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did\nit, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a\nsurface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it\nopened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n  \n \n  \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting\njumpy enough to splash.\"\n  \n \n  Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly\nleather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted\nto my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n  \n \n  I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand\nSparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you\nseem\u2014tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come\nfrom Flatfolk ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?\nWhat part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the\nlifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a\nsharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a\nboss-minded sister.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \"\n   \n   We're\n   \n  from Undersea.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Dryhorn\n   \n  , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just\nlike on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him\nhow Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when\nthe mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers\nfigured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms."}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_5","contents":"He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were\nbubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just\nabout the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n  \n \n  He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the\nfirst couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I\ntold him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood\nlistening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked\ndisgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World\nCouncil, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after\nthe Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution."}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_6","contents":"He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\nup in a surfacing boat.\n  \n \n  \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\nmight as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\nshe figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n  \n \n  \"How's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\nEarth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\nback in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\nthe wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\nor get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\nplanets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\nhusband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n  \n \n  The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\nanura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\nbellyful!\"\n  \n \n  He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\nable to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\nislands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\nsurplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\nplanet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in\nschool used to say.\n  \n \n  The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\nto register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\nthrew a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\nnasty about the length of his hair; and\n   \n   imagine\n   \n  !\u2014he not only\nresisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\nsassed the judge in open court!\n  \n \n  \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\nattorneys. Told\n   \n   her\n   \n  that where\n   \n   I\n   \n  came from, a man spoke his piece\nwhen he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took\nmy last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the\nrest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for\na moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those\nfancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,\nthey call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken\nmother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.\nMy pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking\nfor me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\""}
{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_7","contents":"For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\n\"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\nAnd I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n  \n \n  He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\n\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what\nbusiness do\n   \n   you\n   \n  have this close to the hull?\"\n  \n \n  After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also\nbecome a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n  \n \n  He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\nmyself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\ninsists such things have always had for men.\n  \n \n  \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\ncall you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n  \n \n  I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\nblaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\neighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\nall us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\nname they were saving for a girl.\"\n  \n \n  \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\nwere all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all\nexcept me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\nTook a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\nthe Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n  \n \n  I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\nthe blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with\nthat, Mr. Butt?\"\n  \n \n  \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at\nthe light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government\npaddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter.

{"id":"Venus_Is_a_Man's_World_8","contents":"He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\nwhen the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\ngrowing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\noff-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\nfruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\nand Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n  \n \n  Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\nbeen pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\nto handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\nlike seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\nTwice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\nand I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\nabout Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n  \n \n  I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\nnative Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\nbetween a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\nslaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\nButt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\nso carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\nthe tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\nmatter what, he would never let me hold it.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\nthe control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look\nat it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\ngiant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found.

But there\nwas a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\ninstance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\ntell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\nthe average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\nspeak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\nmuch as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\npump regulation.\n  \n \n  How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?"}

I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\nhim. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\nlittle better.\n  \n \n  The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was\nwith me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\nfingers.

She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed\nsternly.\n  \n \n  \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in\nclass, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political\ncrime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away\nwithout paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores\nintended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\""}

He paused once to peer through a\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  set into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\n  \n \n  He moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\n  \n \n  His footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\n  \n \n  J. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\n  \n \n  On Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\n  \n \n  She gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\n  \n \n  On J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\n  \n \n  But\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\n  \n \n  The sound of his own name startled Greg.\n  \n \n  \"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n  \n \n  \"It's the very\n   \n   best\n   \n  Martian honey,\" said his wife.\n  \n \n  \"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n  \n \n  \"It's still bitter,\" said J.

And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\n   \n   Malcolm!\n   \n  Where\n   \n   are\n   \n  you?\"\n  \n \n  \"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room.

Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway?

Is there\u2014danger?\"\n  \n \n  But Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him.

We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours.

Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n  \n \n  \"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\n  \n \n  Bert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n  \n \n  \"Sure I'm drunk! Why not?

Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\n  \n \n  J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\n  \n \n  Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body.

Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n  \n \n  \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n  \n \n  \"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\n   \n   quick\n   \n  ! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\n  \n \n  He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\n  \n \n  Then the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\n  \n \n  Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\n  \n \n  Somewhere in space. He looked through the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  . What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\n  \n \n  For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  ; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\n  \n \n  And Greg Malcolm turned from the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , shaken.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n  \n \n  Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\""}

His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n  \n \n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n  \n \n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n  \n \n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n  \n \n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n  \n \n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n  \n \n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed."}
{"id":"Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_5","contents":"Only a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\n  \n \n  Only a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\nbounce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Then they struck!\n  \n \n  But they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high\n   \n   ping!\n   \n  of stress; somewhere aft\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\nthey were safe.\n  \n \n  Breath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\nnice work!\"\n  \n \n  But surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\n  \n \n  \"It would have been\n   \n   better\n   \n  work, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\nOur only\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\nMalcolm\u2014after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\n  \n \n  Instinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\nnormal.\n  \n \n  He said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\nbroken skiff."}
{"id":"Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_6","contents":"Hannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n  \n \n  \"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n  \n \n  \"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\n   \n   anything\n   \n  .\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Malcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\n  \n \n  Sparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\n  \n \n  The gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n  \n \n  'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\n   \n   so\n   \n  hungry)!\n  \n \n  Bert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n  \n \n  \"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly."}
{"id":"Wanderers_of_the_Wolf_Moon_7","contents":"Greg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\n  \n \n  He saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\n  \n \n  He nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n  \n \n  \"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n  \n \n  \"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\n   \n   dangerous\n   \n  ! There are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Ralph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\n  \n \n  And J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\n  \n \n  Sparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hannigan groaned and followed him.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Breadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\n  \n \n  Hannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I said.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\n  \n \n  Breadon flushed darkly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n  \n \n  \"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  . Best equipment throughout.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\n   \n   am\n   \n  a radio operator, and there\n   \n   was\n   \n  a radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\n  \n \n  Greg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon frowned.\n  \n \n  \"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Breadon glared at him wrathfully.\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\n   \n   SOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\n   \n  They'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\n  \n \n  Maud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n  \n \n  \"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\""}

It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday."}
{"id":"What_is_POSAT?_2","contents":"At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\""}
{"id":"What_is_POSAT?_3","contents":"Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply."}
{"id":"What_is_POSAT?_4","contents":"Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said."}

The man in gray flannels and sweatshirt let the\nsail come crumpling down and hurried past its white folds at a gait\nmade comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky ledge\ncame nearer. Slowly the blue V inscribed on the cove's surface by the\nsloop's prow died. Sloop and ledge kissed so gently that he hardly had\nto reach out his hand.\n  \n \n  He scrambled ashore, dipping a sneaker in the icy water, and threw the\nline around a boulder. Unkinking himself, he looked back through the\ncove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands\nand the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed\nin satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing\nevery man yearns to do once in his lifetime\u2014gone to the farthest\nisland out.\n  \n \n  He must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he\ndropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  had\nalways been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock\nhad faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the\nquietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically,\npaused here to rest. As if all changes were erased on this one bit of\nEarth.\n  \n \n  The man's lean, melancholy face crinkled into a grin at the banal\nfancy. He turned his back on his new friend, the little green sloop,\nwithout one thought for his nets and specimen bottles, and set out to\nexplore. The ground rose steeply at first and the oaks were close, but\nafter a little way things went downhill and the leaves thinned and he\ncame out on more rocks\u2014and realized that he hadn't quite gone to the\nfarthest one out."}
{"id":"Yesterday_House_2","contents":"Joined to this island by a rocky spine, which at the present low tide\nwould have been dry but for the spray, was another green, high island\nthat the first had masked from him all the while he had been sailing.\nHe felt a thrill of discovery, just as he'd wondered back in the woods\nwhether his might not be the first human feet to kick through the\nunderbrush. After all, there were thousands of these islands.\n  \n \n  Then he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving\nsmoothly enough.\n  \n \n  To the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still. It even\nbegan with another deep cove, in which he glimpsed the spiny spheres\nof sea urchins. But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his\ntrousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought\nof what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up\nfrom here in a storm.\n  \n \n  He crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced\nthrough a fringe of trees\u2014and came straight up against an eight-foot\nfence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short\ndistance with high, heavy shrubbery.\n  \n \n  Without pausing for surprise\u2014in fact, in his holiday mood, using\nsurprise as a goad\u2014he jumped for the branch of an oak whose trunk\ntouched the fence, scorning the easier lower branch on the other side\nof the tree. Then he drew himself up, worked his way to some higher\nbranches that crossed the fence, and dropped down inside.\n  \n \n  Suddenly cautious, he gently parted the shrubbery and, before the first\nsurprise could really sink in, had another.\n  \n \n \n \n  A closely mown lawn dotted with more shrubbery ran up to a snug white\nCape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretched the\nlength of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just\nin front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he\nrecognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole\nscene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove.\n  \n \n  Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door\nopened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged\ndress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the\nEssex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug\nbravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees.\n  \n \n  The door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a\nwhite silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height\nwaistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound\nwith a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark\nnecklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked\nunder her arm.\n  \n \n  She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table\nbetween three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across\nthe lawn."}

As if, the man thought, he were not an\nordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet.\n  \n \n  Approaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath\nwas coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician\nface that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy\nthat reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than\neighteen.\n  \n \n  He stopped short of the table.

But I was to get started anyhow.\nWhen I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich\u2014she's a drab sort of\nperson\u2014said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of\ncourse, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as\nif she were saying it for the first time.\n  \n \n  \"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n  \n \n  The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to\ntalk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I never go to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his\nmind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are\nvery capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You\ncan't be shut off this way from people your own age!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or\na man before, except in movies.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, it's true.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why\nare they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\""}

A surprised squirrel, lacking\ntime to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of\nhim. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked\ntogether just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to\neither side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a\nsqueak.\n  \n \n  Jack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray\nfrom the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he\nstumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought\nhis way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line\nof the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  , dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could,\nplunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled\naboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.\n  \n \n  As soon as the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  was nosing out of the cove into the cross\nwaves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent\nthe sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail,\nand plunging ahead.\n  \n \n  For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind\nand the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his\nattention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't\nhave to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion,\nand wonder about flappers and hidden traps.\n  \n \n  When he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how\ntiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland.\n  \n \n  Then he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly\novertook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in\nthe bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair\nthat whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that\nit was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches\nover the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to\nthe roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.\n  \n \n  But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves\ndrenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for\na minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.\n  \n \n  Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross\nhis bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail,\nwatching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him.

Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n  \n \n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n  \n \n \n \n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n  \n \n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n  \n \n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress\u2014flowered rather than white\u2014no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n  \n \n  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n  \n \n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n  \n \n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\""}
{"id":"Yesterday_House_9","contents":"With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home."}

He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained."}

After a long look at the cabinet\u2014he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone\u2014he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n  \n \n  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n  \n \n  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n  \n \n  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n  \n \n  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n  \n \n  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n  \n \n  He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n  \n \n  When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling.
